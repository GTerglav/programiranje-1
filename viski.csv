60,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Five Malt,,American Blended Whiskey,50,"Four barley types—two row, pale chocolate, kiln coffee, and Carafa—and malted wheat; aged 6 months in used Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels. Initial pungency and varnish. Then freshly-cut grass, petrol, wood shavings, and a slight hint of chocolate. New make mouthfeel. A hint of honey and milk chocolate is quickly overtaken by an astringent finish. In another few years, maybe this will become more palatable, but this is far from ready, and bourbon remains this distiller’s strong suit. 375ml",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
60,Cavalry,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Although it’s not on the label, Cavalry uses the TerrePURE technology on 4 month old MGP whiskey. Its short time in wood shows. No traditional notes of bourbon sweetness, not even an earthy hint of wood found in many younger bourbons. This is more reminiscent of a neutral grain spirit than bourbon, but masked in the alcohol-centric flavor is a slight sweetness likely representing oak and a hint of grain. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
65,Chinook Limited Edition Signature Rye Whisky,,Canadian,17,"With its overt floral perfume notes and the scent of children’s powdered candy, this whisky is difficult to enjoy. Its unctuous artificial flavors are equally unsuitable for cocktails, mixing, or sipping. Fruity, winey, lavender notes duke it out with baby cereal and artificial coconut. The saving graces? A late lovely bitterness, long gingery burn, and creamy body. But then jujubes, grape gum and artificial bananas kick in and it’s over.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
65,Iowa Legendary Rye,40.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"An unaged whiskey from Carroll County, Iowa, with rye grain and sugar mash. The nose is all kinds of barnyard funk: hay, horse, and manure. Underneath is a bite of sugar and vanilla. On the palate it’s less funky, with sugar, strawberry, and a grappa-like note. The rye spice emerges mid-palate, but it’s fleeting and leads to an edgy and fractured finish. Time in oak might help, but there are issues here that wood won’t resolve.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
67,American Born Dixie Sweet Tea Moonshine,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,22,"This flavored moonshine smells like a mass of wet, used tea bags. Underneath is some faint lemon, honey, and black pepper, but it’s hard to get to it through the tea. Entry is strong, oversteeped tea, which only gets stronger, more tannic, and more bitter in the mid-palate. Syrupy lemon honey tries and fails to balance this oversteeped mess. Finish is long, bitter, slightly hot, and unpleasant. Do not attempt to drink without copious amounts of crushed ice.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
67,Southern Comfort Fiery Pepper,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Does a nose of bright bubble gum and fresh-cut peppers touched by the fermented heat of Tabasco sound good? It comes bursting out of the glass with this one, busy and hot. The taste hits first with the bubble gum blast, sweet and light, even quickly pleasant until the pepper breaks in, twisting and warping this liqueur with a whirl of sweet, hot, bitter, vegetal flavors that turns to a sticky-sweet heat in the finish.   A regrettably bad idea.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
68,Freedom Moonshine Apple Pie Rye,20.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,20,"The aromas from the base rye moonshine complement the apple much better here than in Freedom’s other flavored offerings. Baked apple mixes with cinnamon and is supported by a bread undertone. The apple note comes off as just a little too artificial. Like the other Freedom Moonshine products, the entry is too soft and flat. The biggest problem here clearly is the proof. There’s just not enough structure to do anything with this moonshine: mix, ice, or otherwise enjoy.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
68,Southern Shine Blueberry Moonshine,50.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,16,"All of the elements that work with Southern Shine’s Apple Pie bottling don’t work with their Blueberry. An extremely evasive nose leads to an artificially-flavored palate. Here the blueberry tastes more like flavored bubblegum than fruit. The white pepper from the base spirit clashes with the berry like a multi-car pileup. The finish is hot, too dry, and a little sour. There’s just nothing about this that’s pleasant or enjoyable.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
69,Cabin Fever,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,21,"Real maple syrup has an earthy, woodsy aroma; maple flavoring has strong overtones of coconut, and so does Cabin Fever. The nose evokes dried, sweetened baking coconut, while the sweet and spicy palate is a hot, liquid, coconut macaroon. Peppery notes suggest that it’s whisky, but without any traces of barrel aging that’s as close as you get. Best part? The long, spicy finish with its confection-sweet coconut.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
70,Sailboat,40.0,Canadian,15,"Traces of burnt caramel add interest to an otherwise simple, overly sweet palate. A triumvirate of alcohol, chocolate toffee, and pepper. A slight bitterness is more distracting than pleasing or refreshing. Reminiscent of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup, Sailboat is just too sweet to sip solo, but adding ginger ale increases the complexity, as spirit and sweetness mingle with ginger and carbonation. It would benefit from a bit more wood. A very inexpensive whisky, though not a bargain. $20 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
70,Jim Beam Rye,40.0,Rye Whiskey,16,"For rye whiskey drinkers, Jim Beam isn’t the name you’re usually looking for, but there’s a distinct rye nose: menthol, dill, herbs, and boiling oats. The palate is dull, lacking the up-front spice typically found in ryes, and only shows hints of vanilla, caramel, and eventually cinnamon. The extremely short finish leaves me wondering if it would fare better at a higher proof.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
70,American Born Apple Pie Moonshine,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,22,"Spiced apple cider on the nose is a little more spice than cider, with strong cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Baked apple is there on the opening, but it doesn’t take long for the spices to take over, especially the cinnamon, which dominates. The cinnamon here leans more toward Red Hots than cinnamon stick, and by the time we get to the finish, it has completely conquered this spirit. May have been better labeled Spicy Cinnamon Apple Pie Moonshine.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
70,Kansas Clean Distilled,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Clear, slight golden hue; as expected from a 7% straight whiskey/93% grain neutral spirit “spirit whiskey.” Faint nose of sweet caramel corn in a hot bloom of estery alcohol. Thickly sweet in the mouth, with barely a hint of whiskey, like a badly-made cocktail or an ill-conceived flavored vodka. While there are no glaring flaws in the make, this is simply a bad idea. Light whiskey failed once, in the 1970s, and for good reasons. Those reasons haven't changed.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
70,Fireball Cinnamon Whisky,33.0,Canadian,,"It does say “whisky” on the label...followed by “with natural cinnamon flavor.” It's clear from the first sniff that this is a one-trick pony: hot, fiery cinnamon. But is there whisky flavor in there? Fireball's as sweet as the liqueur proof would indicate, and as hot as advertised, and there's only a hint of whisky character under the fire. A novelty for tailgating; probably great in hot chocolate. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
71,Wieser Wiesky Pinot Noir 7 year old,40.0,Austrian Whisky,50,"The wine cask anoints a gentle amber hue to this natural-colored whisky that has a nose redolent of wine gums. It has a firm texture with early promises of apple and blackberry, but then the flavors tumble off a cliff; a mouth-puckering bedlam of unsweetened rhubarb, cough medicine, licorice, and aniseed. A dash of water extinguishes many of the sour notes, but any redeeming qualities are weakened too, leaving it bland and saggy. Hard to love this one.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
71,Peaden Brothers Genuine Corn Whiskey Moonshine Fox 382 Special Edition,50.0,Craft Whiskey,30,"The nose starts with sweet corn, cornmeal, yeasty bread, and black pepper, with wet dog and a slight varnishy note right behind. The entry is soft and round, with dry cornmeal, bran flakes, and yeasty bread. Unfortunately, the varnish note from the nose returns pretty clearly in the mid-palate along with black pepper. Everything wraps up with a shorter than expected finish. The heart of this whiskey is interesting, but it could benefit from a much tighter cut. (<em>distillery store only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
71,Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,15,"One of the most popular flavored whiskies today is Fireball cinnamon, so it’s no surprise that other cinnamon whiskies are entering the market. This one has a lovely, woody, cinnamon nose that bursts into sweet, blistering cinnamon on the palate. Cinnamon is a natural whisky flavor, but here, rather than complement the underlying whisky, it completely masks it. This is a cinnamon liqueur, and a good one. A fun shooter, perhaps, but it’s barely whisky.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
72,Wieser Wiesky Sherry Wood 7 year old,40.0,Austrian Whisky,50,"A quadruple-distilled whisky in a glass-stoppered bottle, the sherry influence has left its mark on the nose with ripe Victoria plums, glacé cherry, ripening strawberries, icing sugar, and mixed peel. Too bad the flavors are profoundly bitter and minty, producing an expression on this reviewer’s face like a flinching child reluctantly ingesting an unwelcome spoonful of medicine. More palatable and fruity as it dilutes, some spearmint returns on the finish, but it was game over by then.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
72,Beach Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"There are flavored—cinnamon and coconut—versions at lower proof; this is the “Original,” unflavored at full proof. Unaged and clear, the aroma is clean and full of roasted corn and a ripple of deep caramel. Surprisingly appealing, actually. Tastes like raw new make, though: green, feinty, vegetal, and crying out for cola, ginger ale, even Mountain Dew to help mask it. Are we done with ‘moonshine’ yet? Please?",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
72,Texas Spirit,40.0,Canadian,15,"Maple syrup and gelatin capsules in a veterinarian’s office. Texas Spirit is WB Liquors’ (Costco) house brand and so, available in one size only: extra-large. A simple mixing whisky, it is sweet, floral, watery, and loaded with vanilla and caramel. Extra hot pepper throws it a bit out of balance, though it would likely go well with Coke. A young, unassuming whisky not to savor, but to session. Price is per 1.75 liter.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
72,Feisty Spirits Better Days Bourbon,44.0,Craft Whiskey,48,"Aged for “at least” one month, this bourbon is a collaboration with the band Fierce Dead Rabbit. Better Days is pale gold and noticeably cloudy. On the nose it’s paste, yeasty bread dough, and wet pavement. On the palate it is all over the place with raw oak, cinnamon, almond, and black pepper. There&#039;s no balance and no integration. The finish is short, hot, and dry. As whiskey ages, it goes through odd, awkward phases, and that&#039;s where this one is.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
72,Navazos-Palazzi Grain Single Palo Cortado Cask,,Spanish Whisky,100,"No age statement on this grain whisky made from Spanish corn and aged in Palo Cortado sherry casks. Whereas the Navazos-Palazzi malt captured the richness of the sherry, the grain seems to pull the more acidic and dry qualities. Here it&#039;s dry sherry, coffee bean, brown sugar, and white pepper. Much hotter and drier than the Navazos-Palazzi malt, it explodes with heat and spice. This grain whisky was probably never meant to be consumed unblended, and it shows. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
72,Freedom Moonshine White Rye,40.0,Craft Whiskey,20,"Many moonshine products are centered around corn, but Freedom Moonshine mixes it up with a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. Yeasty rye bread defines the nose with an undercurrent of white grape. The entry is soft, with yeasty rye, vanilla, and bran flakes. There’s some structure in the mid-palate with rye spice and black pepper but it needs more. The finish is a little flat, all pointing to the need for a slightly higher proof.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
72,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection (Made with Oats),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Perhaps my least favorite of all the Experimental Collection releases to date. The nose shows nicely, but it comes across as rather aggressive and harsh on the palate toward the finish, which the label describes as being “earthy.” Otherwise, the whiskey is pleasantly sweet, with molasses, date, and fig, plus charcoal, leather, and bitter resin in the mix. Price is per 375 ml.  ",John Hansell,Spring 2012
72,Jeremiah Weed Cherry Mash Flavored,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Artificial cherry aroma, like cherry PEZ, and barely a hint of bourbon. The taste is not overpoweringly sweet at all, a surprise, and there's a nutty, almost Luxardo-like character in the cherry that would be more interesting if it weren't for the soapy notes and bitter medicinal flavor of the whiskey. A more natural cherry character would net a higher rating.  ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
73,Virginia Black American Whiskey,40.0,Miscellaneous,35,"Sourced whiskey from MGP, it’s fairly muted with hints of dill, oregano, basil, sawdust, hay, and mint. Then vegetal, cherry cough syrup, and candy corn notes over cola, maple, and oak. Traces of baking spices appear just before sweet syrup over an extremely short finish. Although many notes appeared, none were particularly pronounced.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
73,Rogue Oregon Single Malt,40.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Showing its youth through an obvious green character that peers from beneath a cloak of campfire and applewood smoke, with banana as the prominent fruit, along with secondary apple, citrus, and a peculiar rubber tire note. The palate is light-bodied and overtly sweet, with grass, marshmallow, and vanilla. Reminiscent of a Lowland malt, which only contributes to the disjointed feeling of the whole package.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
73,Arizona Distilling Copper City Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,53,"The nose on this whiskey is like smelling a wet empty barrel; it&#039;s all oak, char, and cinnamon spice. The entry is thin, watery, and understated with light caramel and cinnamon. In the mid-palate, the oak tannins completely take over. It&#039;s not just oak spice, but the puckeringly dry, sour, and bitter tannins. This all leads to a bitter, bone dry finish. Good whiskey is a conversation between spirit and wood, but here the wood is doing all the talking.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
73,Catch Fire Cinnamon,30.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,12,"Cinnamon is reputed to have medicinal qualities, but you can bet those who drink Catch Fire Cinnamon do so for the incinerating jolt of sweet, spicy heat. Cinnamon hearts and hints of grain dust, almost like those cinnamon sticks in Christmas punch. Sweet, but not cloying. A creamy mouthfeel and touch of whisky wood remind us, if vaguely, that Catch Fire is whisky. The Lynne Truss of flavored whiskies: shoots, winces, and leaves with a long glowing finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2014
73,Spicebox Pumpkin Spiced Whisky,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,20,"Early trial batches of this whisky, flavored by cold infusion, tasted like sweet, roasted squash. However, the final version that we have here is as inviting as the nutmeg-laced pumpkin pie it so resembles. Sweet vanilla and salt water taffy fill the air, with rummy Christmas eggnog taking up the rear. Unusual in that it’s sweet but not syrupy. Hot pepper lingers, as do sweet tingling spices, but the whisky notes just barely show their presence. (<em>Canada only) </em>C$22",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
73,Spicebox Cinnamon Whisky Lot 1642,33.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,17,"Cinnamon hearts. Very sweet and crazy hot with cinnamon. The cinnamon so dominates this liqueur-like drink that very little whisky manages to peek through until the very end of a long, murderously hot finish. Even then, cinnamon overrides the whiskyness, leaving a drink rather than a dram. Fun, yes, great fun, and almost certainly a bracing shooter, but it may be difficult to convince the whisky aficionado to think of this as whisky.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
73,Canadian Five Star,40.0,Canadian,,"A tad thin for sipping, Five Star is a quintessential mixing whisky, laden with dusty rye and citrus pith; it begs for ginger ale. First, though, sip it neat, and feel it blossom in your mouth; it brims with spirit, caramel, and blistering pepper. Behind these linger orange zest, herbaceous tones, creamy corn, and refreshing bitterness. Tingling rye spices that play off the pepper perk up its sweet fruitiness. Now mix it, and delight in its straightforward simplicity. (Canada only) C$22",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
73,Canadian Club Dock No. 57 Blackberry,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"When they say berry, they mean berries: baskets of blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, until suddenly the palate veers off into grape popsicles. This is one sweet, unabashedly faux-fruity potation, but other than traces of oak, not much whisky flavor remains. Still, in the right hands it could be a lot of cocktail fun. Rather than serving it in a whisky glass, a dram or two on French vanilla or coconut-milk ice cream is genuinely scrumptious. ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
73,Koval American Oat,40.0,White Whiskey,,"Very similar to the Midwest Wheat in aroma, with a slight additional tanginess…but that could be from sensory deprivation. Drier in the mouth, with a slight medicinal character to it that increases as the finish goes on; like a high school chemistry lab storeroom, or a bottle of fresh aspirin. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
73,Catoctin Creek Mosby’s Spirit,40.0,White Whiskey,,"Made from 100&#37; rye, and USDA certified organic. Very hot for 40&#37;; herbal nose, very green with rye. Much smoother on the palate, and very quick. There’s a fast shot of rye mint up front, some grassiness, and a sharp flick of heat…and then it vanishes, leaving only a fading flinty-sweet afternote. Clean, but not a lot of substance.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
74,Backbone Prime Blended Bourbon (batch 3),52.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Up front it is extremely off-putting, with overwhelming medicinal, musk, and anise notes, but herbs, candied fruit, and shrubs offer a semblance of hope. Finally, caramel and vanilla appear, though short, overtaken by raw sweet corn and oats. Grain doesn’t go away; it almost masks specks of brown sugar and citrus before a short finish with an unrelenting bitterness.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
74,Oppidan Malted Rye,46.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Nasty smell of chicken coop: dried guano, some ammonia, and dust, with grain underneath. Happily, it tastes quite a bit better. Sweet grain, snap of rye spice, some dry cocoa powder, but there&#039;s still a dustiness to it, and a distinct small-barrel woodiness. Hard to get past that aroma. Seems like there&#039;s more than one problem here.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
74,Hayes Parker Reserve Cherry,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,13,"Based on the Hayes Parker bourbon. Faint cherry aroma; not sure I’d pick it out without the label’s help. Quite sweet, but still; the cherry character is not so much subtle or faint, as just not there. There is some sweet cherry candy character at the very end. Disappointing.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
74,Canadian Leaf,40.0,Canadian,11,"The loyalty to Canadian Leaf shown by some rye-and-coke drinkers in the Northeastern border states speaks to the broad appeal of whisky in general. With creamy caramel, toffee, sweet burnt sugar, and a pleasant, spice-fired warmth, it makes a great mixing whisky. A certain sharpness and spirity overtones render it less interesting as a sipper. Simple, flawless, and well-executed, but not particularly exciting, this is the light Canadian whisky of yesteryear.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2014
74,Canadian Supreme,40.0,Canadian,9,"One of the Barton whiskies acquired by Sazerac in 2009, Canadian Supreme is a dry, dusty mixer that blossoms in ginger ale. Neat, the nose opens slowly to dried fruit, while the palate is grassy, almost mashy, with butterscotch pudding and a peppery glow. Though not at all tannic, still it becomes a bit pulling in the middle before giving way to prunes, raspberries, and maraschino cherries. The finish is surprisingly long and hot.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2014
74,Jefferson’s Presidential Select 25 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"Its age certainly shows, with a good dose of leather, tobacco, and barrel char. Sweet notes of caramel, toffee, and candied fruit try to rescue it, but ultimately fails toward the finish, leaving my mouth parched, leathery, and craving a glass of water (or a beer!). A bourbon with individuality, but it pains me to think what this could have been (or once was).",John Hansell,Spring 2014
74,Red Stag Spiced with Cinnamon,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Given the Beam house character of cinnamon, I thought this was redundant till I got a whiff of the sweet cinnamon coming off this, like a tea made from Red Hots candies. The drink itself is thickly sweet, and more of the hot cinnamon candy overwhelms anything else; the bourbon is largely lost here. If anything, the finish is even more heavy-handed.  ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
74,Koval Raksi Millet,40.0,White Whiskey,,"A lively light fruitiness (white grapes, green plum) in the nose. Quite grainy, but with an interesting hint of vanilla and a slight saltiness. Finish is a bit astringent, unlike the other Koval spirits. I’m finding these an interesting exercise in distillation, and educational. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
74,Koval Midwest Wheat,40.0,White Whiskey,,"So that’s what wheat smells like: not much. The aromas here seem to be mostly yeast-derived, with a faint ripe fruitiness (undefined: peach, apple?) and alcohol heat, and a touch of wheat-origin sweet grass. Wheat’s in the mouth, like chewing fresh grain with some water and alcohol. It’s all there, and the finish is sweet, and it’s clean, but…that’s about all. White bread whiskey. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
74,Hudson New York Corn Whiskey,46.0,White Whiskey,,"Nose is sweet corn, with some mintiness to it, and some herbal notes; hot, but not off-putting. Tastes are not as sweet as expected. A bit flat, though the sweet corn does come through toward the end. Again, though, this one is quite hot, which is not surprising; the Hudson Baby Bourbons — which this is the foundation for — have struck me as hot also. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
75,McAfee’s Benchmark Old No. 8,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,12,"Freshly cut oak and chewing tobacco to start, followed by hints of green apple, wood chips, and a warm, wet sharpening stone. On the palate, the wood heightens and becomes extremely bitter. This whiskey’s saving grace is that it’s extremely palatable in cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
75,Lambertus 10 year old,40.0,Single Grain Belgian Whisky,57,"This may be the best-known Belgian single grain whisky and it vies for attention with its perfumed nose of violet creams, acetone, and peach juice with ripe mango and papaya. Unfortunately, the body is lacking, yielding up a juicy collision of tropical fruits and icing sugar sweetness, but after that initial arrival, the torpid profile is rather unremarkable. The flavors die quickly, with some residual flavor trails persisting. All in all, a bit drab. €53",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
75,Rebel Yell American Whiskey,45.0,Miscellaneous,30,"A blend of bourbon and rye whiskeys, 2 years old, no information on the proportions. Very hot, piercing nose: wet corn, tobacco juice, peppermint oil, and pain. Man, that’s hot. Bitter and hot on the tongue, with an inappropriate sweetness. Finish backs off on the heat, but is full of wet oak. Can’t help thinking this was simply a bad idea.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
75,Highspire Pure Rye,40.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Made from 100% rye, but aged in wine casks. Distinctly pink tinge: rosé whiskey. Very young nose: rye grain, Starburst candies, and feinty vegetable notes along with the wine-oak. Thin, dry, reminiscent of a dry hay barn: dusty grain, warm wood planks, a bit medicinal. Aged 130 days, and tastes like it. Growing up in Pennsylvania, Highspire was a town we stayed out of. Good advice.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
75,McMenamins Billy Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,35,"An oddball whiskey by all accounts, with a very high 72.2% of wheat in the mashbill, distillation on an old farmhouse cognac still, and aging in a little Oregon barn in 63-gallon new oak barrels. The result is a strange, disjointed whiskey that starts out pillow-soft with wheat and caramel, and then dramatically shifts to raw oak, nougat, and cinnamon stick. The flavors in Billy don’t integrate well: they&#039;re like a jazz band severely out of step.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
75,Hayes Parker Reserve Spice,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,13,"Faint spice aroma becomes more apparent after sitting for 20 minutes; initial pour smelled much like the Reserve Cherry (see below). Christmas cookie spices. Thick and sweet, spice is more evident. Not bad, but pretty thick and not much bourbon flavor for 45%.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
75,Ellington,40.0,Canadian,,"Minnesota is a favored destination for Canadian vacationers from the prairies, and a hotbed for Canadian whisky. The Ellington Whisky Company calls Princeton (Minneapolis) home. Here, it bottles whiskies imported from Canada. Where from, exactly? A trade secret. Caramel, prune juice, ripe yellow fruits, and hints of cooked, buttery corn mute a dry, spirity nose. Peppery and spicy, it blends caramel, bitter lemon soda, sweet ginger, and orange Fanta. Canadian whisky unlike any found in Canada. But do add cola. C$11",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
75,Tullamore Dew Single Malt Sherry Cask Finish,46.0,Irish,,"It's great that Irish whiskey is thriving and William Grant has bought Tullamore Dew. But they need help. To paraphrase English football fans, someone doesn't know what he's doing. The label says this is 12 years old, small batch, and limited edition. What? The normal whiskey is a blend and there's no distillery. So what is this, and why small batch? The whiskey's a mess, too — flabby, characterless, and confused — the whiskey equivalent of a karaoke singer doing Led Zeppelin.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
75,Mackmyra Vit Hund,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"Mackmyra makes no secret of the fact that it borrowed the idea for this release from its American friends. The name means 'white dog,' but the taste is all Scotland. It's sappy, fresh, raw, and vegetal, with some pleasing menthol notes. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it is how much like scotch new make it tastes, suggesting that Swedish barrels have a very big say in the final product. SEK 319",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
75,Knockando 25 year old Special Release 2011,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"What a contrast with the standard bottling. Here we have Knockando in a hugely active cask and, sadly, its fragile character collapses under the assault. The nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax, Turkish tobacco, and maraschino. The palate is dry and tannic, the opposite of what is needed for a whisky that is nutty and dusty in the first place.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
75,Heaven Hill Trybox Series Rye,,White Whiskey,25,"This is new make from the Rittenhouse Rye mashbill, unaged, right off the still. Yeasty mash notes come through strongly, with a big nose of rye and corn underneath. It smells fresh, and alive. Wow, that’s powerful stuff. Much hotter than the Trybox Corn, this one is on fire with rye spice; it’s got me breaking a sweat! A bit of water brings out more grain notes, and some tempering sweetness, but it’s still no pussycat. Cleanly powerful.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
75,Koval Levant Spelt,40.0,White Whiskey,,"Provocative: spelt’s an interesting aroma. Grainy and a bit earthy, with hints of golden delicious apple all combining in the nose. There’s a fast, high flow of creaminess that spreads quickly and disappears, leaving a slightly fruity, grainy aftertaste. Interesting sensations, and again, quite clean. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
75,Stillhouse The Original Moonshine,40.0,White Whiskey,,"Aromas are soft and creamy, with a waft of sweet corn — underlain with a fairly blunt alcohol burn that comes through more as you smell it. Quite sweet on the palate, a wash of green corn, but the flavor isn’t enough to tangle successfully with the fuel, which leads to a tongue-curlingly hot finish. Some definite potential, but it really needs time in a big oak barrel (or some ice and a bottle of Dr. Pepper). ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
76,Sunshine Reserve American whiskey,,American Blended Whiskey,50,"Raw oak, drywall, campfire, and glue open the sinuses. Then, an antiseptic/medicinal property sets in with tobacco, burnt wood, and smoked paprika. Toward the end, a generous helping of vanilla kicks in over a decent finish to save it.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
76,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Organic 6 Grain Whiskey,45.0,Miscellaneous,46,"Youth and rawness offer the first impression, with fresh-cut oak and grains leading the way. The raw grains develop into cooked-oat notes followed by rye toast, tobacco, oak, smoke, and an unwanted bitterness that lingers. The short finish offers a hint of caramel and citrus. Price is per 375 ml.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
76,Rabbit Hole,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"With a mashbill of 70% corn, 10% malted wheat, 10% malted barley, and 10% honey malted barley, youth is evident, as ripe grains and wood initially dominate. Pepper, cherry, and raw clover honey appear mid-palate over wheat bread and creamed corn. A surprisingly medium-to-long finish gives a hint of caramel, suggesting more time in the barrel would create a better pour.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
76,MacNaMara Blended,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"This amber-colored blend from the Gaelic Whisky Company has sweet barley notes and gentle spice aromas. The caramels prop up the dominant flavor of cold-pressed orange oil squeezed from the peel. A crescendo of peppery spice marks the late phase and distinguishes the swallow, before a finish of tangy citrus peel with a touch of clove. Perfectly straightforward blend but limited in scope, like a linear dot-to-dot connecting barley, orange peel, and spice.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
76,St. Augustine Florida Double Cask Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,50,"Aged in a combination of 25-gallon and 53-gallon barrels, Florida’s first bourbon since Prohibition is 16 to 28 months of age. The honor of being first comes with compromises—a youthful, spirited profile, with clear distillate lurking just beneath the heavy surface oak, dried fruit, and cocoa notes. Slightly hot, earthy, and leathery, with Robusta coffee and oak astringency on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
76,Old Charter,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"Named after the Charter Oak tree from the 1800s, this brand offers decent value. Sweetness and grain come and go, with hints of baking soda and dandelions. Think cooked grains, in presentations like cornbread and fresh-baked rye bread. Unfortunately, this is too much of a one-trick pony, falling into those pronounced grains that don’t offer much more. But there’s no doubt about it: it’s worth the money. Remember, value.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
76,Loch Lomond Original,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Since a change of ownership in 2014, the Loch Lomond range has been revamped, with the previous blue and black label single malt variants being dropped in favor of this repackaged NAS expression. Farmyard aromas on the early nose, then emerging malt and caramel. Discreet oak. Rounded on the palate, with immediate citrus fruits, toffee, allspice, and a suggestion of smoke. Spices persist through a slightly citric, cerealy, medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
76,Virgil Kaine High Rye Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Wood tannins are an interesting thing; used correctly, they can help create spice, depth, and complexity, as well as define a spirit&#039;s character. Unrestrained, tannins can wreak havoc. That’s what’s happened with this whiskey. Sharp, unfinished wood defines a nose that is raw in every sense. A thin entry struggles to present maple and caramel before a heavy blast of oak tannins decimates them. Those tannins define the rest of the taste experience, including a sour and bitter finish.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
76,Westland Sherry Wood American Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,70,"With a mash featuring no less than six different kinds of malt and aged in four different barrels (two sherry, a bourbon, and heavy-char new American oak), there are lot of moving parts with this whiskey. A jammy, inviting nose features blackberry jam, raisin, apricot, and ginger. On the palate it’s a cacophonic mess: chocolate and peated malt clash and do battle to grab focus. Add some heavy char and sherry to the mix and it&#039;s a bloodbath.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
76,Navazos-Palazzi Single Palo Cortado Cask,,Spanish Whisky,100,"A non-age statement Spanish malt whisky. Whereas Scotch whisky is often a showcase of the grain, this Spanish malt is all about spotlighting the unique Palo Cortado sherry cask. Monster raisin leads things off and is followed by apricot jam, honey, ginger, and grape blossom. The impact of sherry is so great, it borders on tasting like an interesting young Spanish brandy. A very spicy mid-palate, which is a little hot, drives a very dry finish. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
76,Lovell Bros. Georgia Sour Mash Whiskey,43.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"Light amber color; no age statement, not labeled as “straight whiskey.” Nose of spiced hard candies, wet oak, mint. Very hot mouth, thin body, muddled flavors of candy and wood. Quite young, with a hot, unpleasant finish. The unaged Lovell Bros. is both more enjoyable and more interesting.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
76,K5 Premium Spirit Whisky,40.0,Bhutanese Whisky,50,"From the Land of the Thunder Dragon comes this blend of 8 and 12 year old malts and grain from the Gelephu distillery. It’s clean, light, and fragrant with dried hay notes; like drinking chamomile tea in a tropical greenhouse. The thin flavors show custard tarts, cracker bread, and pencil erasers with a bitter aftertaste of burnt spices. So, not so great as a sipping whisky, but I’ve found it versatile as a base for summer cocktails.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
76,Cinnamon Mist,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,10,"It certainly is cinnamon: got a nose full of it, and not Red Hots, either, this is real cinnamon, just missing the depth of Vietnamese and with, yes, a bit of whisky there. There&#039;s next to no whisky in the mouth, though; this is like a cup of sweet cinnamon tea, something I&#039;d add whisky to. Too sweet, too cinnamon. Where&#039;s the whisky?",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
76,Maple Mist,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,10,"Warm maple, caramel, and salt in the nose, like caramels being melted for making cookies (something my wife does every Christmas). Thin, boozy maple in the mouth. Disappointing, though I suppose it would be good in desserts, or on desserts. But I really expect more whisky, even in a flavored whisky under 40%.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
76,Southern Comfort Bold Black Cherry,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"A medicinal cherry smell, like cough syrup and cherry PEZ, edged with a nutty hint of almonds. Medium-bodied; a slow-flow on the tongue. The cherry doesn’t taste real (like Red Stag’s does), and the SoCo sweetness doesn’t help that. There is a pickup at the end, as the spirit seems to evaporate off the tongue. I can’t help thinking that this should have been a slam-dunk…but they missed.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
76,Knockando 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Since Diageo has included Knockando in its Special Release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling. This is Speyside in its maltiest guise. The nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal: Weetabix and bran flakes, with a whisper of vanilla. The palate is light and dusty, and you get the impression that the malt just wants to scuttle across the tongue and down the throat as quickly as possible. A shy wee mouse of a dram. £30",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
76,Jeremiah Weed Blended Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"A generally sweet palate (a bit too sweet, actually), with vanilla, sweet corn, caramel, marzipan, candied fruit, and a suggestion of red and black licorice, peppered with cinnamon. Slightly harsh on the finish. I wish there was more to balance all the sweetness. (Perhaps some extra aging for some additional dry oak spiciness?)",John Hansell,Spring 2012
76,Red Stag Honey Tea,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"The first thing out of the glass is bourbon — 80 proof bottlings will do that — followed by a secondary note of strong-brewed tea with a dollop of honey. It's quite sweet, and hot, and the tea largely disappears except as a frill around the edges. This is more a honey drink than a tea drink, and there are better honey drinks out there.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
76,Woodstone Creek 5 Grain Bourbon,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"There's a medicinal, darkroom aroma right up front, and a dry graininess (with just a dusting of baker's chocolate) to the nose. It carries through in the mouth, with a faintly chemical astringency that takes away from the underlying corn sweetness. Very hot finish. Water helps bring more sweetness out a bit, but cuts some of the body out from under. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
76,McKenzie Rye Whiskey,,Rye Whiskey,,"Young, but dark; this one's finished in sherry barrels. Peppery, sweet, fruity aromas make it hard to separate the whiskey from the sherry influence. Lots of sherry wood in the mouth, too; oily, waxy, but the whiskey comes through clearly now, with sheaves of rye rolling across the tongue. The sherry is too heavy-handed, it has more presence than it should. Maybe more blending of un-sherried whiskey would work. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
76,Santis Edition Santis,40.0,Swiss,,"The least exciting or distinctive of the Santis range and in some ways the most Germanic and European, with a soft, sweet, and rounded taste that, depending on your point of view, is either flabby and ill-defined, or delightfully soft and cushion-like; the whisky equivalent of eating a milk chocolate bar with a honeycomb center.  €32",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
77,Rabbit Hole PX Sherry Cask Finished,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"It’s 68% corn, 18% wheat, and 14% malted barley finished in a sherry barrel. First there’s an assortment of wood, from tree to toasted oak, followed by roasted walnuts, leather, and marshmallow. Grapefruit rind and a bitterness appear, followed by more woody notes and hints of vanilla. It never strikes the desired balance, finishing short with a hint of hazelnut.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
77,Montgomery American Single Malt 3 year old,45.0,Craft Whiskey,46,"Campfire smoke, fusel notes, green twigs, and <em>rhum agricole</em> give a rustic edge to this big and broad-shouldered whiskey. Full-bodied with an attitude, the sweet clover honey, oily character,  and lingering burnt sugar bitterness feel a bit disjointed. Pot distilled and aged in charred oak for 3 years.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
77,"Great Wagon Road RUA American Single Malt (release 6, batch 10)",40.0,Craft Whiskey,47,"There is a certain rusticity here, with a nose rooted in <i>rhum agricole</i>, sweet malt, honeycomb, butterscotch, and molasses, tinged with furniture polish and varnish notes. The palate is sweet and candied, with Bit-O-Honey, circus peanuts, and nougat, turning a touch chocolatey on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
77,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1990,,Single Grain Whisky,129,"Squished rosehip, nuttiness, and seasoned wood, but there is little else of note on this one. The palate has corn sweetness, red fruits, pomegranate, cherry lips, and descends into soor ploom territory with more oak wood. The finish continues the woody theme with a residual baked apple note.  Port Dundas can be wonderful to drink, but with no shortage of good to great grain whisky on the market, I feel this one is past its best. (258 bottles) £90",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
77,Amador Ten Barrels Straight Hop-Flavored Whiskey,48.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"This literally tastes like pan-fried mushrooms and roots. It’s earthy; you don’t really expect such intensity from a flavored whiskey. After earth, hops, chocolate, and root beer, I finally taste the whiskey; a nearly absent sensation toward the end. But I guess that’s the point: if they wanted you to taste whiskey, they wouldn’t flavor it. Still, there are no chemically-imbalanced flavors here. This is worth trying, even for us curmudgeon purists.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
77,Clansman,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,14,"This Highland blend has a nose of lemon peel, tangerine, and pine-scented kitchen surfaces. The whisky is young, with a sweet mandarin dressing over the grain character, barley sugars, and a gentle rumble of spice. What it lacks at this age is mouthfeel, structure, and wood influence. The finish continues the sugared orange theme, with spice and ground pepper fading to soor plooms. For what can be expected at this age, the Clansman does its job well.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
77,Texas Crown Club,40.0,Canadian,20,"Porridge, butterscotch, and a little dust on the nose. Rosewater and some spice on the palate, but the floral notes are out of balance. Hot peppers, slightly pulling, and a bit mealy on the tongue, then a pleasing earthiness. The label says “ultra premium,” the taste says “not so much.” The best feature is the pepper, which will bolster ginger ale and cut through cola because this is not really for sipping.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
77,Palmetto Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,30,"Palmetto distillery has been making ‘moonshine’ products so far, and now they have some spirit aged in new French oak. Aromas of sweet pastry dough, new rubber, horehound, and bitter orange make for an intriguing nose. The mouth is fiery hot, thin in body, and tends to stay that way through to the end. The horehound blends with rye bitterness to make this a bit medicinal. Hot for sipping, but should make a very good Old Fashioned.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
77,Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Screaming oak nose for a relatively young whiskey; about all that’s there is whiskey-soaked staves and some hot spice. Drillingly-hot entry; I’ve tasted bourbons at 60% that were less hot. Roaring oak fire with some underlying corn sweetness; this isn’t subtle or quiet on the tongue. Water brings out more—sweet corn, mint, rye oil—but the oak still dominates. Almost astringent in the finish. If you like big oak, here it is, but forget balance.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
77,Wild Weasel Finest Blend,40.0,Blended Belgian Whisky,44,"They blended Wild Weasel single malt with whisky from the Radermacher distillery (maker of Lambertus grain whisky) to create the world’s first blended Belgian whisky. It noses young, with straw, digestive biscuits, damp woodlands, oat breakfast cereals, and a hint of spice saving it from nosing like a crisp Sauvignon Blanc. The mouthfeel is languorous, with a musty texture, some grapefruit acidity, tangerine sweetness, and a mild, malty finish. So now we know. €40",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
77,The Lost Distillery Company Auchnagie (batch 2/1),46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,65,"Auchnagie (1812–1911) was a southern Highland distillery that existed for close to a century near Balluinluig, south of Pitlochry. This reanimation is pale yellow in color with an abundance of young, green herbal, and foliage notes, with summer ferns, cardamom pods, and green tea. It has an ethereal, gossamer-like texture, with green apple, melon boats, and soft honey. As the layers peel away, the sweetness is dabbed with spices and black pepper before it peters out.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
77,Two James Johnny Smoking Gun (batch 3),,Craft Whiskey,49,"“Smoked” with a maceration of Lapsang Souchong tea (which leaves some fine sediment). Thickly sweet and herbal nose in a ruddy whiskey; like a sweetened, aged genever. On the palate, this 70% 7 year old MGP corn, 30% unaged Two James rye is woody and ash-bitter in the core, with a wrapping of that sweetness. The herbal character saves it from the squabble between sweet and bitter, but it comes off more as a tonic than a whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
77,Hudson Valley Distillers Chancellor’s Raw Bourbon,40.0,Craft Whiskey,30,"Aged one day in new American oak, this white dog ekes out the very minimum requirements for bourbon. The nose is heavy barnyard, complete with hay, horse, and manure. Beyond the funk is cornmeal, cashew, and apple blossom. The palate is light and what you&#039;d expect, with yeasty cornbread, sour apple, apple blossom, and black pepper. The funk is still there but not as intense as on the nose. Interesting overall character with aging potential, but for now it’s unbaked.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
77,Sons of Liberty Hop Flavored Whiskey,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,49,"Lemony, pine woods, even some seashore aromas over the sweetness of the malt whiskey underneath. Not overly bitter, more whiskey-sweet, and the aromas are subdued in the mouth. I like a big hoppy IPA, but this isn’t setting my palate. I think it’s missing the body of a beer. I have yet to have a hopped whiskey that I really like; this isn’t it either.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
77,Master of Malt Reference Series I,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,62,"A predominantly young blended malt heads up the first of the Reference Series, designed as an educational tool to help attune your palate. It’s a light, floral array, with waxed lemons, oatcakes, and peppermint. Mouthfeel is thin with little structure, heavy on the barley, with hints of boiled fruit candies. Sipped neat, it’s drying, with doughy notes and dried apple. Water fails to enliven the experience, other than showing late lemon and icing sugar. Memorize it, and move up. £37",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
77,Grand Macnish 150th Anniversary Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,18,"Robert McNish conceived his recipe for a lighter style of Highland whisky in Glasgow in 1863 (though the brand added an ‘a’ to his surname for easier pronunciation). Whole orange, ground hazelnut, and ground ginger on the nose, though it keeps pretty tight-lipped. Light and sweet in the mouth, with mandarin and more pronounced ginger mid-palate before a medium-length finish of bubblegum and gooseberry. It just seems a little uninspiring given the special occasion.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
77,H5 Iced Single Grain,40.0,Single Grain Whisky,22,"Boldly, this is naturally colored (barely colored) 3 year old grain whisky presented in a tall, clear bottle. The predominant aroma of corn husks is mixed with a sentimental schoolroom whiff of white glue peeled from the fingertips. There’s wheat cracker, bread, cooked ham, dripping foliage, and chopped parsley. A clean, refreshing mouthfeel with pleasant marshmallow sweetness is nixed by flavors of corn, sliced bread, and vanilla, but they are hastily extinguished. A finishing spicy glimmer shuts down quickly too.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
77,Southern Shine Original Moonshine,40.0,Craft Whiskey,15,"Although this moonshine may look down-home in a mason jar, it was produced using the highly technical TerrePure process, designed to remove most congeners. The result is a corn neutral spirit that doesn’t smell or taste much like corn. Instead, it’s soft vanilla, toasted marshmallow, and a dash of salt. A little heat and white pepper round things out for a long, peppery-dry finish. It’s pretty good for a vodka, but is it really moonshine or white whiskey? Probably not.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
77,Hayes Parker Reserve Original,45.0,Craft Whiskey,12,"From TerrePure; there’s that reassuring note on the label that the whiskey is “Aged at least six months.” Nose is somewhat flat, compressed; diner mints, old cinnamon sticks, cattle feed. Tastes thin, sweet, hot, and not very complex. There’s a flash of something more just before the swallow: corn, hot mint. But it vanishes in a bland, quick finish. Uninspiring, if surprisingly smooth for 6 month old whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
77,Catoctin Creek Roundstone Rye Batch B12E2,58.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"Single barrel, cask proof. Strong wood aromas; pencil shavings, hot-sawn oak. Hot and tight, intense wood. There’s some interesting stuff around the edges, but the wood’s blocking it till some sweetness peeks through at the end. Water helps a little, but not enough. Over-barreled.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
77,Arizona Distilling Desert Durum Wheat,46.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Extremely dark color; aged in ten-gallon barrels. A thick burbling nose, full of dark aromas: smoke, molasses, earth, and moist tobacco, with a sharp woody twist around the outside. The mouth recapitulates much of that, but in a brighter fashion…and then the small barrel takes over; tight, intense wood that blows out everything else and leaves the tongue tingling. I find it hard to tease out any spirit character; what’s this whiskey taste like under the wood?",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
77,Wild Turkey Spiced,43.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,23,"An odd roaring noseful of spices: vanilla, pepper, ginger, teaberry. Tastes perfumey first, then resolves to sweet vanilla, hot oak, and more teaberry. Can’t decide if it wants to be bourbon—it’s hot, and flexing oak—or candy, and does a poor job at both; it’s like a linebacker in a French maid’s outfit, just wrong. There are much better sweet, spicy whiskey mixes out there; the original Spicebox comes to mind.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
77,The One,40.0,English Blended Whisky,50,"Lakes distillery will become the fifth English whisky producer when it starts distilling this year. That puts England on the whisky map. Before then, though, this is its first bottling: a blend of British whiskies, though I&#039;m not sure what that means exactly. The nose is fine, but on the palate it&#039;s like skiing on end-of-season snow: you get to ski, but it&#039;s a thin, wet, and not totally comfortable ride. England expects…better. £30<b>

</b>",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
77,Centennial Spiced,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,28,"Sweet, heavy vanilla, powdered sugar, and dog-toothed spring violets, it smells very light with soft hints of sweet floral perfume. What begins as viscous and creamy on the tongue suddenly becomes refreshingly bitter and loaded with hot, singeing spices. Pepper and dried candied orange peel linger while the sweetness dims. A pleasing bitter finish fades into a warm glow. Although the whisky struggles at first, it breaks through in the middle with its spices and heat. <i>(Canada only) </i>C$31",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
77,Chicken Cock Root Beer Flavored Whiskey,43.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,20,"Root beer (wintergreen, sugar, a bit of cinnamon) and oak on the nose; whiskey/oak predominates. There’s actually a lot of whiskey flavor here, too, though it’s not great whiskey, the finish gets sweet and clingy, and the mix seems forced. Still…root beer-flavored whiskey? In an aluminum bottle? Why not just buy some whiskey and put it in your root beer? Then when you come to your senses, you can drink the whiskey like a civilized human.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
77,Black Eagle Honey,35.0,American Blended Whiskey,12,"Odd aroma, more like a weedy, aromatic bark than honey; wonder what the bees were gathering from? Very sweet, on the rich and cloying side, but without the real honey character that makes Jack Daniel’s Honey the best of this bunch, and I can’t get over the aroma. The only saving grace is that even at 35%, the bourbon still manages to peek through; it’s not enough.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
77,Amherst Gate,40.0,Canadian,,"Rum—“screech,” as it is called where it is made—is Newfoundland’s spirit of choice. With three shots of screech and a ceremony involving fish, visitors are transformed into honorary Newfies. This 3 year old Amherst whisky, custom blended for the Newfoundland Liquor Commission, is ancient by comparison. It’s a basic mixer that arrives peppery hot with strong overtones of half-tamed spirit. Dusty wood, lime peels, and burnt toffee foretell a leisurely slide into refreshing bitterness. Definitely not screech. <i>(Newfoundland only) </i> C$25",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
77,Canadian Club Reserve 9 year old Triple Aged,40.0,Canadian,,"The discontinued 10 year old CC Reserve was typical of the hard-rye genre, with vanilla, caramel, ripe fruit, and hot pepper stitched onto a flinty-firm base. This new 9 year old version, though similar, has obvious differences. Pleasing heat rides an initial surge of toffee, dry grain, and dried dark fruit. A soon-to-arrive pithiness on the shortish finish refreshes, but without the familiar steeliness of its antecedent. ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
77,New England Corn Whiskey,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Berkshire Mountain Distillers uses locally grown corn here, aged on local oak and cherry wood. The nose is sweet and sharp, smelling of corn, grass, and tart cherries. Corn and ash dominate the hot, slippery mouth, with a finish that turns sweeter as it dwindles, with some faint fruit notes, but the heat is hard to overcome. If it were my corn, I’d put it into the bourbon instead; this is a bit thin. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
77,Whistling Andy’s Moonshine,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"There’s a somewhat oily, faint green look to this in the bottle. Strong aroma of corn, some green apple, and a faint hint of smoke and wet dog. Tastes a bit medicinal with a smoky richness and a surprisingly full mouthfeel. Sweet finish adds to the general impression that this one needs cleaned up a bit…or demands a different approach.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
77,Glenrothes 1996 Editor’s Cask #9973,57.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The second of the duo — destined for the U.S. and Taiwan — is a relative youngster and has been extracted from a fresh Spanish oak sherry hogshead. The combination of first-fill and smaller cask size is immediately apparent. The color is mocha dark and the nose has a distinctly sulfurous twist, behind which are black cherries dipped in chocolate, tonka bean, and leather. For me, there’s too much cask and not sufficient Rothes complexities, especially on the palate.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
77,High West Silver Western Oat,40.0,White Whiskey,33,"Barely-aged white whiskey. Light, sharp fruit (brighter than the High West Single Malt), a brittle sweetness, new-make greenness. Quite smooth, even a bit creamy, with a light float of vanilla and a hit of grain in the middle. It all wafts away on a razor-edged cloud of a finish. Smooth for a white, but I&#039;d like more substance.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
77,Hellyers Road Original Pure,,Australian Whisky,123,"Hellyers Road is Tasmania&#039;s biggest distillery, formed by dairy producers who feared the island&#039;s dairy business was under threat from mainland producers and needed a fallback policy. Early bottlings were dreadful, but this is a big step forward. It&#039;s still an acquired taste, though, with rootsy, vegetal, and grassy Scottish Lowland elements. It&#039;s saved by a cocoa powder, mint chocolate, and puff pastry heart.  $AUS 120",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
77,Finger Lakes Glen Thunder Corn Whiskey,45.0,White Whiskey,22,"Crisps the nose hairs a bit, but it’s pure corn, even a bit of cornbread. Tip a sip in, and it’s nothing but more green corn, sweet, fresh — hot, for sure, but not overwhelming — and pretty tasty for what it is. With white whiskey, we’re walking the fine line between flavor and raw wound at all times, and this one finds the line.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
77,Koval Rye Chicago,40.0,White Whiskey,,"Smelling the rye from a foot away after pouring. Exceptionally clean aroma of grain; the oily/spicy rye notes come through clearly. Quite smooth. Not a lot of flavors: very focused on the rye itself, with grain and just a touch of mint. A long finish with sweet grain that slowly turns to mint in the end. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
77,Old Hobart Overeem Port Cask,55.0,Australian Whisky,,"This is matured in 100 liter casks, and the port is all over the youthful spirit. But while the combination leaves a lot to be desired, and there are all sorts of youthful errors on show, the fruity, rich, and creamy core of this malt suggests that we’re looking at the stirring of a giant. Bottled this fall at 4 years, this is a holding tank. What follows will be immense. AUD180 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
77,Canadian Club 100 Proof Export Strength,50.0,Canadian,,"Hot solvents on the nose, reminiscent of Hinkle’s Easter egg dyes. Heavy-handed sweet wash of caramel, very hot, cloying finish. Not easy to see this as related to the clean innocence of the standard expression.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
77,Cragganmore 21 year old,56.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The lightness of the hue suggests a very slow maturation in refill casks, and while I tried hard to get to grips with this, I found the nose simply too discreet. There’s a hint of the burning bonfire which indicates the subtle smoke that underpins Cragganmore; there’s even some parma violet, dried berries, and a hint of sulfur.

The palate picks things up a little, showing ferns, wet moss, Oolong tea, and dried apple, as well as citrus and — surprisingly — some just-lit cigar fuminess. It’s all rather understated, however. This is one of my top distilleries, but compared to the recent Special Releases and magnificent Friends of the Classic Malts bottlings, this is slightly underwhelming. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
78,Jameson Lively,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,38,"Explore the grain side of Jameson’s personality in this first specimen from the Deconstructed series. Expect floral aromatics and a mixed crate of fresh citrus fruit, so it smells closer to the airport’s perfume counter than the whiskey store. Strands of honey, squeezed citrus, and vanilla blossom amid a thickening mouthfeel after a feather-light beginning. It’s tooth-achingly sweet, but daubed with lime and sweet clementine, leading to a dry, warm finish with chalky candy. (<i>Travel Retail exclusive</i>) €36",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
78,Parker’s Heritage (distilled Fall 1990) 24 year old,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,250,"Non-chill filtered plus a lot of age equals oak meeting caramel, vanilla, earth, nuttiness, and mildew. Slight hints of anise, rose petals, tree bark, and overcooked rice, before over-oaked flavor dominates with medicinal notes and soap. Bitterness, earth, and a saving grace of herbs follow for a decent, albeit woody finish. This is simply over-oaked. I’d love to have tasted this bottled three to seven years ago.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
78,MacNaMara Rum Cask Finish,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,37,"Meaning “son of the sea,” this MacNaMara has a lilting sweetness that lifts from the glass, the characteristic orange-peel oil note is present, but less assertive. Nectarine, Murray mints, and antique shop mustiness, but a lot less aromatic than many of its contemporaries. Flavors of sweet melon, golden honey, and tangy orange take off in the mouth, with tastes of white pepper, fennel, and ground ginger in hot pursuit. Pepperiness penetrates an otherwise juicy finish.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
78,Yamazakura 16 year old,40.0,Japanese,138,"Age statements are disappearing from Japanese whiskies, but this 80% grain content blended whisky from Sasanokawa Shuzo is evidence that age is no substitute for flavor. A tight nose of lychee, white pepper, allspice, and toasted oats is bettered by a sweet, light profile, yielding American oak characteristics of vanilla and creamed coconut. It’s quickly dominated by intensely spicy seasoning overcoming late notes of burnt orange, fresh fig, and sour grapefruit peel before a finish of peppered mackerel. (1,992 bottles, <i>Europe only</i>) €130",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
78,Tullamore D.E.W. Cider Cask Finish,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,61,"Hands up if you’d ever wondered what would happen if you seasoned old bourbon barrels with fermenting Irish cider, then added a triple blend of whiskeys? Anyone? Fizzy sherbet, green foliage, and cider (not apple) notes, that’s what. Seasoning suggests the cask occupants are less than good mates, the cider more a lingering tenant. Pot still surfaces through the saccharine cider flavors, with coiled Bramley apple peels, citrus strands, and a nippy spiciness. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. €54",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
78,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 10 year old 2005,,Single Grain Whisky,57,"One might speculate about the initial qualities of this young grain prior to its sherry cask finish. While it boasts a richer color, the nose is reminiscent of roast beef, plasticine, wet dog, and bruised raspberries. In the mouth, it has good weight, though mouth puckering, with some brief rubbery notes early on before showing strawberry bubblegum, sugar crystals, black cherry, rhubarb, faint coffee notes, and an ever-growing pepperiness. An enjoyable finish of baked apple and star anise. (727 bottles) £44",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
78,Boondocks 11 year old Cask Strength,,American Whiskey (Unspecified),60,"There’s promise here, with peach, dried apricot, baking spice, and vanilla delighting the olfactory, and a slight hint of coffee just in case you needed it. But the intense heat shows itself and grain covers subtle sweetness and spice. The best high-proof whiskeys are actually quite smooth; this needs water to find its sweet spot. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
78,Mellow Corn Bottled in Bond,50.0,Straight Corn Whiskey,13,"Used cooperage and higher corn content make corn whiskey its own category, and Mellow Corn is its leader. As expected, corn dominates throughout as salty chip, tortilla, and my favorite, a thick corn pudding. Burnt brown sugar, vanilla, and black pepper spice tingle the senses, too. This is a sipper if you really like corn, but you can’t drink this and think bourbon.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
78,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (Batch 2),,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,144,"Caramel wafers, white pepper, pumice stone, and strands of caramel on the nose, but this is not a whisky bursting with personality. A sip brings cocoa and chocolate flavors which meld into an herb garden bouquet. A thin mouthfeel and rather linear flavor development make this seem rather ordinary, not a word I normally associate with this idiosyncratic range. The finish is redolent of marble cake. Not a patch on the superb Batch 1 in my book. (415 bottles) £100",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
78,Raasay While We Wait,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"This bottling from an unspecified Highland distillery is intended to represent the style of whisky to be produced in the Raasay distillery, currently under construction.  Peated to a level of 15ppm, this expression has been finished in Tuscan red wine casks.  4,000 bottles are available. Buttery farmyard aromas, with red berries and a sense of relative youth.  Silky on the palate, with intense fruit sweetness and an immediate delivery of very spicy peat. Pepper and peat in a medium-length finish. £55",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
78,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British; batch 2),,Grain Scotch Whisky,95,"<em>Papier mâché</em>, adhesives, lemongrass, green cardamom, peanut, pear, and other aromatic, fruity characteristics create a puzzling aroma profile. On sipping, there is fruity baked apple, sherbet, and glowing light citrus notes of orange, grapefruit, and lime, with a medium weight structure. The flavors tip toward a slight sour fruit note, but as this flattens out, creaminess rules. The finish suffers a short, quick death, leaving mild, sour fruit. Water brings crystallized lemon on the nose and sweeter, light fruits. £63",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
78,Hunter Rye,45.0,Canadian,11,"A version of the classic Canadian Hunter from Sazerac, this is a very enjoyable whisky for sipping on ice or with a simple mixer. A dry nose is a bit closed showing soft spirit, caramel, and hints of maple. The sweet, hot, and slightly pulling palate has a grapefruit juice sharpness that keeps it fresh. Maple syrup sweetens a hot, longish finish that has the feel of black licorice. Simple, fun whisky.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
78,Highwood True North,40.0,Canadian,22,"A simple, straightforward session whisky. True North is rich in the classic caramel notes and searing pepper so coveted by shooters and tailgaters. Ginger and white pepper last seemingly forever. Given its undeniable drinkability, packaging in a plastic bottle is probably a good idea. You can sip this if you wish, but with ginger ale and a dash of bitters it becomes a Canadian Saturday night in a glass. A classic Canadian bottom-shelfer. <em>(Canada only)</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
78,Westland Peated American Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,70,"This young peated malt, aged at least 24 months, has a nice, dry peat smoke nose, backed by honey and oak. On the palate it’s disjointed: the young peat malt argues with the heavy char barrel, a struggle that needs more time to be worked out. Honeyed malt tries to lend support but everything topples in the mid-palate, where things turn dry, spicy, and slightly acidic. A medium finish wraps up a whiskey that simply needs more time.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
78,Swift Single Malt Texas Whiskey,43.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Pale gold in color, this whiskey is noticeably cloudy, even in a warm room. Swift&#039;s nose is pleasant, with malt, honey, and butterscotch. The entry is exceptionally thin, with a hint of malt and honey, but there&#039;s not much to it. In the mid-palate, it’s all about the bourbon barrel, so much so that the overall character shifts toward corn whiskey. A short finish with chocolate notes wraps up a whiskey that just doesn’t have much to say.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
78,Hell-Cat Maggie,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,20,"Look out! This new Irish blend is named after the razor-nailed, sharp-toothed hoodlum who gained notoriety with the Dead Rabbits fighting gang. The nose comprises whole orange peel, boiled sugar, and dried peach pits. Sherbet, fruit polos, apple, baked almond slice, and digestive biscuit make for a sweet palate. For real street cred, Maggie needs more backbone: the thin mouthfeel needs more weight and structure. The finish is precipitously swift. Rather ordinary, though I wouldn’t tell Maggie to her face.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
78,Big Bottom Barlow Trail Port Cask Finish,,Craft Whiskey,38,"Big Bottom finishes their light-style Barlow Trail whiskey in 10 year old tawny port casks. On the nose it&#039;s promising, with oak, blackberry jam, orange, vanilla, and rye spice. The entry is soft and light with vanilla and berry, but it shifts dramatically in the mid-palate, which is exceptionally spicy and dry. Big Bottom’s previous port cask finishes have been blockbusters, but the light-style Barlow Trail whiskey doesn&#039;t have the same level of balance and integration to prevail.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
78,Penderyn Legend,41.0,Welsh Whisky,47,"This edition was matured in bourbon but finished in Madeira casks, which lends it a honeyed, sweet nose of cream soda, lychee, whole almond, and dried tropical fruit. Smartly, the finishing cask gives a lift but never dominates. A fresh, clean taste, but the mouthfeel has a frailty, so although you will find lemon, icing sugar, candy bananas, and molten honey, this doesn’t quite live up to its rousing name. £31",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
78,Kilchoman Single Cask Sherry Cask (Cask #85),,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Distilled at the start of 2009, this special edition was bottled mid-2014, making it a 5 ½ year old whisky. The nose is ashy paste with a good measure of barnyard funk along with sherry, oak, and clove spice. The entry is all ashtray, a late night of sweet wine and cigarettes. Sherry notes fight the smoke to emerge, but the smoke simply dominates. A smoky, ashy, spicy, and dry finish round out a face-slapper of a whisky. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
78,Wigle Whim Hint of Hop,46.0,Craft Whiskey,34,"Like the Whim Mocha Porter, this is certified organic; a wheat whiskey made with locally-grown hops. Hard to tease out hops vs. small barrel oak spice in the nose; it’s bold and shouty. Wow. The hops are explosive in the mouth, flashing bitter on the tongue. The first sip was shocking, now it’s settling in, and becoming smoother, but I just don’t think this much hops is a good idea in a whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
78,"Adirondack Distilling 1,000 Stills White Whisky",40.0,Craft Whiskey,33,"Buttered popcorn combines with wet pavement, vanilla, and black pepper for an interesting but edgy nose. The entry is light and sweet with vanilla and buttered corn, and a silky smooth mouthfeel. The mid-palate thins things out a bit and shifts focus to strong black pepper. This black pepper drives a spicy and dry finish. Many white whiskies straddle the line between whisky and vodka, and this one edges a little too close to the vodka space.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
78,West Cork Single Malt Whiskey Aged 10 Years,40.0,Irish,40,"As the enterprising fellows at West Cork Distillers only built the place in 2007, this 10 year old must be sourced elsewhere. A decent nose with vanilla cupcakes fresh from the oven, dull lemon notes, tablet, and faint spices. It has a limited range, let down by a narrow flavor profile; acidic, lemony sharpness with a light mouthfeel. The sharpness strong-arms the sugariness for 30 seconds until toffee notes break through. An acerbic lemon bonbon in liquid form.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
78,Prichard&#039;s Double Chocolate Bourbon,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,65,"Prichard’s Double Barreled Bourbon is flavored with artisan chocolate. This dark chocolate is clear on the nose but not singular, as it&#039;s accompanied by strong oak, maple syrup, and cherry. On the palate, chocolate becomes more a supporting flavor for classic bourbon notes of oak, maple, caramel, and clove spice. The mid-palate is a little acidic and the chocolate adds a slight bitterness to the equation. The finish is a little too dry, but in all, an intriguing combination of flavors.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
78,Highland Queen,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,20,"The range begins with this entry-level whisky, aged for 3 years. Aromas of pale toffee, vanilla, and scented, herbaceous notes can be found on the nose. It has a light, silky texture and comprises flavors of stewed fruits, with a slight bitterness behind them. Plum and coffee notes expand, though it remains tart through to the buzzy finish, which is lifted by hints of chocolate. A robust and pugnacious dram.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
78,Hatfield & McCoy,40.0,Craft Whiskey,39,"Caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, generic sweetness. Smooth entry, and more of the same on the tongue with some alcohol heat in the finish. Very little wood at all. Begging to be poured into Coke. Maybe most jarring is that the Hatfield &amp; McCoy “brand” recalls the infamous feud that took place on the Kentucky-West Virginia border…while this was distilled in South Carolina. At least the label’s honest as far as that. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
78,Quincy Street Bourbon Spring,44.0,Craft Whiskey,32,"Plainly states it’s “aged four months in a small oak barrel.” Tame nose; working hard to pull out anything other than alcohol heat, some fresh-cut wet wood, and wet cereal. Quite hot, with lots of wet oak sawdust and sweet cinnamon that rocket right into the finish. Reminds me of a young teenager, running around, shouting at inappropriate moments, and very excited. Too young and hot right now. Put it back in the barrel; maybe a larger one. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
78,The Maltman (distilled at Linkwood) 18 year old Port Finish,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,119,"Light onionskin color; the nose is scented with red fruits, cranberry sauce, hawthorn jelly, and red apple. With water there’s some bletted medlars mixed with lemon. Sadly, the palate is soapy to start with, before the super-ripe red fruits come through. Water makes things fresher, but overall it lacks personality.",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
78,Girvan No. 4 Apps,42.0,Single Grain Whisky,76,"The entry level official Girvan is named after their ‘MPS’ distillation apparatus that distills at various pressures and under vacuum to vaporize and distill at lower temperatures. This is very light, with fresh whole pineapples, orange fondant creams, delicate vanilla, and risen dough. It’s fiendishly sweet (have a dental hygienist on standby), like a deep layer of butter frosting, sticky cotton candy, honey, overripe bananas, and spearmint. The expeditious finish tenders cookie mix, digestive biscuits, and a grind of pepper. £45",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
78,Spey Royal Choice,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,250,"Hailing from the Speyside distillery, this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle. A perception of bitterness beside dried peels. The palate is thick with stewing fruits, tinned prune, and burnt sugar, with a background note of wet draff. Water lifts things a little, but it&#039;s all rather sick and flabby. £150",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
78,Southern Shine Apple Pie Moonshine,50.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,16,"Even though it has more alcohol than Southern Shine’s straight ‘moonshine,’ the nose is fairly evasive, with subtle cinnamon apple. The entry is much sweeter than expected, with caramel, cinnamon, and apple, but manages to be well-balanced by the base spirit, which adds pepper spice and enhances the cinnamon. The apple notes flirt with artificiality but end up reading as dried apple. The finish is long and maintains the cinnamon-apple spice well, but is a tad hot.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
78,American Born Moonshine Original,,Craft Whiskey,25,"Lots of green notes in the nose of this mason jar variety of moonshine, including green apple, green bean, and wheat grass. Strong brewer’s yeast and cornmeal round things out in a highly aromatic nose. For the proof, the entry is remarkably soft and sweet, tasting like buttered cornbread. Fire and spice aren’t far behind, with black pepper, white pepper, and charred Cracker Jack. Long, dry, and slightly hot finish with a hint of popcorn and green bean.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
78,Red Fife Batch 1,50.0,Canadian,37,"The heritage grains movement influenced distiller Jesse Razaqpur at Toronto distillery to make whisky from an old-time Ontario variety called Red Fife. This hard red wheat contains less starch than the traditional soft wheat used for whisky making, yielding less spirit. Red Fife wheat also contains flavor-inducing anthocyanins, similar to red-grape flavenoids. Distinctive grain dust and slate-like mineral notes dominate the nose, translating into searing hot pepper, ripe red fruit, and a slight sourness on the palate. (<em>Distillery only) </em>C$40/375 ml.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
78,Ron Burgundy “Great Odin’s Raven” Special Reserve,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"What does this say about how far whisky has come? We live in an era where you can now buy the official whisky from a major motion picture. This has a deep amber color. <i>Really</i> deep. The nose brings warm muffins, caramel, and grassy notes with a good dose of smoke. It’s a sweet concoction with a peppery kick. There’s a tinge of polypropylene before a short, clipped, spicy finish. It just needs to find more of its own identity.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
78,Last Mountain,40.0,Canadian,33,"While their home-distilled whisky matures, some dedicated craft whisky makers hone their blending skills using sourced whiskies to create blends such as this one. Caramel heated to the point of burning, and oily, freshly-roasted coffee with hints of real maple syrup gloriously overtake a spirity nose that betrays the youth of this simple, no age statement work in progress. Scrumptious elements of clean oak, burned lumber, sawdust, and earthy pineyness are beguiling, but would benefit from tighter balance. (<i>Saskatchewan only.) </i>C$33",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
78,Inchmurrin 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,77,"Inchmurrin is one of many single malts produced by Loch Lomond. It is made using lightly peated malt and matured in bourbon casks, and is named after one of the islands in Loch Lomond. Caramac chocolate and peanut butter on the sweet, fruity nose. The fruit motif continues on to the palate, where spicy malt, vanilla, and ripe peaches predominate. The finish is medium in length and nutty. £50",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
78,Yellow Rose Outlaw Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Small barrel whiskey, 100&#37; corn. Rich, sweet, oaky nose with—at first—notes of peppermint and Rice Krispies treats; nose collapses and becomes sharp, woody, burnt. Fiery mouth, smoky notes, dry wood, and hot mint are overwhelming and somewhat astringent. Finish lingers much longer than would be pleasant; hot and tingly, with a redeeming core of corn. Tastes like it was pushed, hard, to be done.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
78,Schenley Golden Wedding,40.0,Canadian,,"Prior to Prohibition, Golden Wedding was a fine American whiskey. Decades later, entrepreneur Louis Rosenstiel successfully revived the brand in Canada. The result shows hints of burnt toffee, dusty rye, dry grain, and pickle juice. Earthy elements underscore river plants and citrus pith. Hot, peppery spices bolster lively spirits while jammy fruit and floral overtones round out a straight-on mixer. A whisky that transforms ginger ale into ginger ale. (Canada only)C$24",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
78,White Owl Spiced Whisky,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"A subtle essence of vanilla and restrained crispy oak are lathered in rich butterscotch, then seasoned with scorching pepper and a pinch of rye spices. Surprisingly, it’s not overly sweet. Smooth creamy custard coats your mouth, mellowing otherwise assertive spices. The dram finishes in pulling citrus pith with touches of peppery heat, tingling ginger and cloves, and fading hints of ripe cherries. Faint but distinct whiffs of barrels remind us that this colorless liquid is whisky. (Alberta only) C$40",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
78,Short Mountain Shine,,Craft Whiskey,,"Does this belong here, at 70% cane sugar and 30% corn/wheat? The process sure looks like whiskey, so we’ll let it slip in. The aroma’s sweet, but with a solvent rim to it. For 105 proof, this is pretty smooth stuff in the mouth. There are notes of melon and green corn, and a wet hint of fresh grass before the burner kicks on at the finish. It’s a hot end on this one, but not unpleasant. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
78,Copper Fox Rye Spirit,62.0,Craft Whiskey,,"New make fruit—pear, stewed apple—and rye spice in a hot, clean nose. That’s pretty much what you get in the mouth, too, with some dry paper notes, and a sweet finish. For some reason, I really want to try mixing this with Dr. Pepper. This is definitely a mixing spirit, mountain-style.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
78,Seagram’s 7 Crown,40.0,American Blended Whiskey,,"“75&#37; Grain Spirits.” Let’s get that right out there! Slight rose cast to the liquid, and a smell of caramel and brown sugar. Thin, with a hot finish, but drinkable. Honestly, while this is not something I’d even shoot with a beer chaser, it’s hardly flawed; this is clean and makes a decent mixer.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
78,Duncan Taylor Rare Auld (distilled at Glen Moray) 1986 24 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Touches of acetone and magic marker/solvent suggest that there’s precious little cask involvement going on here. Pleasing enough, with lime jelly and kiwi fruits, and a little whiff of sweet oak, but it’s very understated. In the mouth, it performs in a nutty way but doesn’t seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration. There is some horchata and brazil nut, even a mashy note, but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving. £70",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
78,Redemption High Rye Bourbon (Batch 1),46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Aged “over 2 years” and with over 38% rye in the mashbill (high for bourbon). It’s fresh, youthful, and brisk, with sweet corn, bright fruit, brittle mint, cinnamon, and a dusting of cocoa, leading to a slightly aggressive finish. A bit too youthful, actually, for sipping—it would benefit from a few more years’ aging. Save this one for your next Manhattan. Its sibling, Redemption Rye (of similar age), fares better (84).",John Hansell,Fall 2011
78,Kaiapoi 13 year old,40.0,New Zealand,,"Kaiapoi is a small town in North Canterbury, New Zealand, and was in the frontline of the recent horrific earthquake that wrecked this pretty part of the south island. Made by distiller John Fitzgerald and matured for 13 years, this whisky has been something of a secret. It tastes like nothing else on earth. It’s like Germany’s Blaue Maus — working off a different template than scotch. Imagine sweet alcoholic hazelnuts giving way to spice. Lacks depth, though. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
78,DYC 10th Anniversary single malt,40.0,Spanish Whisky,,"Made entirely with Spanish barley and showing healthy progress, this 10 year old single malt is further proof that owner Beam Global is committed to producing quality Spanish single malt. But it has some way to go. This is a señorita, not a matador, and is far too polite — more like a blend than a single malt. Orange jelly, marzipan, and apple pip all make an appearance, but it’s all too safe. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
79,Barrell Rye (Batch 002),,Rye Whiskey,90,"Oak comes out strong and dominates. Its astringency appears to mask everything else for a moment, just before tobacco, dark chocolate, peanut butter, and sesame seeds set in. Unfortunately, these notes surface only briefly before the oak barrage reappears. It’s simply over-oaked.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
79,O.Z. Tyler Rye,,Rye Whiskey,23,"Aromas of lumber, wood spice, and butterscotch give way to pencil shavings, toasted sawdust, and cloying sweetness on the palate. Gentle baking spice and cherry flavors aren’t enough to redeem the assault of wood.

Processing: Distilled in Kentucky and aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing the TerrePURE process.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
79,Dry Fly Straight Bourbon 101,,Craft Whiskey,60,"Lots of char and burnt sugar on the nose, leading to some sweet fruit on the palate, with coffee and mocha on the finish. Vanilla cream candies are overwhelmed by a woodpile of oak, drying tannins, and heat that lack balance. Multiple tastings with consistent results.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
79,Reservoir Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,85,"Aromas hint at a bitterly astringent, almost burnt sugar smell, like green walnut hulls. While the body is full and rich, it’s simply too hot and young to make for pleasant drinking. The finish is long and spicy, but needs more time to mellow.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
79,Orphan Barrel Whoop & Holler,42.0,Miscellaneous,175,"This composite includes 28 year old barrels that yielded a flavor profile similar to pre-Prohibition blends. Smoke, mint, herbs, dandelion, chamomile, and horehound. Earthiness warms the palate with a slight hint of whole-grain toast. A medium finish shows a bit of black licorice. This style is so reminiscent of early 1900s whiskeys that it’s a must-pour for a palate history lesson. You just don’t taste these notes elsewhere.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
79,Wyoming Whiskey Private Stock Bourbon Unfiltered 6 year old,,Craft Whiskey,45,"Generously oaky, with sawdust, horse saddle, vanilla, honey, and a chalky, mineral quality on the nose. The palate is mouth-coating, with a full-bodied punch of sweet fruit, caramel, treacle, and heat, but even with dilution, the astringent wood tannins, chalk dust, and dry leathery finish come on too quickly. The rare craft bourbon that might have been better a bit younger. <em>(Loch &amp; K(e)y exclusive)</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
79,Montgomery Sudden Wisdom Rye 2 year old,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Fruit driven, with banana and circus peanuts candies, florals, and violet candies, this turns more peppery and minty on the palate, where warm cereal meets some varnish notes with a bit of heat and slight bitterness that makes it feel a bit rough around the edges. 100% Montana and Canada rye, aged 2 years in full-sized barrels.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
79,Parker’s Heritage (distilled Spring 1991) 24 year old,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,250,"Take just a moment to admire the color; it’s nearly red after 24 years. Then admire the fragrance, with florals, fruit, caramel, and vanilla bargaining for their time over prominent oak. Complexity of earth, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, bitter chocolate, light cinnamon, sautéed mushrooms, watermelon Jolly Rancher, and a hint of tobacco. Eventually, woodiness and bitterness set in and dominate the palate. Too much wood.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
79,Straight Edge Bourbon,42.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"A composite of 5, 7, and 8 year old Kentucky and Tennessee bourbons. It offers exceptional color at this ABV, but the grain and oak-forward nose suggests youth, with hints of medicinal boiling oatmeal and cinnamon. Slightly dry to adhesive mouthfeel is followed by menthol, heavy smoke, cinnamon-custard pie, licorice, caramel, and a hint of cherry cough syrup. With the stocks selected for this batch, I’d hoped for more, but it tastes unlike traditional bourbon. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
79,Palm Ridge Reserve,45.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Distilled from corn, malted barley, rye, and flaked rye, and aged in small barrels with toasted orangewood chips. While this whiskey smacks of its youth, with green flavors of burnt cane stalks wrapped in orange blossom honey and charred marshmallow, there is something compelling about its primary spirit quality, freshness, and sincerity. A fine example of what it aims to be—young small-barrel whiskey.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
79,Chambers Bay Greenhorn Bourbon (Batch 1),44.0,Craft Whiskey,27,"Initial aromas of boiled corncob, sugarcane stalks, and burnt sugar give a suggestion of youth and slight bitterness. Dig a little deeper and the secondary flavors of honeyed fruit, green apple, lavender, vanilla, and fresh oak reveal potential. While clearly young, there is still a lot to admire in this soft and delicate wheated bourbon, with its hints of smoke and a mouthwatering saltwater taffy finish, possibly derived from aging in floating boathouses on Puget Sound. 375ml",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
79,Ourbeer Tokaji Finish 3 year old,43.0,Swiss,82,"The makers of Unser Bier in the Gundeli district of Basel produce this young whisky and host an annual seminar in November, where guests learn about distillation and maturation from the master brewer. The nose has honey and melon, but it’s drenched in the sweet wine notes. The palate mingles the melon and honey flavors with sugared sultana until the sweetness abates, bringing out more fruit skins, then a surprising spearmint note on the finish. CHF79",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
79,Stouted,45.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Small barrel-type aromas: sharp, fresh oak and hot grain, but also cocoa hulls and coffee grounds. Tastes youthfully hot, and chocolatey, and sweet, and the oak is raw and forward. More chocolate than stout, I think. (375 ml.)",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
79,Canadian Shield,43.0,Canadian,27,"Family-owned Domaine Pinnacle uses rye, malted barley, and corn spirits to create a lovely, if typical, Canadian blended whisky. Their 430-acre farm, just a stone’s throw from the Vermont border in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, produces award-winning apple cider too. Prune juice, raspberries, toffee, hints of coffee; lush, mild vegetal notes on the nose. Peppery, sweet, creamy, and somewhat simple. Lovely burn.

79,Glenrothes Peated Cask Reserve,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,61,"A 1992 ‘Rothes finished in a peated cask, this shows immediate smoke along with some cellar notes. Behind is some laurel and a light lemon touch. It has surprising intensity. It’s all very clean and fresh, but while the smoke is there it wanders about in a somewhat distracted fashion. Like the recent Glenlivet peated cask offering it just lacks integration. Maybe if you want smoke, you should peat the barley. Who’da thunk it? £42",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
79,Coppersea Green Malt Barley,48.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Another “green malt” whiskey from Coppersea, a method they found in an old Scottish text for making whiskey from unkilned malt. This is much more vegetal than the rye (reviewed in Summer 2014); rank grass aroma, with a sweetness behind it, without the lovely complexity of the rye. Bitter and stemmy; hot and sweet as it closes. I much prefer the rye.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
79,High Commissioner,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,15,"You’re familiar with those generic blended Scotch whiskies of debatable origin with an inoffensive flavor profile, right? This isn’t one of those. With aromas of the fruit and foliage of an orange grove, beeswax, and a grassy note, this is a juicy, citrus-led dram that puffs out in the mouth, bringing a tingle of light pepper, ginger, and thick fudge. Despite the thinner mouthfeel, the baked orange and bitter Seville orange on the finish give it some bite. Perfectly serviceable.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
79,Oppidan Solera Aged Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Woodsy, wet leaves and fallen trees, dry grain bin, and fresh-cut cherrywood aromas. Cherry and dark plum up front, passing through to cocoa and wood, and chocolate-cherry candy on the end...none of which tastes like anything I&#039;d call “bourbon” until the very last whisper of the finish. How do you make bourbon without a hint of corn or oak to it? Some strange ideas here.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
79,Potter’s Crown,40.0,Canadian,15,"Dusty on the nose with increasing caramel notes. A bit spirity. A semi-sweet palate with initially mild peppers flickers into a pleasing, gingery glow. Suggestions of bitterness in the middle are subdued by increasing sweetness. Simple, but very nice. Caramel notes quickly become hot and peppery, then a smooth oiliness soothes the palate until it ends on a peppery and barely bitter finish. A great mixer with ginger ale.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
79,Garrison Brothers Cowboy Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,199,"Quite dark for 4 year old whiskey. Nose is fierce, unrestrained by the glass, and full of caramel, baking spices, and dusty corn. It’s hot and oaky, but dominated by a broad cornmeal placidity that keeps the flaming oak well in check. Water brings out mint, but brings a cloying edge to the corn; it’s better hot and rocking. A huge evaporative loss made for a tiny yield, but even so, the price just seems crazy.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
79,Glory Irish Poitín,40.0,Poitín,25,"Styled as the Original Moonshine, these aromas whisper of sweet summer fruits, golden barley, and potato farls. There is no lightning bolt of alcohol sipping at 40% ABV, but it is smooth and pleasantly tasty; flavors of melon, apple, and sugared biscuits, finishing with a barley tickle around the gums. A versatile addition to your cocktail armory from West Cork Distillers of Skibbereen, but I found it lost much of its appeal poured over ice.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
79,Douglas Laing Single Minded (distilled at Jura) 8 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,48,"Bottled as part of Douglas Laing’s Single Minded range, which focuses on young small batch bottlings, this 8 year old Jura matured in two refill sherry butts after being distilled in April 2006. Pear drops, pine nuts, and damp woodland on the nose. The palate is light and fruity, though dark spices and aniseed soon emerge. Peppery oak in the dry finish. £33",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
79,Meaghers 1878,40.0,Canadian,15,"A robust, pleasing, yet simple session whisky, 1878 is made for mixing and shooting but not for contemplation. Wet stones with some sweetness on the nose predict the almost liqueur-like sweetness of the palate. It quickly becomes hot and zippy with a white pepper payload. Before long some slight bitter pithiness creeps in, then subsides leaving crème brulée and Caramac candy bar, with a rich, almost eggy mouthfeel. The finish is short with cleansing grapefruit pith. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$19",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
79,Dublin in the Rare Auld Times 10 year old,40.0,Irish,64,"A 10 year old single malt whiskey bottled for Pete St. John by Glendalough musters a low-key olfactory range with reference points of malted barley, sawn oak, and soft fudge. A woozy haze of toffee buttercream, vanilla, and clotted cream hang on a light structure. The flavor has limited room to maneuver, roaming around a palate of sponge cake, fudge fingers, and ginger snaps before it putters out with a dry, fleeting finish. €60",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
79,Red River Single Barrel Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,40,"Light brown sugar, orange candy, and cinnamon on the nose, along with just a hint of funk. Electric in the mouth, zapping out to every corner and tooth with bitter oils and hot alcohol, with a backing wall of corn sweetness. The finish is almost a relief. Take the rattlesnake graphic as a warning; this one&#039;s not kidding.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
79,Adirondack Distilling 601 Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,65,"The bottle states “Aged less than four years” but the nose says probably less than two. Unseasoned oak and sawdust dominate the nose. If you can get through the oak you’ll find honey, corn, cinnamon, and beef jerky. On the palate it’s dry cornmeal, caramel, and a hefty portion of abrasive oak. The mid-palate is big spice with cinnamon, black pepper, clove, and oak. A short dry finish puts a bow on a whiskey that’s overly tannic, dry, and oaky.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
79,West Cork Original Classic Blend,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,27,"Cinnamon bark, oak, overripe nectarines, salted peanuts, and faint herbal notes open up this blended whiskey housed in the bottle with the clever geographical label. The structure starts light on the first sip, with Golden Delicious apples and honey lozenges, but then it thickens up mid-palate when the spiciness kicks in. Then it peters out. A decent spicy buzz finishes this perfectly serviceable blend composed by these determined newcomers to the Irish whiskey scene.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
79,Master of Malt Darkness! Ardbeg 21 year old PX Cask Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,202,"Finishing in octave-sized PX casks has resulted in the creation of an oddity: the world’s first Ardbeg cordial. There’s smoke, pigskin leather, and a sudden rootiness, mixed with damp woodland, stewing Victoria plums, and a weirdly lactic note. This continues on the tongue, giving an effect like smoked cream cheese dotted with raisins. Hmm…£120/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
79,Tormore 16 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Amber in hue, this starts off very succulent and approachable, with some butterscotch, vanilla, and caramel toffee, but like its brother, it dries. The palate is lighter than the 14 year old, and seems to float, lacking an anchor. When it does come down, it does so with a cereal crunch. Water lightens it still further, just leaving a mix of oak and cereal, and an astringent finish.<em> (France only) </em>€56",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
79,Benjamin Prichard’s Single Malt,40.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"The American craft whiskey movement has produced some unique riffs on classic spirits. Here we get a classic Irish-type whiskey made in Tennessee and aged in small, 15-gallon barrels. It’s all lush Irish on the nose, with caramel, green apple, dark chocolate, oak. On the palate the oak from the small barrel overtakes caramel apple with its smoky barrel char, sawdust, and clove spice. An interesting idea, but perhaps better realized in larger or used barrels.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
79,Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 1992 21 year old HH9451,,Single Grain Whisky,108,"A sweet, aromatic nose, with fresh cream, flaked almonds, macaroons, pomegranate juice, and a veneer of vanilla from this refill barrel. The palate starts warm and sweet, then revs up to full power; light butterscotch, cotton candy, clementine, Toledo marzipan, and corn kernels, with a hint of fresh green salad leaves. The short finish picks over corn, cake mix, and cream soda. Power, but not enough finesse from the wood here. £64",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
79,James Foxe,40.0,Canadian,11,"The lush, weighty mouthfeel of this affordable mixing whisky surprises, as does the gently complex parade of ripe red cherries and plums, Weetabix cereal, dry green hay, pencil shavings, and blistering ginger root. There’s a lot of whisky here, though it’s light and subtle. What burns in the mouth is slippery smooth in the throat, ending in classic Canadian bitter grapefruit pith. Tasting suggestion: add ginger ale. A pleasing citron residue lingers in the empty glass.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2014
79,Coldcock,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,23,"Black bottle, cocked-fist logo. Sourced whiskey, infused with “green tea, hibiscus, eucalyptus, fennel, gingko and more.” Smells <em>schnapps</em>-ish, bright floral and woodsy notes, with a medicinal twang. Quite sweet, but not sticky; the herbs keep it perky. The whiskey is tamped down by the sweet and infusion; the finish gets even more medicinal. I’d like less sweet, and more whiskey. Not sure who the market is for this, but it makes a tasty add to tea.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
79,Sons of Liberty Battle Cry,40.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"Craft beer whiskey: mashbill of 80% malt/20% rye malt, fermented with a Belgian ale yeast that yields spicy aromas. Nose is mostly young oak, like a small barrel whiskey, but there are some subtle spice notes and sweet malt. Creamy mouth, sweet but not sticky, and the orange and spice I’m picking up are likely from that yeast. Body is luscious; best part of the whiskey, because the finish turns prickly. There’s promise here, but delivery’s delayed. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
79,Seven Stills Chocasmoke,47.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Distilled from an oatmeal stout with a shot of peat, this intrigued even before the cap popped. It does smell like an oatmeal stout: cocoa, grains, fresh bread, restrained smoke, mixed with small-barrel oak. The smoke blows up in the mouth, much more evident, and the chocolaty, honey-sweet base rolls underneath…but it’s shallow, without the richness of a properly-aged scotch. Craft whiskeys want to grow up so fast, but this is like a kid in his dad’s clothes. (400 bottles only) Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
79,Peach Mist,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,10,"Canadian Mist with flavor and sweetener. Boozy but fresh peach, vanilla, and sugar nose; smells like a fresh, juicy peach cobbler; where&#039;s the whisky? Very much dessert-like in the mouth, sweet, full, but not cloying; points for that. Finish is peach candies, vanilla, and finally some whisky notes. Even at 35%, I&#039;d like a lot more whisky character here; otherwise, what&#039;s the point? Still, head and shoulders above Southern Comfort&#039;s flavor experiments.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
79,The Singleton of Dufftown 28 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,455,"Bottled as one of last year’s Diageo Special Releases, this is very minty to start: mint chocolate to be precise, before Brazil nut and toasted bran appear, given balance by creamy oak. This mix of nuts and sweetness continues on the tongue alongside an early burst of strawberry, but the center and back palate are foosty (as we say in Scotland), or dusty, as you probably do.",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
79,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Craigellachie) 1996,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Craigellachie is one of Scotland’s most interesting distilleries: its worm tubs providing a deliberately sulfury new make whose aromas flash off after maturation to reveal a deeply floral, pineapple-accented palate. Here, sadly, an inactive cask has meant that cabbagey sulfur has not been fully worked out. The fleshiness of the mature spirit is emerging, but this should have been kept in cask for another five years or so. Lacks balance and maturity. £60",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
79,Rich & Rare,40.0,Canadian,10,"Very sweet butterscotch, sultanas, and smatterings of oak play off lime juice, sweet and sour sauce, and pulling citrus pith in a spirity but quintessentially smooth whisky. Creamy caramel shows hints of fudge that softens the crispness of freshly split red cedar shakes. Simple and tightly integrated. A sintering peppery heat quickly dominates the palate even as overripe fruits emerge in a finish that moves single-mindedly into a classic citric zest. A frisky mixer that is well worth sipping.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
79,Darby's Reserve Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,24,"Sharp, bitterly vegetal, reminiscent of crushed turnip or radish; sweet oaky caramel in the background. Building block flavors—oak, rye oil, more turnip, sweet cereal—not well integrated. As if a very tight-cut new make had been put in a barrel and rolled and heated continuously for a short period of time (with some turnips). Finish is initially sweet, then closes with a bitter note. Turnip dissipates as it airs, but the memory lingers. Sourced whiskey. <i>(Total Wine exclusive.)</i>",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
79,Inchmurrin 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,108,"Inchmurrin has enjoyed a higher profile since early 2013, when the range was extended to include 15, 18, and 21 year old

expressions. The lineup also boasts striking new packaging and is bottled non-chill filtered. Orange fondant cream and peaches on the nose, with caramel in the background. Fuller-bodied than the 15 year old expression, with pineapple cheesecake and ginger on the palate. The finish is quite long, and spicier and more peppery than that of the 15 year old bottling (also reviewed this issue). £70",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
79,Rough Rider Bourbon Batch 1,45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Fiery young stuff! The nose is spicy/slicey, with a sharp sweetness, fresh oak, and a hint of solvent. A lot of oak in the mouth, almost drying, and just a bit astringent on the tongue. The finish turns softer, sweeter, but stays oaky. The wood’s a bit overwhelming on this one. It’s sourced whiskey that’s then finished in Long Island wine barrels. Some finishes work better than others.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
79,Dillon’s The White Rye,40.0,Canadian,,"It’s not whisky in Canada, nor does it pretend to be. Canada’s three-year aging law keeps un-aged whisky off the market. So, with no moonshine or firewater tradition, Canada’s craft distillers must make their white spirits as palatable as the matured whiskies they could eventually become. The result is simple, gingery, and sweet, with latent peppermint, licorice, and beer. The palate dissolves in a longish finish where sizzling pepper grows refreshingly bitter before fading to… nothingness. <i>(Ontario only) </i>C$37",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
79,Embrujo,40.0,Spanish Whisky,,"This is a Spanish whisky from the Granada region. It's not Spain's first whisky or its best, but this could eventually be a contender. Its problem is that it has sulfur all over it: a deliberate attempt to empower the malt, or sloppy whisky making? Get past it though, and this is a thin, light orange and mandarin aperitif whisky, and ideal to serve chilled early on a sunny, summer Spanish evening. It's about context. Not earth-shattering though. €80",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
79,Diggers & Ditch,,Australian Whisky,,"Given that this is described as a blend and it's from the New Zealand Whisky Co., you'd be well within your rights to stay clear. But it's not, it’s a blend of two single malts from two different countries, New Zealand and Australia; what will soon be known as Hybrid. It's not the best from either country, dumbing down the big flavors and leaving the fruit and spice falling a little flat. Arguably another good entry level whisky, though.  NZ$95",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
79,Copper Fox Single Malt Spirit,62.0,Craft Whiskey,,"The malt was “lightly smoked” with a 60/40 mix of apple and cherry woods. It is very light in the nose, which gives a fruitbowl—apple, white grape, pear—topped with wet malt, and just a hint of that smoke. Very hot, as expected, but the smoke is more pronounced, with a creamy texture. Water brings out more malt, and notes of cocoa, ripe Red Delicious apple, and nuts…and a somewhat rough finish. Interesting, and mixable.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
79,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1961 (Cask #1325),47.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is coming from a first fill sherry hogshead, so there’s little surprise that the color is as dark as pitch. This is Glenfarclas at its most concentrated; less about dried fruit and more about highly-roasted espresso with a glass of ancient Marsala on the side. The palate shows firm grip moving into astringency. Too much cask for me, but if this is what rocks your boat, go for it! £840",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
79,Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania White Rye,50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"There’s the sweet reek of new make: barely ripe apricot and peach, green grain, a hint of spice. The spirit is surprisingly dry, with shots of grain, pepper, and some clean alcohol notes on the top, but a well-mannered 100 proof indeed, and easy to hold on the tongue. There’s a dry twist of anise on the finish. An interesting — and promising — white whiskey. (Pennsylvania only.)",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
79,Coyote Ugly,40.0,Canadian,,"Slightly medicinal/mineral edge to a nose full of caramel. Hot in the mouth, slick and sweet, but with some currant and quince floating around; there’s more than a bit of youthful whiteness here. The finish stays hot and prickles the tongue a bit. A bold Canadian, with some flaws, but interesting nonetheless. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
79,Tullamore Dew 12 Year Old,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,,"To a great extent, this is traditional blended Irish whiskey by the numbers. Its problem — through no fault of its own — is that it’s bland compared to the wave of full-flavored whiskeys that have been released of late. The twelve years in cask don't add much to the standard Tullamore Dew beyond a sharp note. The apple and pear flavors are perfectly acceptable, however, and the whiskey's pleasant enough; it's just not very exciting.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
79,Port Askaig 19 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"London-based specialist The Whisky Exchange won’t reveal where its main Islay brand is distilled, though the smart money is on a distillery not that far away from the ferry terminal that gives it its name. This expression is less phenolic than you might expect; there’s more rapeseed oil than smoke, but it does have a nori wrap shoreline character. The palate is discreet, with pineapple and creaminess leading the way toward a bonfire made of old fishboxes. £60",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
79,Dark Corner Moonshine,50.0,White Whiskey,,"White whiskey, amazing legs on the glass. Classic white dog nose: green corn, estery fruits, a bit sharp, but not burny hot. Clean taste of corn spirit, no off flavors, and very well-mannered for 50%, unaged whiskey; I can hold this on my tongue easily, and there are some good bits of sweet candy as it rolls off. Nicely done.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
79,Duncan Taylor Rare Auld (distilled at Aberlour) 1993 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Shy is the word. Pale in color, again suggestive of little cask interaction. There’s a little hint of white currant and light cereal, delicate and fragile — more fragile than the Balmenach — with a little touch of white chocolate. As it opens, out comes violet. The mouth is tense, as if everything is still baled up, even after all this time. Very light acidity gives a certain freshness that water doesn’t shake loose. Simply not enough cask. £67",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
79,Roughstock Montana Whiskey,45.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),,"An odd touch of the roasted-grain smell of the dryhouse here, then youthful whiskey underneath it: sweet, mint, barrel. Flavors tumble across the tongue: cocoa, mint, coconut, grass, and a bit of spice. This is six months in the barrel, and it's good for that; I also like that it's all Montana-grown grain. But you have to wonder what it will be like after another four years. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
79,Nant French Oak Port Matured,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"Nant is everything an idyllic island distillery should be, sited in the wilds of Tasmania with a smart visitor center and a bar that overlooks the rolling, rugged countryside. The whiskey, though, is surprisingly gentle and soft. There is an overly simplistic sweet sherry version, but this gutsier, berry-soaked, sweet and rounded version is the one to watch. It's a work in progress, but the cleanliness and flavor development hint at great things. Watch this space.  $AUS 190/500 ml",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
79,Heaven Hill Trybox Series Corn,,White Whiskey,25,"New make from the same mashbill as Evan Williams, bottled “straight from the still.” Much higher proof than the others, but not noticeably hotter in the nose; that’s light corn and grass, with a bit of minty spice. Hotter in the mouth, but quite pleasant and evolving: fresh mint gives way to light corn, then a slightly oily slip to brisk sweetness…and you realize you didn’t notice the serious overproof. A well-behaved white dog.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
79,Old Hobart Overeem Sherry Cask,55.0,Australian Whisky,,"The latest addition to Tasmania’s burgeoning and diverse whisky industry bottles for the first time in October 2011. This is just 4 years old, and while this isn’t Kavalan, the flavor is amazing: full and rich sherry, honeyed, intense, and fruity. The score reflects the fact that it’s well-made, yet way short of its optimum age. But wow — what a prospect this distillery is! AUD150 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
79,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1974,,Single Malt Scotch,820,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The nose immediately betrays the fact that this has been matured in a first-fill sherry hogshead. It’s akin to an artisan’s workshop, all leather oil and strange resins. There’s an intriguing hint of curry spices and truffle, but all in all this is about density, black fruits (damson), allspice, and clove. The cask is in charge. The palate has more tannin than you perhaps want — powerful and grippy with lots of nut and tea-like tannins; too grippy for me. £500",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
79,"Belgian Owl 4 year old, cask L140211",46.0,Belgian Whisky,,"This is very different to previous Belgian Owl bottlings, but it’s important because it takes the distillery to a new place. There are hints of Glen Garioch or Springbank here, with green banana skin, raw barley, and some peppery tomato. The fruity center just about survives the onslaught, but it’s not an easy ride. €47 Currently not available in the U.S.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
79,Thomson 17 year old,,New Zealand,,"Thomson has discovered and bottled stocks from the Willowbank distillery, which closed in the 90s. It was, almost certainly, the world’s most southern distillery, located at Dunedin, a South Island city populated by Scots (the name is an amalgam of Dundee and Edinburgh). The whisky? Not bad at all. Sweet, edgy, prickly, with pineapple and kumquat, banana, and salt and pepper. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
79,Glen Spey 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Somewhat sidelined thanks to the presence of Glenrothes and Glen Grant (not to mention Speyburn) in the same village, Glen Spey gets on with producing fillings for numerous Diageo blends (primarily J&B). As a result, it’s rarely seen as a single malt, with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground.

This 21 year old is the color of old gold, and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings, there’s a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind, which is strangely hard to pin down. Coconut cream? Suntan lotion? Blackening butter in a frying pan? Eventually it appears to settle in the crème brûlée area, along with a fruity base (sweet, of course). There’s a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through, but water suggests it’s new wood. 

In the mouth, there’s vanilla fudge and toffee, before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. Overall it’s a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. Showy and impressive, but for me the wood’s in charge. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
79,Early Times 354 Bourbon,40.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),,"Sweet corn, along with caramel, vanilla, and more subtle ripe summer fruits (on the nose and palate). Light, slightly brash finish. Rather sweet, somewhat youthful tasting, straight-forward, and unpretentious. Not something I would be drinking neat, but it does fare better on the rocks. (The ice and cold water cut through and calm the sweetness.) I think a little more aging would add some depth, and balance some of the sweetness with more oak spice.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
80,Omar Sherry Cask-Finished Single Malt,46.0,Taiwanese Whisky,90,"The bottle may project a Tolkienesque image of a craft distillery run by Bilbo Baggins, but this is produced at Taiwan’s state-owned Nantou Distillery. This lacks sweetness and structure. The meaty nose has prune juice, star anise, lamb tagine, and predominant sour notes throughout the syrupy-textured palate, with flavors of raspberry syrup, pomegranate, and gummy cherries, then tame spices and jumbled savory notes.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
80,Alberta Premium,40.0,Canadian,20,"When high-rye whisky seemed doomed, some hard-bit fans longed to taste a simple mixer called Alberta Premium. With few ryes to compare, reviewers assessed this all-rye grain whisky generously. Today, with rye whisky booming and rye’s flavor diversity understood, opinions are more informed. Enjoy the caramels, mild wood, light peppery rye spices, and ginger of this old-style 100% rye by a campfire or in a Highball. (<em>Canada only</em>) $27 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
80,Old Grand-Dad,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"An odd combo of cornbread and pine trees starts this whiskey just before the grains develop. Think rye bread, oatmeal, and barley. Then it’s caramel and vanilla before a blast of cinnamon. This whiskey is far too soft and short to hold up as a sipper. It’s best in batched cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
80,Cleveland Underground Bourbon Finished with Apple Wood,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Juicy Fruit gum, Kool-Aid, sugared orange gumdrops, and candied papaya and mango meet fresh-cut lumber on the nose. The palate has notes of bruised banana and juicy guava, with assertive wood and cocoa powder to balance the sweetness.



<em>This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.</em>

Actual Time in Barrel: varies, but usually around 3 months;

Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using apple wood pieces.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
80,MacQueen’s 3 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,13,"MacQueen’s has an impressive range of age statement blends, but this is the youngest one. Faint caramel and toast, a mild rub of whole spice, and snuff tobacco. The mouthfeel is meager and lacks any real punch; there is spice and fudge, but little sweetness. More caramel flavors develop alongside chocolate notes before a dry, quick finish. There are better options around, even at this price.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
80,Jim Beam White Label,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,16,"Grain in several forms begin this experience. First it’s raw corn kernels, freshly buttered popcorn, boiled oats, rye toast, and cornbread. Then oak, raisins, and slight hints of vanilla develop, but the concentrated cornbread dominates after its appearance. However, though at a low proof, water is needed to cut the heat. Recommended with ice, water, and/or cola.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
80,Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,27,"Initially, it’s earth and fruit. This develops into sawdust, more earth, and bananas. From here, it’s green pepper, banana nut bread, and warm corn tortillas over a soft mouthfeel with little complexity. This will work in a pinch and it’s great in ginger ale, Coca-Cola, or lighter cocktails, but it’s probably best over ice.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
80,Reservoir Wheat Whiskey,50.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"An unusual style, made from 100% wheat. Hints of stone fruit, brown apples, and molasses come cloaked in earthy aromas of saddle leather, woodpile, and husky grain. Shows well for its age, and quite smooth, but the oak dominates and aromas seem dulled, with vanilla, oak bitterness, and dark chocolate on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
80,Whistling Andy Harvest Select Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"This whiskey pours light, sweet, and pure, with fresh bread and honeyed malt up front while displaying some evident youth to the spirit. The palate offers warm cereals, floral notes, Bit-O-Honey candy, and malty sweetness on the palate. Not especially complex, but delicate, clean, and pretty.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
80,Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,40,"Beginning with charcoal smoke, oak, herbs, and vanilla, grains set in, in the form of cornbread, rye muffin, and spelt pasta. This 3 year old lacks the mouthfeel or richness one hopes for in a rye. The finish is flat and short. This is an okay cocktail mixer, but lacks the oomph for a sipper.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
80,Inchmurrin 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,150,"Rich on the nose, with damp tweed, malt, and a suggestion of earthiness. Finally, salted butter. The palate offers muted tropical fruits, soft gingery oak, and more earthiness. In the finish, the oak becomes more overt without dominating.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
80,Inchmurrin Madeira Wood Finish,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Surprisingly the most reticent nose of the three Inchmurrins. Mild orchard fruit, apple blossom, cocoa powder, and a hint of nutmeg. Initially, red grapes and almonds on the palate, with the fruit then darkening to raisins and developing oak. The finish is long, spicy, dry, and oaky, with persistent background fruitiness trying to break through.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
80,White Oak Akashi Japanese Blended Whisky,40.0,Japanese,45,"Like a trip to the stalls of an old spice market, the traders beckoning you closer with their colorful wares. Nutmeg, fennel seed, and caraway on the nose, then papery dried oak leaves, toast crumbs, and slightly pungent notes of chive and shucked pea pods. This is a fatter, more glutinous whisky than the single malt. Lemon glaze, fudge, honey, nectarine, and kumquat balance an undercurrent of pepper, cinnamon, and mustard seed. A slightly sour swallow, then the spices reign supreme.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
80,Jim Beam Double Oak,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,22,"Wood. From the lumberyard to the charred barrels, wood powers over grain, caramel, vanilla, and earth. A nuttiness comes through, turning the wood into almond, pine nut, and pecan, but a resounding bitterness stays in the form of nut shells. It lacks balance and complementary flavors to the oak, but caramel finds itself on a short finish. Decent first release, but I wanted to find more nuance from the second barrel.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
80,The Sovereign (distilled at Invergordon) 50 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,300,"You can smell the time that has elapsed on this dark, chestnut dram. Glimpses of vanilla essence, mushroom gills, blueberries, aged balsamic vinegar, and beef stock. Flavors swirl around charred meat juices, walnut oil, chewed leather, <i>rancio</i>, tobacco leaf, tree bark, black toffee, and licorice root. A slight creamy salvation tugs it from its oaky and savory comfort zone. The moderate finish is awash with Brazil nut and bitter coffee grounds. Forget about adding water. An ancient, fragile grain whisky. (<i>K&amp;L Wines exclusive</i>)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
80,Bunnahabhain Moine PX 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,123,"Bunnahabhain’s peaty expression is steadily coming together. It’s been one of those drams that seems to need more time than many, but that’s true of Bunna’ in general, come to think of it. In fact, the peatiness is quite mild on the nose, adding some scent to the sandalwood elements and obvious raisined sweetness. There’s a slightly cheesy note in the background and a touch of sulphur on the palate. It’s not quite wholly integrated, but progressing well. <em>(Fèis Ìle 2016,</em> 833 bottles) £95",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
80,Laphroaig Cairdeas Madeira Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,75,"The annual Cairdeas release aims to show Laphroaig in a new light. Initially I thought this too sweet and cask dominated, with the distillery battling against the wine—fresh red fruit and seaweed is a test, even for the best chef. Add water and give it time though, and there is this lightly exotic, herbal, hazelnut-like element. It lacks depth and the tarry thump beloved by many Laphroaig lovers, but is an interesting departure.",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
80,High West American Prairie Bourbon (Batch 16B16),46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"A blend of straight bourbons. Light straw color. An expressive dark cherry, cooked grains, and wood nose opens up to a bevy of custard, roasted pine nuts, and herbs, with hints of tobacco and smoked hazelnuts. A grain-forward approach leaves it slightly unbalanced, until roasted nuts save the day with a tinge of vanilla and caramel-flavored popcorn. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
80,The Singleton of Glendullan Double Matured,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,89,"The double maturation here is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks finished off in what Diageo will only say is a “special” cask. That’s helpful. There’s a breakfast-style opening here of warm bagels with grape jelly, then comes citrus, before some of that dusky distillery character creeps in. It’s quite bulked-up in the center of the palate, but finishes cleanly. One for those who like things on the thick-set side. <em>(Travel Retail exclusive)</em>",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
80,The Epicurean,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,44,"This is the Lowland entry into Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts collection, and on approach the nose is like sipping lemonade in a malt hopper: gristy malt, lemon, lime, honeydew melon, vanilla pods, peach, and apricot. A similarly juicy palate, gaining sweet grassy notes, Spangles, and confectioners’ sugar, before ending on a finish of dried citrus and fizzy Refreshers. True to the region, but the Epicurean makes the rest of the range look brighter, quicker, smarter, and tastier in comparison. £34",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
80,Cooper River Rye,43.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Rich copper in color, following just 55 weeks in a 17-gallon barrel at low proof (106.2), this whiskey is caught between youth and ambition, as flavors of leathery oak, earth, dried apple, and dates emerge to meet green twigs and briar, and some musty basement. Generous and broad-shouldered, this rye aims high, with solid structure and robust spice, but is overwhelmed by dusty, bitterly tannic oak on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
80,The Hilhaven Lodge,40.0,Miscellaneous,50,"Straw to light tawny. This blend of straight American whiskeys comes alive with wood, floral, citrus, and cola. The taste presents a heftier body than the 40% ABV suggests, with hints of coffee, nutmeg, and cornbread. This has a warm, astringent finish that gives cinnamon, caramel, and grain. Leaves me wanting more from the experience. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
80,Jefferson’s Reserve Old Rum Cask,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"What happens when 8 year old bourbon rests in a bourbon barrel-turned-rum barrel for 14 months? This is it. Muted caramel, vanilla, and spice meet salt, dried fruit, and almond extract, with a short cereal grain finish. An open mind will find this interesting. But for the traditionalist, this isn’t bourbon. I applaud the rum cask use, but this barrel appears not to be the perfect marriage for my glass.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
80,Longmorn The Distiller’s Choice,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,68,"The latest in Chivas Bros. no age statement (NAS) variant of their malts and while the nose here does have Longmorn’s fruity elements, they are discreet. This is also the case on the palate, where what is usually thick, elegant, and fruity has had its volume turned down. Blind, it’s a nice dram, but I don’t want nice from Longmorn, I want great. £47",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
80,Singleton of Glen Ord Signature,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Signature was new to the Singleton of Glen Ord range in 2013 as part of the Travel Retail exclusive Singleton Reserve Collection. Soft toffee, banana, and ginger on the nose accompanied by slightly herbal and pine notes. Sweet and easy-drinking, with a suggestion of sherry and drying oak. Licorice in the finish. RM263",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
80,Stillhouse Original Moonshine,40.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"As mentioned in my column this issue, Stillhouse is packaged in a stainless steel can, much like the ones used for paint thinner. Labeled “100% corn whiskey.” Clean scent of corn, green corn stalks, and apples. Very similar on the tongue, with just a hint of burn. For what it is, this is not bad; clean, tasty, definitely a good mixer. They have several flavored versions as well. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
80,Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 21 year old 1993,,Single Grain Whisky,117,"Unmistakably grainy in character, this offers aromas of pink lemonade Dubble Bubble, faint vanilla, confectioner’s sugar, and mild herbal tones. Its redeeming qualities are the good thick texture and creamy, buttery feeling in the mouth. Sparkling orange and processed raspberry and strawberry flavors are hit by a surge of pepper and clove, which subsides to allow some late herbal notes to creep in. The finish has a heavy clove note. File this as a grain enthusiast’s grain whisky. £81",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
80,The Sovereign (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1990,,Single Grain Whisky,119,"Vicks inhaler (menthol, camphor, and pine needle oil), freshly unwrapped sticks of spearmint gum, cilantro, and root ginger make for a stimulating, if not exactly charming olfactory experience. Mouth-filling and structured with good weight, this has sweet orange and a mild gingery glow. Although there are fleeting vegetal notes, it stays just sweet of the middle. Close heat on the finish, saturating the taste buds with spice and dark citrus. £83",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
80,Deveron 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,24,"This expression from Macduff distillery was launched along with its 12 and 18 year old siblings in 2015. The nose is fresh and floral and offers light cereal notes and soft malt. The palate yields new-mown hay, toffee apples, and quite sweet oak. The finish is medium in length and softly spiced. <em>(France only) €21</em>",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
80,Rauch,45.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Riffing on the German smoked beer type. Light smoke and caramel on the nose. Very grassy front, the smoke slips in toward the middle, and it all ends up a bit confused, like dessert served in an ashtray. (375 ml.)",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
80,Old Forester,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,23,"With a mashbill of 72/18/10% (corn/rye/malted barley), Old Forester offers a traditional recipe in a contemporary proof. Ponder the basics: caramel and vanilla with hints of herbs and baking spices. Promise shows in pumpkin spice, custard, and burnt caramel, but there’s an unwanted high-alcohol note that dulls much of the sweeter taste. Its final moments are saved with hints of cinnamon. Good value bourbon.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
80,The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 2005 9 year old (Cask #6587),,Single Malt Scotch,576,"Drawn from a refill barrel, this is Balvenie all eager and bright at the start of its journey. It’s like an excited kid eating pancakes and runny honey (with a squeeze of lemon juice) at breakfast on her first day of school. There’s a hint of malt, a little peachiness, and a hint of the richness that will develop resonance in time. It’s lovely—I’d be happy to drink a couple—but way overpriced. The score has to reflect that. £400",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
80,Borders,,Single Grain Whisky,72,"A single grain whisky made equally from wheat and barley to keep you amused until R&amp;B Distillers builds their new distilleries. The first impression created by the <em>oloroso</em> cask finish is an abundance of fruit sugar sweetness; cherry, raspberry, plus freshly picked mint leaves. This is a bold, muscular, assertive grain, where the juicy fruit is soured by aniseed, licorice, and toasted walnut. Notes of dried apple accompany a hot, drying finish. Water straightens it all out though. £50",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
80,Rowhouse (e),50.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"The name is a reference to the “whisk(e)y” convention; this is a malt spirit, aged in a used American rye whiskey barrel. Light amber. Light nose of baker&#039;s chocolate, barrel, fruit candy, and boiled frosting. Spicy and prickly on the tongue (the rye?), with calming influence from the barrel. A lively swallow, sweet, spicy, a whack of cut lumber, and the sweetness of young malt. But there&#039;s a roughness that&#039;s not all fun; good spirit, needs more taming.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
80,Manatawny Still Works J. Potts,47.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"Unaged spirit, and smells like it: rich grain, a bit of loose-cut funkiness. Quite sweet in the mouth, more body than usual. Some oiliness, hints of cocoa and pastry, and a hint of something like bamboo shoots. Not as clean as some unaged spirit...but not as dull as some, either.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
80,Scapa Skiren,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"A new NAS expression from Scapa on Orkney, matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. An initial hint of lime cordial, then musty peaches, almonds, cinnamon, and table salt. More peaches on the palate, with tinned pear and a little honey. Tingling spices in the drying finish, which soon becomes quite bitter – detracting from the overall balance.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
80,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Dailuaine) 1996,,Single Malt Scotch,140,"Like being stuck inside the Dailuaine dark grains plant: all Marmite (yeast extract spread), deglazed roasting pan, and a cereal note. In other words, the distillery character is the major contributor. Some light nuttiness, but overall this is Dailuaine in funky guise. Becomes more, errr…<em>agricultural</em> with water. Robust and peppery on the tongue. A nice example, albeit without massive complexity.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
80,Old Hickory Blended Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"A blend of two MGP bourbons, 11% 2 year old, 89% 4 year old. Simple sweet corn nose, with some cinnamon and hard candies; hot for 40%. Underwhelming for a whiskey named for President Jackson; warm and sweet, though with some oak-based bitterness at the fringes. Stays sweet through the finish. Not flawed, but not well thought-out either. Might be the blandest MGP juice I’ve ever had. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
80,Wemyss Malts Rhubarb Royale (distilled at Benrinnes) 2001,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,102,"Here is Benrinnes in very summery guise, with its signature meatiness barely discernible. Instead you get lots of thyme, rosemary, and dried citrus peel. The palate is clean and concentrated, with a tart drive akin to red currant. It is this jangly effect which shows the need for dilution. Water does improve things, and while the sour fruits are still there, the effect is more calm. It does lack length though. £65",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
80,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Talisker) 6 year old 2008,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,85,"A single cask (#10699) bottling of Talisker, distilled in the winter of 2008 and matured in a refill hogshead before bottling in May 2015. Initially, a slight hint of new make, soon displaced by digestive biscuits, brine, and black pepper. Sweet oak, earthy peat, and orchard fruits on the palate. The finish is medium in length, with black coffee, licorice, and long-lasting spices.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
80,The Antiquary,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,20,"This venerable blend has a nose of mandarin syrup cake, vanilla cream, and cut hay, with chopped cilantro and other herbal top notes. Sweet and fruity, though verging on tasting of artificial sweeteners at times, there are malt notes and a developing butteriness, with sweet mandarin notes and sponge cake. It all hangs on a light structure but it’s less smooth on the finish, with a scratch of wood smoke.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
80,66 Gilead Du Bois,40.0,Canadian,33,"My goodness, this woman is an innovator. Distillery owner Sophia Pantazi stored her maple syrup in whisky barrels. Then once the syrup was bottled, she refilled those barrels with whisky spirit, giving maple-aged whisky. Grain, chocolate, and winter-welcome glowing spices quickly overtake a malty, grainy, perfumey note characteristic of young whisky. Though creamy sweet, the whisky has more toffee notes than maple syrup. Hot beyond its ABV and wanting a couple more years’ maturation. <em>(Distillery only) </em>Price is per 375 ml.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
80,Virgil Kaine Robber Baron Rye,,Craft Whiskey,35,"A blend of 94% rye-mash whiskey and Virgil Kane&#039;s High-Rye Bourbon (60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% barley). Floral rye grain spice bursts from the nose along with cedar plank and graphite. The entry is thick and sweet, with maple syrup, young oak, and rye spice. Things don&#039;t heat up until the end of the mid-palate where a dash of heat drives a long, spicy finish. An interesting mix of flavors that could benefit from a little more complexity.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
80,Goldlys PX Finish Cask 2650,43.0,Belgian Whisky,41,"The ‘Golden River’ was nicknamed after the color of the River Lys due to rotting flax. Here, a cool, breezy nose of lemongrass and almond paste meets aromas of black currant conserve and blueberry muffin as the sherry flavors try to cut in. There are initial dark, jammy fruits hidden in warm bakery goods, with damson, bramble, and malt, swept aside by flavors of mint, antiseptic, and Fisherman’s Friends. The finish is clean and icy cool with penetrating aniseed. €38",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
80,Centennial,40.0,Canadian,20,"The nose is slow to open up, and when it does it reveals simple rye spices and butterscotch. These become primary flavor notes on tasting. Biting spices burst onto a buttery palate before a pleasing bitterness seeps in. The second sip seems almost nutty and sweet, with pralines and thick cream. This 10 year old blend of all-wheat and rye-grain whiskies is simple, but displays its age with such subtleties as fading orange water and woodsy herbal notes. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$25",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
80,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Tamdhu) 16 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,101,"Pale straw. The nose is very draff-like/sweet mash, then green herbal notes, reminiscent of angelica. The palate remains light and slightly hot on the tongue, with some cereal and a certain fatness. Water brings out a little more from the cask. A delicate and pleasant enough dram, but I’m slightly bemused as to why it’s being bottled at this age when there’s clearly so much more to give. £69",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
80,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Mortlach) 8 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,66,"Very pale straw. The color indicates that there’s been no real cask activity. A little closed on the nose to start; clean, quite green and leafy (young ferns). The flavor however, makes up for this, with good mid-palate sweetness and some dark fruits beginning to assemble themselves in the middle. Of interest to completists. £45",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
80,Douglas Laing Premier Barrel (distilled at Glengoyne) 7 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Another youthful offering from Douglas Laing in its Premier Barrel series, presented in one of 863 ceramic decanters. This Glengoyne initially offers a nose of cherries and treacle before tinned tomatoes make their presence felt. Tangy fruits on the palate, malt, and spicy sausage. Caramel, spices, and a hint of oak in the finish. An interesting contrast to the older, more sherry cask-focused Glengoyne ‘house’ bottlings. £65",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
80,Douglas Laing Premier Barrel (distilled at Talisker) 5 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Following a similarly youthful Provenance range bottling of Talisker, and an NAS “Young and Feisty” variant, Douglas Laing has opted to release this 5 year old expression in its Premier Barrel lineup, complete with ceramic decanter, 495 of which were produced. Initially meaty, then peat smoke envelops the nose, with damp tweed backing it up. Black pepper and gunpowder tea on the bold palate; flinty, with lemon and lime. Lingering black pepper and a metallic tang in the finish. £75",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
80,Rebel Yell,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,13,"Redesigned label, wincingly generic in looks, even for a bottom-shelf 80 proofer. Whiskey’s quite light in color, and smells young as well: sweet, a wheated bourbon hint of peanuts, and just the faintest hint of wood. Mouth is warm, softly corny, and a little bittersweet on the finish. But that’s it. Just not much going on here.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
80,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 16 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Light gold. Fresh and clean, with light draff notes. Cool porcelain, lemon, cereal husk. It becomes more expressive on the tongue, though it remains subtle. A bit of a stealth bomb because the palate shows plenty of spice, cinnamon toast, and baklava. The finish reveals some green notes. When you add water, it becomes incredibly minty. Fragile, but if you fancy a Bunna&#039; julep, then look no further. £69",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
80,Glenkeir Treasures (distilled at Fettercairn) 6 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"This could be seen as a brave young bottling of the sometimes divisive Fettercairn single malt, but Glenkeir Treasures has acquired some interesting casks which showcase the youthful whisky to good advantage. Wet cardboard, starch, and savory notes on the initial nose, settling down to something fruitier and with milk chocolate. Floral, nutty, and slightly peppery on the palate, with almonds, toffee, cocoa powder, and gentle citrus fruit. Quite soft in the finish, with elegant spices and milky coffee. (<em>Whisky Shop only) </em>£35/500 ml",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
80,Red River Canadian Style Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,33,"Well, they got the proof right! From JEM Beverage (Carrollton, Texas). Sweet cedar and citrus in the nose, dominant and one-noted. Sweet on the tongue, with that fresh green cedar character and more sweet citrus; a touch of oak in the finish. Not a lot else.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
80,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Bowmore) 1982 Lochindaal Catch,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,1113,"A slightly perfumed nose offers up the slightly unusual pairing of dried lavender, sweet-cured herring, and then potpourri air freshener. This flies off to show wet dulse on warm sand. It starts sweetly with some nutmeg, then hot peppers. The smoke is very light, allowing a tantalizing glimpse of soft guava before the salinity returns. Water brings out the peat kiln but also that initial perfume. Muddled. £700",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
80,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Caol Ila) 1982 Smoke on the Water,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,215,"Quite a solid start for a Caol Ila which, like the 30 year old <em>(see above)</em>, pitches you into the farmyard, though this time it’s a sheep-shearing shed. There’s also some bacon and spent barbecue. The initial impression is of a pretty dry example, but some oil begins to seep through. The palate is explosive with some engine oil, becoming pretty flinty with violet notes, and the distillery sweetness is hidden. A little disjointed. £135",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
80,Glen Moray Elgin Classic,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,56,"The onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe. The nose is light and fruity: raspberry and cranberry juice, even a sprig of mint. Fresh, but with a background funkiness. In time, there’s ripe melon, then lightly musty wood comes through. The palate is light, giving the effect of diluted fruit juice. It’s all just a bit lacking in weight. £25",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
80,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) Batch 2,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,114,"Despite the high strength, the aromas strike the nose like a pillow in slow motion. Greengages, corn, and ripening lemons lift from the glass. It’s a thick, unctuous, layered mouthful with honey, gooseberry, and lemon acidity, though a splash of water produces softer notes of Scottish tablet and evaporated milk. A little sourness in the finish. Sure, part of the allure of Boutique-y whisky is the batch variations, but this is quite a different beast from the magnificent Batch 1. £72",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
80,Wigle Malted Rye,46.0,Craft Whiskey,34,"Another experimental “Whims” bottlings; this one is 95% malted rye and 5% malted barley. Nose is sharp, with notes of cinnamon candies and a bit of solvents. Better on the palate: a cooling breeze of minty rye, some citrus, and growing bitter rye oil as it finishes. Fairly simple, pleasant stuff, but the nose is not inviting. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
80,Twisted Manzanita Rebellious Rye,,Craft Whiskey,35,"A “whiskey distilled from rye malt mash,” which indicates aging in used barrels. Still has a deep coloring from port barrel finishing. Nose is quite peppery, youthfully vegetal, and sweet with fruit, again, presumably from the port barrel. Rye grassiness and spice in the mouth, wrapped with layers of port fruit and pepperiness that roll into the finish. Smooth for the strength, though the port is pushy and the flavors could be better balanced. An interesting direction.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
80,Bunnahabhain Moine Dram an Stiùireadair 10 year old Feis Ile 2014 bottling,,Single Malt Scotch,160,"Stiùireadair means “helmsman” in Gaelic. This has been finished for a year in Marsala casks. The nose is all garden compost, moist vegetation, light smoke, and highly oxidized: like a young <em>vin santo</em> (or indeed Marsala). Very nutty, with an almost vermouth-like quality. The palate is all clove, anise, cherry stone. Those oxidized wine notes are so dominant it’s shifted the balance toward the finish. This particular helmsman’s somewhat off course. £95",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
80,Douglas Laing Provenance Young & Feisty (distilled at Talisker),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Douglas Laing has added a no age statement bottling of Talisker to its Provenance range, tagging it as “Young and Feisty.” It comprises whisky from casks #10227 and 10229. Lively and up front, with bubblegum, wood smoke, and black pepper on the nose. Developing ozone. Zesty soft fruits, emerging dark peat notes, and more pepper on the palate. The finish is quite short, nutty, and slightly metallic. Young and feisty indeed! £65",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
80,Tormore 14 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Light amber. The nose offers up walnut bread, spelt flour, and a green, malty note. Overall, it’s slightly unyielding, with toasted oak, hazelnut, and barley. Water opens up a sweeter core: Lucozade, apricot kernel, and barley. The palate is where the apricot flesh turns up, but then it firms up quickly, snuffing that moment of levity out. Water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish. It’s the thing about Tormore; it just can’t let itself go. <em>(France only) </em>€42",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
80,Painted Stave Old Cooch’s Corn Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,25,"Bottle 170 of this Delaware distillery’s first batch. Full, oily aroma of sweet, wet, crushed corn; almost too rich. Very clean on the palate; light and sweet, a bit of dry leafiness. Impressive first effort. <em>(Delaware only)</em>",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
80,O’Begley Poitin,50.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"A locally-grown mashbill of 75% barley, 20% malt, 5% oats. Very aromatic for unaged spirit: fresh, grainy, a bit feinty/vegetal, split rock, and a note like well-rinsed crisp sauerkraut. It’s a quick and lively one in the mouth, sweet and slippery, grain and hints of fresh herbs (fennel, mace, white peppercorn). The finish is a bit sticky—the oats, maybe—and sweet. Interesting stuff.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
80,John Myer Wheat,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Furniture polish, red raspberries, popovers, a vigorous nose, going in several directions. Hot grainy mouth, not overwhelmed by wood; a simple grain finish like twice-baked biscuits, with a light wreathing of meadow mint. The character of the grain comes through quite clearly, and it’s distinctly different from the Myer Rye. But what’s here is not particularly interesting or well-integrated.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
80,Ontario Wheat Batch 2,50.0,Canadian,37,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of organic, single-field white whiskies from Toronto distillery. In 2013, summer rains imbued Ontario spring wheat with softer, nuttier, and more complex flavors than 2012. These show here on the nose as lemon oil, fragrant spring violets, and newly harvested grain. A sweet, spicy palate is alive with real lemons, yellow plums, fresh straw, and sweet, lingering white pepper. Mouth coating and big. (<em>Ontario only) </em>C$40/375 ml.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
80,J.R. Ewing Private Reserve 4 year old,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"A straightforward bourbon that takes few risks but also offers few rewards. You’ll find a mélange of orange, apricot, sweet corn, vanilla, soft spice and honey. Light, youthful finish, with a kiss of oak. Sourced whiskey.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
80,Braunstein Library Collection 13-2,46.0,Danish,147,"The Braunstein craft distillery and brewery lies southwest of Copenhagen at Køge Harbor. This one uses barley peated to a phenolic content of 60 ppm and boy, do you know it! Any balance of character is resoundingly bested by acrid aromas of charcoal sticks, sooty fireplaces, and blackened toast. The oily mouthfeel oozes cherry soda, bubblegum, maraschino, Ama’r Stang, and Band-Aids, with chicory on the finish. This needs better balance; at present, it’s like a pyroclastic cloud erupting from the glass. 795kr",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
80,Midnight Moon,40.0,Craft Whiskey,22,"Unaged, triple distilled spirit, produced and bottled at Piedmont Distillers in North Carolina. Clean nose with hints of unripe honeydew, bond paper, and wet crushed chalk. Very soft on the palate, clean, with no burn at all. Slippery-smooth, a tiny bit sweet. Tastes like good vodka, really; not much grain here at all. Easy to drink, but…where’s the excitement?",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
80,Palmetto Moonshine Corn Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,24,"Mason jar packaging makes for an awkward pour; had to be said. Nose is hot, with a fruity sweetness and fainter notes of grassy green corn, flowers, and rock. Clean and sweet, with more corn character here, along with other fresh grains. Not nasty, not bad, but seems to be mostly aimed as a base for Palmetto’s apple pie and peach flavors. Otherwise…it’s sweet, corn-tinged vodka.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
80,Grand Grizzly,40.0,Canadian,,"An all-rye grain mash yields this almost tequila-like whisky that was blended to tempt the agave-blessed Mexican palate. Hot, earthy, and somewhat muddy, with the black pepper signature of tequila, it gradually becomes sweet and creamy with vague hints of black licorice. Strong herbal undertones suggest dill pickles. Hard slatey rye grain softens into blue clay. The sintering heat lingers right to the end, as do earthiness and agave-like black pepper ¡Hola!<i> (Mexico only)</i> <em>99</em> Mexican pesos",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
80,Lord Calvert Canadian,40.0,Canadian,10,"Sweet creamy toffee, with hot and spicy undertones, builds gradually to a peak then fades into classic bitter pith. Caramels mute the hardness of rye grain as it, too fades in advancing waves of gingery pepper. Definitely a mixing whisky now, Lord Calvert tells one and all that their cocktail was made with wood-aged whisky. Hints of grassiness and dry white wine add breadth to a whisky that in days long past was intended to be sipped neat.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
80,Stauning Young Rye June 2013,,Danish,91,"It&#039;s the sheer chutzpah of these young whisky producers that I adore. They don&#039;t care. They&#039;re skate punks crashing through the whisky suburbs, flipping cartwheels and turning the world upside down. This isn&#039;t great, truth be told, but what nerve to try making a rye! And while it&#039;s hard to tell with this most difficult of grains, I reckon this will come off. Hickory, licorice, and spice are in place. Now we need balance. Watch this space. 495 Krone/500 ml",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
80,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glenallachie) 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"There is something very bedtime drink about this Glenallachie, without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night. It’s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder. The palate is simple, with some fresh apple, pear juice, and a lightly sour edge. The draff/malted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue. With water, pears come through, making it similar to a tequila blanco. All rather delicate. £63",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
80,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 29 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,275,"Quite hot on the nose, with a little oak on show here alongside garam masala. The effect is of dried fish and seaweed, Brazil nut and bread basket. It needs water. In the mouth it’s tense when neat, giving you the sense of it straining to express itself fully but being constricted by alcohol. Firm and bold, but even with water it’s a little too dry.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
80,Glencadam The Rather Delicate 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,48,"Fresh citrus notes and pear drops on the nose, plus a newly-opened packet of printer paper. The palate is quite full-bodied and fruity, with some white pepper. More citrus on the palate, with spicy, freshly-sawn wood. The finish is relatively long and fruity. Uncomplicated, but a good introduction to the brand. £30",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
80,Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Mortlach) 1989,,Single Malt Scotch,201,"There’s a Roman dish involving lamb cooked in milk, and this is it in alcohol form. A slightly peculiar lactic note rises and falls above the rich meatiness of the spirit. There’s a hit of pencil shavings, but with water it becomes cheesy. So much more straightforward on the tongue with good vinous weight, like an old Vin Jaune. It finishes with earthy tones. It’s just…odd. £125",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
80,Chichibu Port Pipe 2009,,Japanese,152,"Matured in 500-liter port pipes, the color is that of a Provence rosé wine. Young, but the oak is apparent. Though it’s slightly hot when neat, there is distinct raspberry and cranberry fruitiness, nettles, grass, and, with water, chalk. Sweet on the tip of the tongue, there are little glimpses of raspberry fool and some caramelized notes from the cask, but it’s not yet fully integrated. £95",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
80,Rod & Rifle Straight Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Green corn, cooked corn, roasted corn, all tumbling over each other in the nose. Very sweet, young bourbon without much drying from the oak, but no youthful fire. Tastes like a lower row barrel. Finish is also sweet. Not a lot of complexity. Sourced whiskey, from Dickel.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
80,Toronto Distillery Ontario Organic Wheat,50.0,Canadian,40,"Dry grain fills the air on first pour. This clear unaged whisky just gushes feed mill aromas. The all-wheat spirit is distilled from grain grown in a single Ontario field, then coarse-milled for making whisky. Sweet, creamy, and oh so peppery hot, it fades from citrus fruit and bitter black licorice to absolute nothingness. Our forefathers drank new make whisky. Let’s hope it was as tasty as this one.<i> (Ontario &amp; Washington, DC only.) </i>C$40/375 ml",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
80,Black Eagle,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,12,"Quite pale, looks more like scotch. Nose is hot, sweet, a bit minty. Hot in the mouth, thin, sweet, with flashy mint and corn. Finish is fiery, and a tad bitter with wood, especially bitey high in the mouth. Young, rough, and without the raunchy fullness that can justify youthful braggadocio. There are better bourbons for only a dollar or two more. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
80,Southshot,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,13,"Hot oak and bubble gum in the nose, with a slight solvent hit of fingernail polish. Light corn in the mouth, oaky bitterness, a flash of the polish, and pretty hot for 40&#37;. A very thin mouthfeel, not that

appealing. The nicest thing about it, though, is the finish, which is surprisingly smooth, sweet, and almost rich. You’d want to dump some cola and ice in here. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
80,Italian Single Malt White,40.0,Italian,40,"A single malt it may be, because it’s the product of one distillery, but a single grain it’s not. In fact, there are three malted grains in this, and that makes for a punchy, vibrant, fruity, and menthol-tinged new make spirit, but with a sweet cereal note and some distinctive spiciness from the rye. Different and interesting up to a point; very well made, but still new make spirit at the end of the day. €30",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
80,Port Askaig 30 year old Cask Strength,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The oldest of the new trio, here you can see how the smoke has become fully absorbed, accenting the peapod and spearmint, giving depth to the still-fresh ozonic elements. There are light levels of complexity, even a little chocolate. The tongue, when neat, goes deep into pear and apple, but it’s edgy. Adding water, however, shows the lack of oak integration. I’d want more from a whisky of this age (and price). £199",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
80,Port Askaig,,Single Malt Scotch,,"As with the 30 year old, here you get the sense of smoke being absorbed rather than being expressive. There’s not a lot of cask at work here—this has real minerality, and an oily brininess bringing to mind a hot outboard motor on a fishing trip. Halfway in a fire ignites, sending clouds of smoke forward, but then it dries too quickly. Good, but just not enough oak to give it depth and length. £80",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
80,Gibson’s Sterling,40.0,Canadian,,"This entry-level Gibson’s is cut from the same fine cloth as the exquisite Gibson’s 18 and their lavishly flavorful 12 year old. Immediately, rum and butter laced with spirit and hot pepper seep into sweet and sizzling rye spices. Then light berry-ish notes turn to Concord grapes, pear juice, and soft yellow apples, as bitter walnut skins counter rich maple ice cream. A slight waxiness lends a satisfying weight. (Canada only)C$26",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
80,Grandaddy Mimms,50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Dry, dusty corn with some fruit flashing around, and an odd aroma of cracked limestone. Simple corn spirit, lightly sweet and clean, not hot (especially for 50%), and a smooth finish. As the company notes, this is a spirit for mixing, but it’s a surprisingly easy sipper, if not overly rewarding. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
80,Hanyu 7 of Spades 1990 Cognac cask,,Japanese,,"Aged exclusively in cognac casks, here is Hanyu again showing its thick, earth-rooted solidity, even to the extent of some rootier elements showing. That said, on the nose, some water brings out jasmine, frangipani, and mace, with a light buttery note. It’s very spicy on the tongue: nutmeg mixed with bitter roots, but as with the Ace of Clubs, water just increases dryness. A bit too rigid for me. ¥14,000	",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
80,Elements of Islay Bw1 (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,85,"Though the color suggests good cask activity, the initial approach shows a dram that seems slightly unfocused and youthful. There are some kernel-like cereal elements and very little smokiness, with touches of salt and oil. The feeling is that it’s only starting to blossom — and there is a floral element — and has been bottled too early. It’s all very focused, lifted, and aromatic, but when compared to the Adelphi you can’t help but wonder whether the same distillery is involved.  ",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
80,Glen Moray Peated Spirit Batch #1 Cask 141,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Another Glen Moray, this time in a substantially different guise than normal. Yes, this is fresh, sweet, and malty — to be precise, draff-like — but there’s smoke as well, and a fairly decent belt of it. Young it may be — amazingly it’s less than 2 years old — but the palate, especially with water, is cleansing and with vanilla, good phenols, and orris-like dryness. Very intriguing. £18 (200 ml)",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
80,Alibi,45.0,American Blended Whiskey,,"Alibi is a new blended whiskey: 27.5% 3 year old straight whiskeys, 72.5% GNS. A new American blended whiskey? Give it a whiff: hot caramel, a bit of fruit, and store-brand vanilla. It’s hot in the mouth, sweet with more caramel and vanilla, fringed with cinnamon and oak. Not bad, but it’s squeezed at its $24 price by perfectly good straight bourbons.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
80,Brenne Estate Cask (Cask #264),40.0,French Whisky,,"When introducing new world whisky, I tell folks to treat it not as a scotch but as a totally different whisky. But how far can you go? The French have a “whisky” made with buckwheat — technically not a grain — and chestnuts. Now we have this. This is light, sweet, with flavored candy and fruit jelly; lots of pruney, grapey Cognac notes. There&#039;s the issue. Is it a nice drink? Yes. Is it really a whisky? It&#039;s up for debate.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
80,Ardbeg Galileo,49.0,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Released to celebrate the Ardbeg space mission, this is a mix of 1990 Ardbeg from bourbon and Marsala casks, and it’s the latter which make the running from the start. Earthy, with blackberry and fruitcake, and sooty peatiness in the background. While there’s a medicinal/herbal note with water, the palate has a damp wood edge. Fortified wine can work with peat, but here there’s a clash between distillery character and the Marsala cask. Sadly, a disappointment.",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
80,Belgian Owl Cask 4276140 5 year old 2012,,Belgian Whisky,,"Yep, you read that right. A whopping 76.1% ABV. Belgian Owl has matured its whisky in warm and brightly lit warehouses so the spirit sort of cooks. You have to add water and add water and add water until…darn it, you've gone too far. If you do manage to get it right—at about 46%—it offers nothing extra to what you get from the 46% version. Too much like hard work and really not worth the effort. ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
80,Copper Fox Single Malt Whisky,48.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Wood-smoked malt, a spirit aged in oak with fruitwood chips added makes for a distinctive, idiosyncratic whisky. Nose is warehouse reek, mellow fruitwood smoke, and sweet, light pipe tobacco, with a slight hint of cinnamon. Mouth is hot, but soft, with lots of malt and that unfamiliar flow of fruitwood smoke. Thin and edgy up front, but as the smoke spreads and the malt sweetens, it evolves. Finish is a bit abrupt.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
80,BenRiach Solstice 17 year old (Batch 2),50.0,Single Malt Scotch,93,"Or ‘Fumabat Porticus’ as it should be called—smoky whisky in a port cask—not that you need to be told that when you see the color. The port takes the upper hand on the nose, giving a layer of black raspberry, sloe, and cranberry sauce. The smoke hangs in the background. This juicy fruitiness carries through to the tongue where the smoke now adds much-required dry balance. The higher alcohol also stops it becoming too jammy. £59",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
80,Bunnahabhain ‘Over 12 year old’ Feis Ile 2012 bottling,,Single Malt Scotch,94,"Light gold in color, the roasted almond notes that start the nose show the influence of the amontillado sherry finish before your nose is filled with the contents of a spice merchant’s chest alongside, unusually, a light maritime note. Very gentle and clean in the mouth with sour plum and a generally amenable nature. More like this please, Burn Stewart! £60",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
80,Laphroaig PX cask,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,94,"A mix of bourbon and quarter casks finished in Pedro Ximenez, this new release is, initially, only for Travel Retail. The problem with finishing peaty whiskies is that all you can do is reduce the smoke, but here it’s done with as much subtlety as you can when dealing with PX. Think treacle scones, raisins, and tarry tobacco. A thick mid-palate gives an effect like an old-fashioned medicine. A sweet-hearted dragon smoldering in its seashore cave. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>) £60",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
80,Double Barrel Caol Ila/Tamdhu,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The weakest of the Double Barrel trio on offer, this has a slightly spirity nose with a somewhat unpleasant off note, but the taste promises more than the nose delivers. The oily, peaty Caol Ila is seemingly held in check by the Tamdhu on the one hand, while the fresh, zingy, sherbet-like characteristics of Tamdhu are tantalizingly faint. In the end, pepper and peat dominate.€40",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
80,Breakout Premium Rye Whiskey,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Interesting: “Bottled by The Tennessee Spirits Company, Pewaukee, WI.” Woody nose, spiked with dry rye spiciness: black pepper, dried mint. My, that’s hot. It’s a rye rocket, and the wood’s drying up every bit of sweet here, leaving my tongue wrinkly. A bit of water, though, and this is a much happier whiskey; softer, sweeter notes come out, and the mint cheers up. (sourced whiskey) ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
80,Troy and Sons Small Batch Moonshine,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Distilled from an almost extinct strain of heirloom corn (Crooked Creek), this is a fully aromatic white whiskey: fresh white corn, crisp apple, and pear float high over the liquid. A soft mouth—not overly hot—brings the fruit, but the corn is a solid underpinning. There’s a dry, almost mineral component to the finish. No flaws, interesting flavors, and nicely integrated for an unaged spirit. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
80,Vickers Brothers Premium Corn Whiskey,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Not a lot of details offered past the “Cane • Corn Spirit” and “aged in oak for 2 years” on the label, and talk of a “honey mixture.” Color is medium-amber; smell is thin, sweet, and lightly fruity. Not unpleasant in the mouth; candy-sweet, maybe a bit bland, and an ashy hint. The finish does have a little ‘bit-o-honey’ flavor that hangs high for a long time. Overall, not bad, but not real exciting either.  ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
80,Bruichladdich Octomore ‘Comus’ 4.2 2007 5 year old,61.0,Single Malt Scotch,200,"Comus is the name of a frankly terrifying English folk group who taps into the dark, pagan spirit underpinning that music. An apposite name then for the Laddie’s most heavily-peated variant. If you want to know what it’s like to stand beside a kiln, then sniff this, but the distillery’s sweetness is retained, here in the guise of pineapple and banana. The palate is like eucalyptus lozenges, with light maltiness before that Laddie thickness makes things even sweeter.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
80,Caol Ila Distillers Edition 1998,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The finish in question here is Muscatel casks and you can tell that from the start, as the nose is filled with a rich, sweet, and very pronounced dusky fruitiness — sloes and plums. The smoke as a result is diminished as are the grassy/bacony notes. While the smoke does emerge from its fruity bubble on the tongue, the effect is almost liqueur-like. It’s a very pleasing dram, but the question is, is it Caol Ila?",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
80,Tullamore Dew 12 Year Old Special Reserve,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this and out of context, its rounded, fruity, and sweet taste is perfectly acceptable. But it's standing in the company of giants, and when compared to the steady stream of world-class Irish whiskeys over the last year, this just doesn't cut it. The 12 years in oak don't seem to have added much to the story, the alcoholic strength means it lacks real bite, and the flavors are bland in this company. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
80,Royal Lochnagar Distillers Edition 1998,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of the newest of the Distillers Edition family. Here, Royal Lochnagar has been given its secondary resting period in Muscat casks. That nodule of sweetness in the 12 year old has been picked up and extended into a more perfumed world; think blueberry muffin and boysenberry jam. The slight sour/bitter note is a positive, but I think in this case that the finish dominates proceedings and needs to be scaled down a little. £48",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
80,Bastille Blended Whisky,40.0,Blended French Whisky,,"Described as &#039;French blended hand-crafted whisky hand-made and finished in French Limousin oak,&#039; this is a real weirdo. It&#039;s more interesting than many blends and quite likeable, but it tastes less of whisky and more like a thin Southern Comfort, with liqueur-like orange, some menthol, gentle spice, and other aromatics. Hard to believe nothing has been added.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
80,George Dickel Cascade Hollow,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,16,"Youthful, simple, and uncomplicated. Buttered corn, soft vanilla, honey, and bright fruit, with a kiss of spice. Fairly quick finish.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
80,Bowmore 10 year old Tempest (Batch 3),,Single Malt Scotch,80,"As cask strength examples of young Bowmore — sold at a very keen price — the small-batch Tempest range is already picking up a cult following. This third release does not disappoint in the smoke department, while the nose also shows some orange zest aromas. That said, it is a little restrained, showing its youth with a pea pod-like character on the palate, while its fruits are emerging but aren’t fully ripened. More of a strong breeze than a tempest. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
80,Caol Ila Moch,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Originally a one-off bottling for Friends of the Classic Malts, ‘Moch’ (Gaelic for dawn, though the association between daybreak and the dram is beyond me — one for the morning ‘skailk’ maybe?) appears to have taken the place of the Cask Strength expression. It shows a saline, seashell-like freshness, light smoke. and a pleasant mix of salami and grassiness. The palate is clean and intense with a continuation of that oyster liquor character. Great in a smoky Highball. £36",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
80, Mackmyra Moment Norrsken,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"Moment is a series of special one-off single malt whisky releases, and allows the distillery to experiment with cask types. Some of the whiskies, such as this one, take the distillery back to an earlier, more intense and difficult era. So here we have mushroomy, earthy whisky with damp autumn leaves, artichoke, tobacco, and salted fish in the mix. It's a full-on savory experience, and not one for the faint-hearted. SEK 1295",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
80,Thomson 10 year old,40.0,New Zealand,,"Thomson is a small, independent New Zealand whisky company with a limited amount of stock originally distilled at the Willowbank distillery, and this is as young as New Zealand whisky currently gets. One suspects it would have benefited from a couple more years, but its simple sugar and spice combo and rich citrus heart make it an uncomplicated but very drinkable session malt. It's a waltz of a whisky that kicks a bit at the death. NZ$85",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
80,Jura 10 Year Old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Despite close proximity to Islay, stylistically Jura make has far more in common with its Highland cousins. The entry level 10 year old variant offers resin, oil, cereal, and pine notes on the delicate nose. Comparatively light bodied, with malt and drying saltiness in the mouth, along with a hint of aniseed. The finish is malty and nutty, with more salt, plus just a wisp of smoke.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
80,Adelphi (distilled at Glenlivet) 1978 34 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,160,"Think of sponge fingers soaked in cream and you’re not far off the initial aroma. Add in light macadamia-like nuttiness, a drift of mint, and Glenlivet’s signature apple — core, not green. As it opens, it becomes woodier, like a brush pile. The palate has sweet, pure, pear-like fruit that initially keeps the oak in balance. It seems to need water, but when it’s added the oak takes over. Good, but a little tired. £102",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
80,High West Silver OMG Pure Rye,,Rye Whiskey,33,"Barely aged white whiskey. Huge new-make nose, soaked grain and green apple, then rye-driven mint and spice. Bursting spice and mint in the mouth, quick hot fireworks, long gripping finish; somewhat drying. Hot, but holds your attention. Lower distillation proof (134) leaves more room for flavor on this one, and some water makes it enjoyable...if I could just get past that new-make nose I can&#039;t help thinking of as “too young.”",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
80,Wemyss The Spice King 12 Year Old,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The least assertive of the Wemyss 12 year old range, and the most flighty. There's nothing wrong here, and the whisky's well-made and won't disappoint, but when you compare the spice hit here with what's on offer with other malts, this isn't shouting loudly enough. £35",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
80,Catoctin Creek Roundstone Rye,40.0,Rye Whiskey,,"Distilled from 100% organic rye. Very fresh, oily rye nose, bursts with rye spice fireworks. Tastes like a textbook example of 'what rye does in distillation.' Spicy, oily, hints of mint, with just a bit of vanilla from a month and a half in wood...which is where it fades, needing that barrel complexity. Catoctin Creek is making some nice, clean whiskey, a great start, and I do hope they're tucking some away for the long haul.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
80,Master of Malt Speyside Single Malt 40 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A similar story to the 30 year old. Despite a truly excellent nose, this time more sherry influences dominate: think of polished wood, damsons, and a little menthol/camphor and resinous oak. Once again, the palate seems to be slightly dumber than I’d want from a venerable whisky that should be about elegant, complex expression. It’s balanced, just a little faded. Again, maybe higher strength might have done the trick. £140",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
80,Delaware Phoenix Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Hot corn, vanilla, mint, and just a touch of oak spice; this one's been in the barrel under 12 months. Whoo, it's hot, even for 100 proof. All the right parts are here: corn, vanilla, wood, even some mint, and no serious off-flavors, but it's a rough road. Definitely needs some more time in the barrel, but that should do it some good. Gutsy stuff. Price is per 375ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
80,Leopold Bros. American Small Batch Whiskey,43.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"Corn pudding and ryespice nose, very plain-spoken, with just the barest hint of berries. Flavors of light custard, corn, rye, brown sugar, light maple, and vanilla ignite a fiery wash across the tongue, with a fairly hot finish. This is a delicate and subtle bourbon, one that would be lost if mixed with something too big, but rewarding when enjoyed neat. Nicely done. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
80,Armorik Original Edition,40.0,French Whisky,,"There are big similarities with this whisky and those being produced at nearby Glann ar Mor. The dominant flavors are soft and sweet, and there's a distinctly soft and feminine side to this single malt, which skips across the palate. There are floral and green fruit notes here, traces of oak, barley, and sweet spice, all very ordered. Not complicated maybe, but very well made indeed.  €20",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
80,Belgrove White Rye,40.0,Australian Whisky,,"Down in Tasmania they're about to start distilling a corn mash whiskey and a triple distilled Irish-style one, and here farmer and sand and ice sculptor Peter Bignell is using his own rye to distill spirit on a still he built himself. This is new white spirit made with 100 percent rye and bottled at 40%. It's more pastis than whiskey, a soft licorice and aniseed alcopop which is way too drinkable. A rising star. $AUS 99/500ml",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
80,Santis Edition Sigel,40.0,Swiss,,"Why is it that so many great beer-producing European nations, many of them with Germanic roots, didn't progress to whisky making? Appenzeller brewery makes this malt using old beer casks, and they have softened the edges of the malt and given it a liquid honey frame around which woody-earthy notes and unripe dates create an intriguing mix. A long, long way from the Alps to the Scottish Highlands, but a lofty malt nevertheless.  €45 ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
80,Glenburgie 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.



This distillery is located amongst the fertile barley-growing fields of the Laich O’Moray. Though modern in look, it actually dates back to 1810. This is a classic introduction to its fresh, zesty style, which plays an important role in the Ballantine’s blends. Think cut grass, green apple, pine, pear drops, and a whiff of freshly-starched linen. This energy carries on to the mouth where apple is the dominant flavor, along with green walnut and a zippy acidity. £34 ",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
80,Low Gap Whiskey (American Craft Whiskey Distillers),,White Whiskey,,"Distilled from “malted Bavarian hard wheat” on the still formerly used at Germain-Robin. Good pedigree; does it deliver? Bread/flour in the aroma, like a fresh bag of flour, with a fruity alcohol edge to it, the wheat tang I know from beer. In the mouth, it comes through as bread and crackers. It’s somewhat hot, but it’s a brandy/aromatic heat: vapor-producing. The finish pulls more grain in, finally. They’re aging some of this; should be a great whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
80,Marko K. Spirits Doubled & Twisted,,White Whiskey,,"Distilled from “bottle-ready IPA.” Sure is; the hops leap out of the glass, piney and pithy, a real west coast beer and whiskey experience in a glass. Quite a fat mouthfeel for 99 proof, a big oily thing that rolls around the tongue, making itself at home with flaring hop flavor — not really bitter — and an underlying sweetness. Bittering kicks in on the finish. An astonishing experience that really grows on you…but ultimately there’s a lack of depth. Price is per 1 liter.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2011
80,Milford 20 year old,43.0,New Zealand,,"This is from the stock of aged Willowbank whisky that  was marketed under the Milford label before ending up as whisky from Thomson. You following this? It’s sweet, with an attractive soft melon center, but sharp pepper kicks in and coats the mouth, staying forever. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
80,BenRiach Horizons 12 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,82,"Not satisfied with trying different levels of peating and cask types, the folks at BenRiach are also utilizing triple distillation. This expression has spent three years in oloroso sherry butts, although for me there’s more a mix of honey and cream, and light orchard fruits than any overt fruitcake. The palate is clean and fresh and lifted. Good energy. £50",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
80,Canadian Club Whisky,40.0,Canadian,,"Pale, almost peach color. Light aromas of caramel, sweet citrus. Tastes of sweet caramel, faint bite of oak on the end. Simple, but clean and pleasant. You’d have to be careful mixing this — it would get lost easily — but it should be nice on the rocks or with seltzer.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
80,Draymans Highveld,43.0,South African Whisky,,"The distillery makes big claims for this whisky, stressing that it shares the same high production values as Scotland, and the importance of altitude in the Highveld to maturation. This is the first whisky release from a Pretoria brewery, and it is fascinating. The nose is confused, but the palate is liqueur-like, with blackcurrant cordial and Vimto [a UK fruit-herb soda]. Its problem is its youth. It’s not yet fully integrated, and there are immature rootsy notes here, but it’s promising. €36 Currently not available in the U.S. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
80,Bainbridge Battle Point organic wheat whiskey,43.0,Wheat Whiskey,,"A small-barrel aged whiskey. The nose is sweet and fairly simple: cotton candy, wintergreen, faint menthol, and some heat. It’s hot in the mouth, too. The mint/wintergreen gives way to light caramel and sweet fudge; it’s even a bit sticky. There’s a need for more depth to balance the sweetness, and some more age to mellow the heat. More rough-edged than ‘big distiller’ whiskey at this point.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
80,Glenkinchie,,Single Malt Scotch,97,"Another whisky that will not disappoint fans of the brand, but it doesn’t do enough to bring any converts on board. The nose is fresh and sweet, with barley and ginger and not much else. The taste is perfectly acceptable, and at this strength better than the standard bottling. Water brings out a sweet malt and barley core, some gentle spice, and a rich sweetness.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
81,Creek Water American Whiskey,50.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),25,"Sweet kettle corn and caramel-covered nuts on the nose, along with a smoky and woody aroma—dry toasted wood on a fire. The palate is led by sugary grain and wood char, with caramel corn and grilled corn on the cob, along with a hint of wood spice. It’s cloying and sweet on the finish, yet retains strong oakiness. Distilled from a bourbon mash and “finished” with toasted wood chips using a proprietary technology.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
81,Cleveland Underground Bourbon Finished with Hickory Wood,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Grassy aromas mingle with white pepper, honeysuckle, jasmine, and newsprint on the nose. The palate rushes through sweet vanilla-cake and ripe fruit flavors, with strong oak and alcohol influence, to a finish that is mostly wood with some pleasant chocolate and herbal notes. Disjointed at times, but water helps bring it together.



<em>This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.</em>

Actual Time in Barrel: varies, but usually around 3 months;

Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using hickory wood pieces.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
81,Boatwright Single Barrel Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Grassy notes and damp hay define the aroma of this young bourbon, while the palate offers good citrus and orchard fruits. However, there is a varnish note and stalky green character that hold it back. Needs time.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
81,F.E.W. Single Malt,,Craft Whiskey,60,"Fresh and distinctly grain driven, like slurping warm breakfast cereal, but that malt purity also comes at the expense of complexity and development, with lots of grassy meadow, cut hay notes, that lead to a palate of husky grain and honeyed malt, before a finish sweet, young grass notes.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
81,Oregon Spirit Bottled in Bond Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,75,"Pleasantly aromatic of oranges and dusty oak, turning more oily, chewy, and nutty on the palate, with honeycomb intensity. However, the tannins are quite aggressive, suggesting green walnut hulls and wooden popsicle stick.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
81,American Barrels Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,30,"Soft, creamy, and corn-driven, with sweet stone fruit and char aromas up front. The palate delivers on the nose; simple, direct, and enjoyable, pleasantly soft and creamy, then turning slightly nutty with sweet praline sweetness and a touch of cocoa. While lacking in complexity and verve, it shows smoothness for a whiskey aged less than 2 years.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
81,Inchmurrin 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Soft and warm on the nose, with peaches in syrup, heather, hazelnut, and mild ginger. Quite full and richly fruity on the palate: apricots and more peaches, plus stronger ginger and a hint of spicy oak. Lingering in the sweet finish, with gentle spices.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
81,Kornog Sant Ivy 2016,,Single Malt French Whisky,106,"Lemon lozenges and chewy warm cookies, with muscular, brutish smoke characteristics; like standing too close to the open doors of a peat kiln. The palate begins with gooseberries; very sharp, sour, and acidic, the blistering alcohol rolling through like a steamroller, while ginger and pepper fly about like sparks off a grindstone. It is enjoyably mollified through dilution to suggest sponge cake, citrus, chocolate, and tobacco notes. The consummate Kornog can be divine, but this is hard core. €100",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
81,Painted Stave Diamond State Rye (batch 1),45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"The first legal rye from Delaware since Prohibition includes 65% rye and also 5% rye malt. Although showing some spirituous aromas of youth, this is one of the more precocious small barrel projects (10 gallon), with its sweet cinnamon candy and rye bread notes turning still spicier on the palate. Not terribly complex, but enjoyable.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
81,The Singleton of Glendullan Classic,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Glendullan has an unfortunate moniker. Any whisky with ‘dull’ in the middle of its name will always struggle in English-speaking markets. It’s a shame, because it’s always delivered a gentle, sweet, lightly fruity/estery style, making it an ideal lunchtime dram. This ticks all those boxes. Green apples are there, as is cinnamon, alongside a racy acidity before water brings out more scented aromas. The finish is short, but it does its job as an easy-drinking, everyday malt. <em>(Travel Retail exclusive)</em>",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
81,Wood’s High Mountain Tenderfoot (Batch 29),45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Despite the orange-amber color, green, stalky corn husk and bramble notes dominate this youngster, with secondary flavors of fruitwood smoke and warm cereal. The flavors are beginning to evolve nicely on the palate, as the fresh malt meets lots of dark chocolate before a savory snap of green stick returns on the finish. Malted barley, malted rye, and malted wheat.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
81,Bib and Tucker Small Batch 6 year old,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"With its straw color, this looks nothing like a 6 year old, but its aroma and taste justify the age statement. Caramel-covered popcorn, cooked grains, Nutella, honey, and toasted rye bread. No one flavor overpowers another as an assortment of sweet and spice project over a chewy mouthfeel. The medium finish shows decent caramel. This is nice, but doesn’t wow the palate. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
81,Palm Ridge Rye Whiskey,50.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Starts off quite confectionary, with sweet top notes of vanilla, crème caramel, and violets. The palate flaunts its brash youth, showing lots of primary, new make whiskey character, while carrying its 100 proof surprisingly well for such a young whiskey (aged less than 1 year), as the cereal grain, cinnamon spice, generous sweetness, and charcoal power through the palate. Young, potent, and unapologetic.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
81,Willie’s Genuine,40.0,Canadian,28,"Willie Blazer imports 100% rye whisky from Alberta, then brings it to bottling strength at his Ennis, Montana distillery with water from the nearby Madison River. Canadian whisky figured large in the history of the West and Willie’s is a local bestseller. Caramel and rye spices on the nose, toast and plum jam, sweet yet bracing spices, a long, lovely glow deep in your chest. A simple sipper or a monster mixer with cloves, fruitcake, white pepper, and gentle pithiness.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
81,Bruichladdich Laddie Eight 8 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Another Travel Retail exclusive, and while you might expect something delicate given the age statement, what is delivered is a thick, buttery/creamy opening that, for a second, teeters on the brink of sourness then pulls back to be more like ricotta cheese. It then settles into vanilla, floral notes, white chocolate, and sweet barley. The palate is thick once again, with lemon cheesecake giving a needed clean acidity. Quite a bulky youngster that’s best with water. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive) £45</em>",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
81,Deanston Organic 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,115,"Deanston distillery has released its first organic single malt, aged for 15 years in new oak barrels. It is non-chill filtered.  Stem ginger, white pepper, cloves, and vanilla on the nose. The palate is rich with intensely sweet early fruit notes, honey, more ginger, and now black pepper. Becoming nuttier and slightly metallic in the finish with spicy oak and a hint of aniseed. <em>(Germany and Travel Retail) £80</em>",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
81,Singleton of Glen Ord 15 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,82,"Released in Taiwan in 2010, 15 year old Singleton of Glen Ord offers deep, smooth sherry and ginger notes on the nose. There’s vanilla, cocktail cherries, orange, malt, and dark chocolate on the palate. Long in the fruity then drying finish, cocoa powder, and finally, rather bitter oak. RM329",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
81,Singleton of Glen Ord 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,61,"Launched in southeast Asia in 2006, 12 year old Glen Ord boasts a nose that is sweet and gingery, with toffee, a hint of tangerine, along with vanilla, sherry, and oriental spices. The palate mirrors the nose with more spice, then chocolate, and milky coffee. Finally, quite drying. RM247",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
81,Ballantine’s Finest,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,21,"A pleasant nose of light caramel, dried orange rind, butterscotch, sweet grain, and a lick of bonfire smoke, yet it’s like the volume has been dialed down to three. Delicate, to the point of shyness. Sweet barley, concentrated orange, a low rumble of spice, and the grain sings through. Accessible, well structured, and light-textured, leading to a finish of brown sugar around the gums, although it has a stronger grain character than many in its price range.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
81,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at North British) 21 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,109,"Did you hear that this distillery produced its 2.5 billionth liter of alcohol in 2015? This example from a refill hoggie has a floral bouquet, with a nose of snapped fingers of vanilla shortbread, butter frosting, and Angel Delight. An oily texture with flavors reminiscent of popcorn, turns to caramel, vanilla, parkin, and gingersnaps. There are some growling base notes of peppercorn, but it ends on a singed popcorn note. Sticky nougat and toasted corn chips on the finish. (294 bottles) £76",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
81,Chicago Distilling Blind Tiger Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Fresh oak nose, with hard candies and bitter grass notes. Much less oaky on the tongue, but the hard candies—spicy-sweet, a bit hot—burst in the mouth, leading down to a warm, pastry-sweet finish with a wreathing of ashes. Boozy and warm, and a bit simple, but quite drinkable for a young bourbon.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
81,Belgian Dark Strong Style,45.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Nose is tight, closed, what’s there is like a raisin bun; softly sweet pastry and dried fruit. Gentle in the mouth, warming but not hot; still like the pastry, but with oak framing and some nuts and a hint of anise. (375 ml.)",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
81,Old Forester Signature,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"Brown-Forman has made Old Forester since 1870. It sure is easy on the eyes: beautiful tawny hues against the light of sunset. Think Southern bakery. Lots of caramel, vanilla, freshly baked cornbread, nutmeg, cherry pie, and cocoa. Then add the spiciness. These delicious flavors don’t last long, making me wonder how it would fare with just a couple more years in the barrel.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
81,Inchmurrin Madeira Finish,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"A soft, perfumed nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, and a lightly spiced background. Voluptuous and initially very sweet on the palate, with malt and almonds, then ginger and chili kick in. Lively spices and fruit-and-nut chocolate continue through the lengthy and ultimately dry finish. £55",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
81,Deveron 18 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,98,"Formerly marketed as Glen Deveron and now rechristened the Deveron as part of owner John Dewar &amp; Sons’ Last Great Malts initiative, this 18 year old is the oldest of three releases on offer.  Oily on the nose, with apricots, sultanas, and toffee. Dark spices merge with sweet apples, walnuts, and a hint of chewing tobacco on the palate. Ginger and pepper in the lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
81,Montgomery Early Release Straight Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"Beautiful little bottle and label. 100% rye, aged 2 years in 53-gallon heavy char oak barrels. Smells right: rye spice, orange candies, and oaky vanilla. Light body, quite hot, and the sweetness comes through, but the rye really turns it up as the liquid spreads on the tongue and warms. Some plastic hints high in the mouth. Promising, but not there yet; part of the problem with big barrels.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
81,Royal Crest,40.0,Canadian,25,"Fairly simple, with strong butterscotch, hints of humbugs, burnt sugar, and red fruits. Lovely intro though, with petrichor: the vaguely vegetal scent of new rain and old punky logs. Maturation in once-used bourbon barrels leaves a soft, smooth mouthfeel that says “session whisky,” This soon becomes chewy then juicy, as increasingly hot pepper moves to the fore. Finishes with pleasing, fading, bitter citrus pith.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
81,Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Miltonduff,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"A light, oily nose, a little nutty, baked apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, and malt biscuits. There are seductive dark spices and cooked fruit, almost savory, like lifting the lid on a tagine. A thinner mouthfeel showing some lime zest before a warm, enveloping glow of malt sweetness, gentle spice, toffee, raisin, and char emerges. Savory, peppery finish. Like nightfall, it gets darker the longer you contemplate it. With water, sweeter with more candied citrus as honeys materialize.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
81,Darkness! (distilled at Invergordon) 23 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,117,"Cometh the night. Shadows veil a whisky hewn from the cold lands in the north. A whisky of black cherry, crème de prune, <em>rancio</em>, balsamic, and salt, for it has known a mythical chimera cask; half Pedro Ximénez, half <em>oloroso</em> wood. The magical, syrupy texture foretells of passion fruit, fig, cherry, and raisins, but prophesizes that cask char will dominate the swallow. Dark forces swamp the quest for grain, though there is taste, hope, and nourishment for the journey ahead. £77",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
81,"Duncan Taylor, Octave (distilled at Aultmore) 2008",,Single Malt Scotch,82,"The recent official release of Aultmore means that malt lovers are finally aware of the distillery’s intense grassy/perfumed character, and it is these characters which are prominent here, alongside a very light sherried note in the background. There appears to be real complexity on the nose for such a young example, but water shows this to be the influence of the octave cask, which unravels slightly when water is added. Have it neat, and enjoy it a lot. £54",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
81,Ethan Knoll 8 year old,40.0,Canadian,17,"A mild nose with hints of caramel and dry grasses just vaguely suggests the flavors that wait in the glass. The sweetness of navel oranges and slow-developing peppery notes lead into the classic Canadian combination of caramel, cloves, ginger, and white pepper. Earthy vegetal tones, almost like riverweeds, and a strong but pleasant bitterness are glazed with creamy Mackintosh caramel. Dusty grain and pepper fade quickly in a shortish finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
81,Douglas Laing 15 year old Old Particular (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,153,"Bowmore in unusually oily guise here, with linseed oil, hot seashells, background water mint, completely integrated smoke, and a cooling note that brings to mind a lido (without any chlorine, I hasten to add). The palate has a limey lift which flows into a quite thick, creamy/oaty mid-palate, with the smoke bedding itself on the tongue. Smoky and mineralic on the finish. Water makes it even more gentle. A light expression for the early morning. £98",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
81,William Grant Rare Cask Reserves The Annasach Reserve 25 year old,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,340,"William Grant &amp; Sons Rare Cask Reserves are micro-blends created jointly by Brian Kinsman and various liquor store proprietors, drawing on a choice of over 40 different single malts (importantly, not Glenfiddich or Balvenie). Quite herbal, with tarragon, cilantro, boiled candies, and unripe plums. A slow starter; vegetal notes yield to fudge, milk chocolate, orange, and maltiness, with pepper, oak, and spices in the latter phases. Stocked in only five U.S. retailers.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
81,Kinsey 7 year old,,Miscellaneous,40,"Smells kind of…Canadian. Light caramel, sweet candy, and a bit of oak. Light and sweet on entry; not cloying, with some hints of vanilla and fresh-sawn cedar. Body seems to thicken as it hits the tongue, and the finish spreads and hangs: sweet, with that very light cedary note. Simple, sweet, but not overly complex. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
81,Five & 20 (SB)2RW,45.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"The “(SB)<sup>2</sup>RW” stands for “small batch small barrel rye whiskey.” Smells like it: small barrel, fresh-cut oak smell, clove cigarettes, and a fair amount of heat. A bit thin on the tongue, with a medicinal bite of rye grass, warming heat, and some sweetness, and the medicinal part expands into the finish.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
81,Wild Weasel Single Cask (cask #1),46.0,Belgian Whisky,65,"The broad grin on the face of Mike Janssen speaks volumes about his enthusiasm for the beers and spirits he produces at the Wilderen brewery-distillery. This first cask from 2011 has a young, grassy, and herbal nose, with orange peel, artichoke, and delicate black tea. Lithe yet warming flavors of citrus, pleasant barley notes, pepper, spice, and ginger, but with creeping vegetal notes. It still needs taming but it’s early days. Ginger, pepper, and celery on the finish. (<em>300 bottles)</em> €60",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
81,Jameson Caskmates Stout Edition,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,48,"Cork’s Franciscan Well brewery borrowed some whiskey casks, but now Jameson has taken them back to make Irish whiskey aged in craft stout barrels. On the nose, roasted coffee beans, 70% chocolate, green apples, juicy cantaloupe, and a buzz of hops. The thick, creamy mouthfeel tastes of stout, with strong chocolate and coffee notes and a tight, spicy finish. Perplexingly experimental in results. A whiskey for stout drinkers? A stout for whiskey drinkers? Incomparable to other Jameson. Funny peculiar. €45",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
81,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenburgie) 7 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"Pale straw. An upfront and quite aromatic nose with hints of a florist’s shop—stems and blooms—with an underpinning of malt. A little gawky perhaps, which water accentuates. The palate, when neat, is clean and mixes those flowers and some stewed apple. There’s a little green chili heat (even when diluted). A punchy little number. £36",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
81,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Bowmore) 15 year old 1999 (cask #350),,Single Malt Scotch,155,"Nosing this whisky, you&#039;d never guess just how fruity it is, with barnyard hay, dry malt, honey, and light smoke. On the palate, however, the fruit is unmistakable with giant mango and apple. The mid-palate takes a sharp left turn into smoke and salt, but the mango just won&#039;t let go. A very dry, smoky finish is too dry, making the case against release at this ABV. An oddball whisky that will probably only appeal to a very narrow audience. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
81,Two James Rye Dog,,Craft Whiskey,49,"A 100% rye unaged “white whiskey.” Nose is fruity—pear, apple, black raspberry—and peppery, with a mineral edge to it, like fresh-cracked stone. Creamy sweet mouth, repeating the fruits in half-voice, with a sharp alcoholic heat. Sweetness makes me curious about the fermentation attenuation…but this would be good with seltzer.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
81,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Sonoma-Cutrer Finish,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Finished in pinot noir barrels. A very fruit-forward whiskey. I love bourbon, and I love pinot noir, but the wine influence is very intense and, to me, the flavors don’t integrate well. Cherries, red raspberry, and red currant dominate, along with a coating of caramel. Cinnamon and clove struggle to emerge from underneath it all. Sweet, fruity finish. Bonus points for uniqueness, but a bit overdone with the wine influence.",John Hansell,Spring 2015
81,Fettercairn Fasque,42.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"While its regular stablemate Fior contains a proportion of peated malt, Fasque is unpeated, and the best comparison is with the now-discontinued 12 year old ‘1824’ house bottling. The nose is fragrant, with sherry, cherries, and vanilla. Relatively full-bodied, with a rich, spicy palate, focusing on Jaffa oranges and dark chocolate. It dries quite quickly to black coffee and spicy licorice, which linger in the mouth, along with a note of toffee. £35",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
81,Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 20 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,134,"Scooped-out spaghetti squash, whole red bird’s eye chilies, celery tops, and country ham. It is redolent of sugary-sweet candies like Spangles (from the 1970s). Light and delicate initially, moving into phases of vanilla sponge, dried raspberry, and peppery spices, then the vegetal notes grow larger in the later phases. An enjoyable effort from refill cask #10439, but it fizzles out, leaving a finish of light pepperiness, heat, and sodden newspapers. £88",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
81,Highwood Rye,40.0,Canadian,21,"Creamy butterscotch soothes the blazing hot spices of this archetypal Canadian mixing whisky. Fresh kiwi fruit and lime fragrances add dimension to a sweet, glowing middle, then fade on a long toffeeish finish that finally slips into slight hints of bitter grapefruit pith. A sweet, simple, and fruity session whisky that you could sip neat all evening, or over ice at a sunny poolside. A mixer, yes, and a sipper too. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$26",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
81,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at BenRiach) 24 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,146,"Very fresh and quite light in color, suggestive of only light cask conversation. BenRiach’s fruits are there with hints of apricot, even some gooseberry. Very light malty background, and then a whiff of witch hazel. In time, it sweetens into banana and pineapple. The palate is clean, though pretty hot, with that mature BenRiach fizzy spiciness on the back palate. Can’t help but feel that this would have been a great 30 year old. £95",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
81,Wyoming Small Batch Bourbon,44.0,Craft Whiskey,43,"Nose is a bit perfumed, like doilies at grandma&#039;s house, with grain, grass, and meadow notes. Flavor is minty, rye-bitter, and penetrating; finish is sweet and hot, with more grassiness. Powerful rye influence; not much corn, and that perfume note is odd, but the rye is gripping.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
81,Highland Queen 8 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,56,"At 8 years old, there are stiff caramels, malt, oatcakes, Genoise sponge, and zested clementines on the nose. It doesn’t stint on flavor when it comes to the taste, bringing dried fig rolls, chewy toffee, Aunt Sally pralines, walnuts, and chocolate ganache to the party. It’s driven by dry fruit rather than sweetness, and there is a bitter edge to the swallow that persists into the finish. £35",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
81,J.R. Revelry Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,32,"Very sweet and simple aroma, like plain jelly beans, with only a whisper of the heat you’d expect at 45%. Better on the tongue; proper heat, some cornpone, a bed of oak. Smooth, good balance, good finish. Nothing stands out, but nicely made. Loses points on the nose, and typifies the Small Producer Dilemma: why bottle a good bourbon? Beam and Heaven Hill do that already, cheaper than you ever will. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
81,Tullamore Dew Phoenix,55.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,75,"Aptly named after an inferno from an 18<sup>th</sup> century hot air balloon tragedy. Kaboom! The alcohol singes the nasal cavities, baying for you to succumb, but there is underlying maltiness, tight currants, leather bootlaces, allspice, cherry, stewed apples, and damp warehouses. To taste: fire in the hole! At full power, it strafes the taste buds into submission, leaving them numb and cowering for the abatement of the peppery, dry finish. Brawn vanquishes subtlety. Douse liberally.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
81,Monarch of the Glen,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,12,"Aromas of liquid honey, light toffee, dried apple, and satsuma peel. There is an initial citric attack, but when the flare dies down, a residual bitterness cuts through the underlying creaminess and caramel. Sure, its component whiskies lack substance and grip, but there is some flavor progression through to an enjoyable piquancy around the gums. The finish is a nippy buzz of peel and heather honey. Simple, uncomplicated, but for the price there’s plenty to like here.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
81,Whipnose,47.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"A Seven Stills and Pacific Brewing Laboratory collaboration: a distilled double IPA. Broiled grapefruit and caramel, with a razory lightness, but a bit muddled. Flavors of sweet malt and maple pierced in a needle-row with bitter hop resins, pine, pith; malt/hop/malt/hop comes in quick waves. Like some double IPAs, this is a blunt instrument that simply walks up and wallops you with hops and malt; neither subtle nor particularly complex. Hop fans may well love it; others will not. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
81,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 90,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Light in body, with soft fruit, graham cracker, and delicate honey. Oak tannin, leather, and prickly spice kick in mid-palate, but there’s not enough body and sweet notes to balance it.  Warm, spicy finish. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
81,Jack Daniel’s Rested Tennessee Rye,40.0,Rye Whiskey,50,"Continuing progress on Jack Daniel’s rye whiskey; this one is 2 years old and labeled “straight.” Pale amber. New make sharpness, sawn oak, hard candy, and a flip of cinnamon bark: driven, simple, insistent nose. Thin on the palate: sweet, with an oily overlay of bitter grass and grainy flatness. A dry, contracting finish. Not flawed, but not particularly pleasant, either. Someone tell Jack; craft distillers get $50 for young rye because they’re small. JD should be half that.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
81,Old Blowhard 26 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"The most intense of the Orphan Barrel initial release.  Very robust, with leather, tobacco, and roasted nuts. Quite spicy and resinous too. Toffee, maple syrup, and caramel struggle to soothe all this robustness, but the oak maintains the upper hand.  A <em>digestif</em>, perhaps, after a large meal? Unless you are purchasing for a piece of bourbon history, my advice would be to try it before you buy because, while complex, it is also quite woody.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
81,Catskill Most Righteous Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,30,"Simple nose of corn, oak, cinnamon candy, and ash. Candy sweet, grainy, still simple, and a bit thin; increasingly hot at the end. Needs more breadth and depth, but there’s nothing seriously flawed. I’d characterize this as a good flyweight boxer caught in a cruiserweight bout; nice footwork, solid performance, and dealing some good hits, but the bigger, older bourbons give it a palate-pounding. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
81,Fary Lochan Efterår Batch #01,48.0,Danish,273,"This 3 year old whisky comes from Denmark’s smallest distillery, where Jens-Erik Jørgensen has invested in a bulbous pot still from Forsyths, Scotland. I found barley sugar, mashing malt, risen loaves, vanilla, and fruity esters reminiscent of boiled sweets. The warming flavors begin with orange candies and clove, but it bucks like a wild stallion before settling to divulge a hint of licorice and cayenne pepper. A dry and sudden finish. Promising, but needs time to mellow. €200",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
81,Canada Gold,40.0,Canadian,22,"Whisky maker John Hall says value whiskies save used barrels from being wasted. Study the label and you’ll find this lush mixer hails from Hall’s Forty Creek distillery. Sweet voluptuous butterscotch and corn syrup slather peppery heat and the mildest tannins. The pepper turns ticklish on the roof of your mouth until charred wood, burned toffee, and vanilla custard flow over it. Simple but very sippable, it’s a bit luxurious for a mixing whisky. (<i>Canada only) </i>C$24",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
81,Hudson Maple Cask Rye,46.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,41,"Rye whiskey aged in casks used to age maple syrup. As penetrating an aroma as maple is, it’s very subtle here. The nose is rye whiskey—spicy, oily, bitter/minty—with just the barest hint of maple. The maple peeps up mid-palate for a sweet turn and lingers into the finish. I need to be convinced of the attraction; the maple and rye jar a bit when jammed together. And the price—$82 for 750 ml—seems crazy. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
81,Gooderham’s Bonded Stock,40.0,Canadian,10,"Bonded Stock was a Gooderham and Worts brand until Harry Hatch moved production to Windsor during Prohibition. Dry grain with hints of bicycle tires on the nose become barley sugar and fiery pepper on the palate. Simple with a delicate balance of hot ginger, licorice root, spearmint, savory herbs, watery caramel, and mild ripe fruit, ending with a refreshing bitter tinge. Old-time hard-rye mixing whisky, but go ahead, sneak a wee sip<i>.</i>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
81,Laird of Findlay,40.0,Canadian,63,"For years, about half a dozen large oak barrels of malt spirit sat ignored against the wall of the shop at Okanagan distillery in Vernon, BC. Fruit spirit is their main product. Finally, those barrels have been disgorged and blended into a fruit-forward single malt that tilts and dips like a butterfly in flight. Ripe cherries and dried apricots flit through Kraft caramels and green apple Twizzlers into a long, glowing sunset of hot spices and floral breezes. C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
81,Douglas Laing Scallywag,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,75,"Douglas Laing follows up its award winning, Islay-soaked Big Peat with this, a sherried Speyside whisky. Just as Big Peat looks like Captain Haddock from Tintin, Scallywag on the label is a dead ringer for Snowy, though the official story is different. Anyway, this whisky isn&#039;t a patch on the Islay monster. Rootsy green salad malt is only partially rescued by the trademark Christmas cake and stewed fruits. Likeable, but not a classic. £45",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
81,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Allt-a-Bhainne) 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,108,"Not often seen as a single bottling, here we have Speyside’s modernist distillery in typically delicate guise, with plenty of subtle florals (think hyacinth and daffodils), something which is amplified with water. Imagine a cool day in early spring and you are pretty much there. The mouth is clean and fresh, with a little acidity. Water doesn’t damage the palate delivery, but neither does it particularly enhance things. A sorbet rather than a meal. £65",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
81,JP Wiser,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,21,"Burnt caramel, sweet—almost candied—but not cloying, the whisky quickly develops fiery blasts of pepper that linger long on the sides of your tongue. As the heat builds, caramel melts into barley sugar, which in turn fades into bitter citrus pith. Flinty hard rye and vague barrel tones never let us forget that this is whisky: whisky enhanced with vanilla and spices that a probing palate might have found anyway in the unflavored dram.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
81,Spirit Hound White Dog Moonshine,45.0,Craft Whiskey,25,"All local Colorado malt, with a little peat-smoked malt. Unaged. No smoke on the nose; fresh, a bit feinty, wet and juicy melon, a hint of cardamom. Smoke is there as it hits the tongue, immediate but gentle. Spirit tastes much cleaner than it smells. Hot on the tongue, prickly. More melon and spice on the finish, a bit creamy. Not a bad white, but quite pricey. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
81,Inchmurrin 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,138,"This is the oldest expression of Inchmurrin to be released by Loch Lomond, who make it in their highly versatile distillery at

Alexandria. Brittle toffee and cod liver oil on the nose, with vanilla and a whiff of Jaffa oranges. Smooth and full on the palate, more substantial and sophisticated than the younger Inchmurrin variants. The fruits are now more citric. Lengthy and unctuous in the finish, with more citrus fruit, gentle spice, and a touch of oak. £90",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
81,Singleton of Dufftown Reserve Collection Trinité,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Full-bodied and sweet on the nose, mixing burlap, bran, fruit cake, hazelnut purée, malt

extract; with water it becomes fresher and almond-like with a touch of

greengage plum. The palate has a soft feel, with the thickness displayed in the

nose alongside plums and crystallized ginger. It’s just a little flabby. I’d

like a bit more freshness or grip. The finish is nutty and rich. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive) </i>£51/1 liter<b> </b>",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
81,Sir Edward’s Blended Whisky,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,14,"From the perfumed nose to the sweet and short finish, this blend doesn’t really put a foot wrong, but it’s shy and unadventurous.

Clearly well made, well balanced, and quite acceptable, it has a perfumed black currant sherbet nose, some slight but enjoyable blueberry, grape, and prune notes and a soft sweet conclusion. On its own, all fine: but it gets lost when in company.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
81,Winchester Small Batch,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Oak, and some candy-like sweetness, and alcohol heat…and not much else. A shy nose for a bourbon. Very hot in the mouth,

somewhat two-dimensional corn and oak, just put together without anything else around them. A pretty simple whiskey, with a slightly cloying finish. Nothing really flawed, just nothing really standing out, either. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
81,Port Askaig 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A trio of new expressions of what has become an established Islay brand. This one has a vibrant, edgy opening, almost like a burning lawnmower box, mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil), white tea, and, in time, the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. The palate is broad, and though light, the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt, lime, and smoke all begin to build. A little hard, but pleasantly bracing.£44 ",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
81,Fitch’s Goat 100% Corn Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,,"Sweet and a bit funky; maybe a wisp of smoke, maybe some green cornstalk, and some mint/vanilla. Rippling and vibrant in the mouth, hot and bold, and not candy-sweet at all, more like fuel-injected cornbread with a splash of burning mint eau de vie across the top. Or maybe that’s just the AC/DC talking; maybe I should review to Mozart. Not bad, but I think I like the simpler unaged version.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
81,Windsor Canadian,40.0,Canadian,,"Typical rye spices bathe in rich, smooth caramels and burnt sugar, with a gingery cayenne burn. Real black pepper engulfs cloves and cinnamon in a fiery and vibrant display, while vague tones of milk chocolate gently cool things down. Then an oiliness and mouth-filling richness sweep over a tinge of bitter herbal elixir and, yes, sawdust. This classic high-rye whisky from Alberta Distillers brings suggestions of dark fruit to an underlying nuttiness. ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
81,Hanyu Ace of Clubs 2000,,Japanese,,"Ichiro loves Japanese oak (mizunara) and here’s a finished example. You need water, however, to be able to discern those characteristic incense notes. Without it, you’re in a world of vanilla and resin. The neat palate is hot but firm, with some red fruits and an allspice note. Water is needed, and does allow a fresh acidity to come through on the finish; sadly it also adds tannic bitterness. A tricky balancing act. ¥9,000",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
81,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Four Wood,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Aged in American oak, and then finished in maple, sherry, and portwood. The nose is intriguing and entertaining, but the palate loses me. At the beginning, it’s sweet to the point of bordering on cloying, and then there’s an emergence of flavors (wood spice, stewed fruit, caramel, etc.) that turns very busy and lacks integration. The flavors just don’t play well with each other. To me, the whiskey is trying too hard to impress and achieves the opposite.",John Hansell,Spring 2013
81,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Caol Ila) 16 year old 1996,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Initially what we have are classic Caol Ila notes: cod liver oil, soft pear-like fruits, and a glimpse of lobster cooked in sea water. It’s not so much smoky as ozonic and, though it seems a little exposed with water, there’s a squeeze of lemon (for the lobster, maybe). On the tongue there’s a light ashy note before the mouth is slowly filled. Any smoke is in check and understated. This is about citric freshness and salt. £70",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
81,Glenfiddich 125th Anniversary,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,109,"Bottled for this auspicious occasion, this is a Glenfiddich that confounds people’s expectations by being smoky, not from casks (à la Caoran) but the distillate. Fresh, with a nose that brings to mind eating apples and hazelnuts around a late summer bonfire; the smoke seems in charge. On the palate, the reverse happens, with the fruits being thrust forward and the smoke only emerging on the finish. It’s vibrant and needs water, and is a lot of fun. Happy Birthday! (<em>Travel Retail and distillery shop exclusive</em>)£70",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
81,Charbay R5 French Oak Aged,,Craft Whiskey,,"Take the Charbay R5 Clear and add some vanilla and toast notes: interesting. The flavors…on first sip, the mellowing richness of the oak makes for a nice entry. But the wood blunts the zip of the hoppy beer wash without adding enough to compensate for the loss, and makes for a hotter finish. It’s still interesting, but the wood gets in the way of what this can be. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
81,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Aultmore) 20 year old 1982,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Aultmore is part of the Dewar’s stable and another of Speyside’s forgotten light brigade. Here is a noseful of esters: bubblegum, pineapple, pink grapefruit, strawberries, and icing sugar. Visions of “Legally Blonde” flash through the mind. The palate is equally energetic, though with little cask influence it’s a bit gawky and slightly green, especially with water, suggesting that another year wouldn’t have done it any harm. Still, all very lovely.  £100",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
81,Berry Bros. & Rudd (distilled at Glen Moray) 21 year old 1991,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Thanks to the suicidal pricing policy of its previous owner, Glen Moray has been considered nothing more than a bargain basement malt, but at its best it is a very sweet, lightly malty dram. This is as soft as a lemon cream bun in a sunlit baker’s shop. Water brings out banana chews while the tongue brings to mind a picnic with baked scones and apricot jam. The only negative is slightly needling alcohol, so dilute and drink quickly. £72",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
81,Chichibu The Floor Malted 3 year old,,Japanese,,"Another work in progress from the ever-enterprising Ichiro Akuto. This is made from barley that was malted by him and his team in Norfolk. Unusually for a Japanese malt, the aroma is, yes, malty, but it is more chaff-like than nutty. Chichibu’s floral element is there alongside grape must, verjus, and herbs. The palate is a fascinating mix of the very sweet with balancing dry and sour notes. A distillery that’s growing up fast. £90",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
81,Taketsuru 12 year old,40.0,Japanese,,"“At last!” they cry. Anchor Distilling is bringing in whiskies from Nikka. I taunted you with the first of the initial brace in 2010, the exemplary Yoichi 15 year old (a hefty 95 points). The second is the firm’s vatted malt, Taketsuru 12 year old. A mix of Yoichi and Miyagikyo distillates, it is the latter which is to the fore here: a honey-laden mix of cut flowers, persimmon, vanilla, and apple. More are on their way.  ",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
81,Wiser’s Spiced Whisky Vanilla,43.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,28,"Pink cotton candy and hot caramel sauce on a simple nose turn to rich burnt toffee and invigorating hot chili pepper on the palate, followed by savory herbs. The herbal tones quickly turn pleasantly bitter before fading into the barest suggestion of dry oak. Tingling peppery heat lingers right to the end. A hot, spicy version of Wiser’s Deluxe with the rye elements boosted by added vanilla. (Canada only) C$28",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
81,Giant French Oak Barrel 23 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Much more oak influence than its younger sibling. That lovely sweetness of the 19 year old Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel bottling is there at the beginning, but it’s quickly overtaken by oak spice, leather, and tannin notes. This one was left in the barrel a bit longer than I would prefer. If you like a wood-driven whiskey, then consider trying it. But if it’s balance you desire, look elsewhere.  Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
81,Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Aged 6 to 7 months in quarter barrels. Sharpish, oaky nose with a sweet grain/golden syrup backing. Spirity in the mouth, with a big slap of young oak up front that quickly subsides, yielding sweet corn muffin, white pepper, and dry cocoa that linger into the finish. Hot, but worth the burn. Some nice components here; age and a bigger barrel could do a better job on integration.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
81,Yamazaki Sherry Cask,48.0,Japanese,112,"No doubts from the color what type of cask this is: first-fill, sherry. The nose shows masses of bitter chocolate, fresh coffee grounds, black cherry, and molasses cut with humid aromas of damp earth, nut, and dried fruit. This bittersweet theme continues on the tongue, but its sweetness surprises, with the spirit pushing the tannins away just enough to reveal itself. If you like savory power, this is for you. For me, while it’s instructive, it’s too grippy.  £70",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
81,Glenlivet Guardians Single Cask 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,238,"A limited edition—there are only 630 bottles of this—for those who are “Glenlivet Guardians.” A sherry refill, it’s a gentle expression that has typical Glenlivet floral elements that are more lifted than usual: elderflower cordial, jasmine, and night-scented stocks. A subtle spiciness emerges with a drop of water. This general smoothness continues on the palate with ginger in syrup and an enlivening citric note on the finish.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
81,Lagavulin Feis Ile 2012 bottling (Cask #1716) 1998 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,133,"At first I wondered what was going on here. This Lagavulin has more of the austerity typical of Port Ellen. There’s a tense minerality on the nose giving the impression of salty rock-pools and samphire. Water makes it sweeter and oyster-like. There’s big delivery on the tongue, with masses of distillery character, but that tension remains to the saline finish. In a head-to-head with Caol Ila, the former wins hands down. £85",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
81,Reservoir Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A hot wash of vanilla and sweet cloves and cinnamon, with shouty alcohol heat and a log of oak; whatever else this is, ‘subtle’ is not on the menu. Wow, is that hot in the mouth! Still, it’s flavorful with it; cinnamon candy and corn on the cob gush onto the palate. There are some cobby notes though, and a bit of mustiness. The finish is—surprise!—hot, and fades reluctantly. Doc Bryson prescribes more time in a large barrel.  ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
81,Seagram’s VO,40.0,Canadian,,"A nose like light caramel corn, with a hint of biscuit dryness and a smidgen of cinnamon sugar. Light in the mouth, sweet and a bit spicy, with some cinnamon heat toward the end. There is a bit of a roar right in the middle, where the grainy sweetness catches fire briefly, but mostly this is fairly meek stuff. Made for mixing, no real flaws.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
81,Great Lakes Distillery Kinnickinnic,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A blend of aged (sourced) bourbon and Great Lakes’ own (young) malt whiskey. Quite sweet on the nose; a rich, herbal sweetness with a strong, youthful quality to it. Interestingly medicinal on the tongue as the herbal character swells. A full mouthfeel, with clear references to new make about it: a bit oily, grassy, and bright. The finish is the best part: minty and a bit drying, a pleasant farewell. Interesting concept. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
81,Smooth Ambler Old Scout Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,,"Quite mild on the nose for 99 proof: dry oak, light honey, crisp corn. It all fires up in the mouth, a thick wash of hot oak and corn—attic whiskey—white pepper, and a tongue-crinkling woodiness leading to a drying finish that leaves you thirsty and swallowing as it fades. This may only be 6 years old (according to the label) but they were hot years. Better with a bit of water. (sourced whiskey) ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
81,New Zealand South Island 21 year old,40.0,New Zealand,,"The Doublewood experiment highlighted above may be the way forward for what's left of this old New Zealand stock, because having tasted several samples now, and presumably the better ones, there's a pattern emerging. The core whisky is fine, with tangy lemon and earthy pepper, but the casks clearly weren't great and they throw up inconsistencies. This is fine as far as it goes—until you see the price tag. This is $120 in American dollars. Nor is it as good as the Rugby World Cup 16 year old Vindication bottling.  NZ$148",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
81,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1962 (Cask #2639),,Single Malt Scotch,899,"More of a reddish hue, but as equally robust as the 1961 (see below). Some baked characters alongside dried cherry and barberry, which shift toward balsamic-like concentration. Hint of black pudding (blood sausage) and bitter chocolate. The palate is tight and tannic, with a hint of smoke and cooked dried fruits. Water loosens the tannic grip, allowing licorice to show. (U.S. exclusive.)",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
81,Royal Lochnagar 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Diageo’s smallest distillery and another that has worm tubs. The character here is grassy: think hay and straw rather than lawn clippings. There’s just a hint of cereal behind, and a fresh, roasted spiciness. The palate has good central sweetness where you just get a hint of fruit. Light and fresh, and a good afternoon dram. £33",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
81,St. George Diamond Jubilee,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"The Norfolk-based English Whisky Company joins in the celebrations. It’s bright gold with a lovely sweetness to the nose, fresh peach, a little anise, some lily of the valley, and almond. There’s plenty happening on this light-to-medium base. The palate is clean, with hazelnut and layers of flavor where succulent fruits play off the sweet spices. This is a distillery that, as the Aussies say, is hitting its straps. For me, it’s their best release yet. £60",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
81,"Reservoir Wheat Whiskey Year II, Batch 2",50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Wow, that's a small barrel whiskey! Only 2 years old, and more like 12 years dark, with a nose stuffed full of oak char, steamy mint, and hot vanilla. You know it's wheat in the mouth; despite the aggressive nose and the heat you do get, this is still pretty friendly stuff for 50%: sweet dough, mint, and more oak. But the finish roars in real hot and a bit astringent, ruining the moment, and water doesn't help.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
81,Prichard’s Sweet Lucy,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"A sweet mélange of bourbon, honey, ladyfingers, and praline in the nose, with a faint thread of heavy tree blossoms. Quite sweet, but not syrupy, and the aromas — minus the blossoms — are here, plus vanilla. Some stickiness on the finish, but it’s not unpleasant, more like candy, which is what this experience is like: booze candy. That candy simplicity is confusing: there are a lot of flavors here, but at a candy level. A bit less sweetness would be welcome.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
81,Caol Ila Unpeated 12 year old Special Release 2011,64.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"An established regular member of Diageo’s annual set of Special Releases, this expression celebrates the lesser-known side of Islay’s largest distillery; its production of a non-smoked expression. It was this unpeated style that saved Caol Ila during the great decimation of distilleries in the early 1980s. This example is intense and needs LOTS of water for its fragrance of cut grass, sherbet, and coconut water to emerge. The palate shows boiled sweets and has a pleasingly clinging quality. £53 ",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
81,Kilchoman 2006 vintage 5 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"It often takes time for a new distillery to find its feet, but Kilchoman’s spirit was top quality from the first day. Its limited-edition releases act as markers on a work in progress, but are precociously advanced for their tender years. This, the first 5 year old, leads with a note like wet rushes/wet dog (that’s good!) alongside lightly turfy smoke. The palate is sweet, smoked, and thick with allspice on the finish. A star is born.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
81,Abhainn Dearg Single Malt Special Edition,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The first spirit distilled at Abhainn Dearg is now 3 years old and legally Scotch single malt whisky. The distillery has celebrated with a single cask, non-colored, non-chill filtered release of 2,011 500 ml bottles. Apricots, crystallized ginger, candied peel, and papier-mâché on the nose. The palate features fresh fruit, spicy oak, honeycomb, and finally, toffee. Quite short in the finish, with more toffee, and a nutty note. £150",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
81,Concannon,40.0,Irish,,"An Irish blend matured in used bourbon barrels and finished in Concannon Petite Sirah wine barrels. Very clean and fresh, with mouth-coating honeyed malt, vanilla, tropical fruit, and golden raisin. Fleeting, light oak finish. My only issue with this whiskey is that it tastes young. I would like to see another four to five years of aging (in bourbon casks, not Sirah) for this whiskey to really develop. (Available only in the U.S.)",John Hansell,Spring 2012
81,Chichibu The First distilled 2008 (bottled 2011),,Japanese,,"Ichiro Akuto, whose family previously owned the now demolished Hanyu distillery, and have five centuries of experience in sake production, opened his boutique distillery outside the town of Chichibu just over three years ago. This is the first official release of whisky (rather than new make) and it’s delicious. Lightly scented with touches of lemongrass, fennel pollen, sweet pear, and cookie dough, it has lovely balance and weight. Water allows it to spread over the tongue. One to watch. £90",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
81,Jura Elixir,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,25,"Jura Elixir is exclusive to the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain, and takes its name from the legend that the water of Jura possesses life-prolonging qualities. Elixir was finished in a mix of American white oak and ex-sherry casks.  The nose is mildly fungal, with caramel and sea salt. Treacle toffee, ginger, and citrus fruits on the palate, which is ultimately slightly acrid. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with licorice. £16 (350 ml)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
81,Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Cragganmore) 1997 14 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Light straw. Initially this is quite hot and a little dumb, with whiffs of Indian spice — think turmeric and curry leaf — along with mint sauce (but no lamb) and a tickle of peat. The palate is quite intense and hot, with powdered almond, a grassy edge, and concentrated sweetness that starts in the center and builds toward the back palate. Subtle, but can’t help wishing there was just a little more say from the cask. £59",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
81,Woodstone Creek Whiskey Barrel Bierschnaaps,47.0,Single Malt American Whiskey,,"Woodstone’s using a local brewer’s beer as the basis for this one. Intriguing nose: grainy, sweet, but also a bit green/herbaceous. That's quite tasty! The malt comes through broad and sweet, the herbal character floats over the top and perks up the taste buds, almost like a digestif. The finish is tinged with honey and herbs, but dries up nicely. Smooth for the proof, too.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
81,Armorik Double Maturation,42.0,French Whisky,,"Armorik has been making whisky for more than twelve years; it's growing in confidence, and the quality is improving. There's peat in the malt here, and it gives the whisky a feisty and earthy quality. The spirit is matured first in Armorik oak barrels and then transferred to sherry. Sherry and peat is a tough trick to pull off and this just about gets away with it, with coastal brine and lemon rubbing up against wood smoke, barley, and honey. €38 ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
81,Santis Edition Dreifaltigkeit,52.0,Swiss,,"If you're looking for a radically different tasting malt whisky to anything else you know, start here. This is all Christmas church incense, burnt treacle toffee, charcoal, and overdone barbecued meat. Weird? Multiply by five and you're getting there. But I took this to a two-day music festival for 25-35 year olds, and of the 20 world whiskies on show, this was one of the most requested. €62",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
81,Mackmyra Moments &mdash; Jord,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"This is the Mackmyra equivalent of an arena rock band playing a small town club gig; a raw, rough and ready, in your face rock and roll version of the whisky — and it’s not for the faint-hearted. Matured in French red wine casks, it has a pleasant apricot and woodsmoke nose, while the taste is young, brittle, and gristy, with intense and persistent pepper, ginger, and bitter berries. Well-made, but not the best starting point to explore Mackmyra. ",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
81,Glen Moray 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A malt that was overlooked by one owner (Glenmorangie) and is now, under the auspices of a new one (La Martiniquaise), beginning to ease itself back into the single malt world. Its problem has been the price: too low (see Speyburn). The standard 12 year old bottling gives a perfect idea of its potential. This is as soft and sweet a malt as you could ask for: peaches, toffee, and baked apple, with a tobacco/cedar/pine note from the oak. ",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
81,St. George Royal Marriage,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"Released to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Kate, it’s a combination of casks, with the standard unpeated and peated English whiskies mixed with malt matured in a mix of casks. The nose is nothing special, but the whisky is something else again. It’s initially bold, spicy, and assertive, but swim over the first waves and there’s a calmer, fruitier heart here. Another big step forward for an increasingly confident distillery. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
81,Dry Fly Washington Wheat Whiskey,40.0,Wheat Whiskey,,"Sweet, crisp nose: apple, mint, wintergreen. Grainy in the mouth; sweet, bready flavors. The whiskey coats the mouth, but more in an obscuring way; it seems to get between you and the flavors. It is quite smooth compared to young bourbons, but it leaves me looking for more. Overall impression is of a sweeter, younger whiskey that needs to mature, and the clean character makes me think maturity would look good on it. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
82,Ko‘olau Old Pali Road Whiskey (Batch 001),43.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),45,"The nose is floral and grain-forward, with green banana, lemon pith, Honey Nut Cheerios, and wood spice. On the palate, sweet whipped cream and lemon are overlaid by white pepper and Popsicle stick. It finishes hot and dry. A blend of whiskey made from a bourbon mash by Ko‘olau Distillery and 5 year old whiskey from Missouri.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
82,Bondi Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Yes, this is named for the beach in Australia, and its light character might well be intended for seaside sipping. Orange blossom, lemon, and cinnamon gum vie with Popsicle stick on the nose. The light-bodied palate has more orange, cinnamon candy, nuttiness, and a lot of oak that becomes cloying on the finish. Overall, it has the effect of making one wish there were just a bit more body and character.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
82,Trader Joe’s Rum Cask Finish Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,20,"Somewhat vegetal on the nose, with stewed fruit, licorice, tarragon, ginger, butterscotch, and hazelnuts. More stewed fruit, salted licorice, and hazelnuts appear on the palate, along with white pepper, clove, and bitter oak. An abrupt whisky whose better characteristics are muddied by the first-fill rum cask finish. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
82,Noble Oak Bourbon (prototype),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"The caramel on the nose is a bit strange and chemical, but the palate offers promise with its pleasing spice, sweetness, orange peel, chocolate, and silky mouthfeel. There are lovely flavors, but the oak feels layered on rather than integrated.

Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 12 months;

82,O.Z. Tyler Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"Wood spice dominates the nose, with citrus, floral, and tobacco barn aromas. The palate has pleasant orange peel, spice, red apple, and vanilla notes with a robust heat; however, toasted oak continues to reign. One for the wood lover.

82,Taconic Straight Bourbon Dutchess Private Reserve,45.0,Craft Whiskey,38,"Sweet and simple candied nose. Palate is thin, bright, and lemony, like a fluffy mouthful of sweet marshmallows, with hints of banana, circus peanuts candy, and gingery spice. Not especially complex, but pleasant enough.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
82,Cooper’s Legacy Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Very oaky, with a nose of fresh sawdust, but beneath lurk deep maple sweetness, pralines, and cherry cough drop. The palate is chewy, sweet, and nutty, with pleasing caramel and butterscotch, but is hurt by some peculiar varnish and furniture polish notes. Finishes with cherry, leather, and more oak.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
82,Patriot’s Trail Bourbon,42.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"The rye spice on the nose is big, broad, and aromatic, with allspice and clove in the mix, but there are some distillation issues, with a slight rubber-tire note of feints. Rich and viscous on the palate, it’s slightly hot, but shows really lovely spice and toasted nuts, turning oak-dominated on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
82,A.D. Laws Secale Mash 2nd Fill Oak Rye (Batch BBL #4X),50.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"The oak is nicely subdued and integrated here, allowing buttered fruits to show through—baked spiced apple and poached pear—laced with spearmint and bay leaf. The creamy palate is nicely balanced with baking spices of cinnamon and clove and hints of pepper, giving way to a pleasantly drying, chalky finish. Price is per 375 ml.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
82,Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch No. 1 Red Rye Finish,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,22,"America, Walker wants your cocktails. Emma Walker that is, the blender whose signature adorns the first of these experimental expressions. Toffee Speyside nose, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, cool mint, and a pronounced grain note from Port Dundas. Orange, lime peel, lovely caramel richness, and creamy toffee through dilution. The brand’s second consecutive rye cask finish: you noticed too? Up against its sibling, JW Select Rye Cask, there are certain similarities, but this is fruitier, less intricate, and less rich and spicy.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
82,White Oak Akashi Meïsei Blended Whisky,40.0,Japanese,44,"Spicy and savory with dark soy sauce, the blackened bark of a hunk of roasted meat, peppercorn, fennel, and faint lemon zest. Lemon meringue pie and tangerine flavors; quite sweet, with lovely flowing spices throughout, and a few green notes, but when the creamy fudge comes in, the ride is over. Compared with the standard blend, this has greater balance, benefiting from the absence of the more abrasive spices and herbal aromas. Abrupt finish, leaving a hollow spiciness behind. £35",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
82,That Boutique-y Whisky Company English Whisky 5 year old (batch 1),,Single Malt English Whisky,50,"This hothead stomps around the place, lashing out the peaty punches, but this raw power comes at the expense of balance. Coal scuttles, crumbly compost, smoked grass, chocolate ganache, and aromas of pit-cooked, blackened joints of pork. A thin medley of lemon, grapefruit, and orange segments is smothered by dense plumes of smoke, even more peaty with a dash of water, and it billows its way to a finish of chalky, fizzy candy round a bonfire. Imagine a smoked Trebor refresher. (964 bottles) £40",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
82,"Booker’s 2016-03 “Toogie’s Invitation,” 64.5%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"At 6 years, 4 months, and 4 days old, there’s a bit of an old-school bourbon nose, with caramel and butterscotch leading. Chocolate, cinnamon, and nutmeg follow. What starts out promising turns to grain, opening up to cornbread, freshly baked rye bread, and vanilla cupcake batter. Once the chewy-to-dry mouthfeel is established, there’s walnut bread, rice pudding, and buttered toast over heat. With water, the grain disappears and malty caramel dominates. This needs water or ice to maximize potential.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
82,West Cork Barrel Proof,62.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,55,"I loosen up my shoulders and crick my neck, first left, then right: this is strong whisky. Creamed coconut, a little fudge, hints of nutmeg, unpeeled bananas, and quite a young grain character on the nose. Powerful: West Cork firing on all six. Sweet charred wood, caramel, macadamia nuts, and cinnamon toffee emerge unscathed. Settles down obediently with water: cinnamon toast and tasty caramels. This can handle plenty of water, though ultimately, the flavors still arrive at the same destination. (4,800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
82,The Silkie,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,50,"Folklore tells of the Silkies, whose siren voices and beckoning, limpid eyes were irresistible to any man. From the team planning to build Sliabh Liag Distillery in County Donegal comes a palate of vanilla fudge, wood spices, and some vegetal notes following a nose of cold toffee brittle, fresh-cut herbs, and white pepper. A conspicuous grain character penetrates through, but this adds to a mature profile, making this blend stand out from the crowd of bourbon cask sweeties. €47",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
82,The Balvenie Madeira Cask 21 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,212,"Another Travel Retail exclusive, but what is a highly lucrative retail sector will inevitably demand items that shoppers can’t buy elsewhere. Imagine Balvenie Port Wood 21 year old, but with more sweetness; damson jam, blueberries, and a slight singed note before maple syrup calls in from the back. It’s big and rounded and, for me, just lacking the definition and complexity of the Port Wood. For sweeter tooths (teeth?) perhaps.",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
82,Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2009,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Using this ancient barley variety is a challenge for a distiller. The yields are low, the mash thick and hard to work, but I’m delighted that Bruichladdich has persevered. It adds a more overt cereal note to the whisky, taking the Laddie off into a different world of honey-nut corn flakes. There’s also a surprising rose-like perfume. It’s young, so add water to cut its more, er, bracing qualities. In fact, have it with ice and soda. <em>(Travel Retail exclusive) £58</em>",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
82,Deanston 20 year old Oloroso,,Single Malt Scotch,180,"This cask strength bottling has been matured in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. The nose offers old leather and a slightly vegetal note, along with ginger and developing toffee. The palate features unexpectedly dry sherry, rapidly giving treacle, plain chocolate, and dark spices. Hot spices, with black pepper and raisins in the lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
82,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,44.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"A relatively heavily-peated variant of Glenglassaugh matured in 50-liter octave casks, giving significant cask influence due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. This expression is non-chill filtered. Carbolic soap and a mineral note on the softly smoky nose, followed by apple pie and cream notes. The palate is medium-sweet and quite spicy, with black pepper. Now clear, dry peat notes present themselves with a touch of chili. Ashy peat and cinnamon in the medium-length finish. £55",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
82,Knob Creek 2001 (Batch 1),50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"Highly anticipated, this release offers freshly-popped kettle corn, cinnamon, nutmeg, oak, hints of fruit and floral. Then it feels unbalanced, a bitter woodiness hiding hopeful flavors. Once the wood disappears there’s caramel, vanilla, and baking spice over heat. A drop of water corrects the dominant oak and gives this a sipper’s chance.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
82,The Exclusive Malts  (distilled at Caledonian)  28 year old 1987,,Single Malt Scotch,191,"Overripe cantaloupe, green apple, banana custard, and whole almond are the main soloists, though they are accompanied by a linear grain overture running through it. A quartet of golden sultana, mint, ginger, and pepper play the opening movement, then sit back as toffee-dipped banana flavors orchestrate a delicious climax before a diminuendo into minor chords, with sour gooseberry and herbal notes to finish. Water works well, elevating bright notes of lemon sponge on the palate. (238 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
82,Sons of Liberty Battle Cry Oloroso Sherry Finish (Batch 2),46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Deep golden in color with a pinkish cast, this shows good purity of fruit, with red berry, black cherry, toasty oak, and some oxidative nutty notes layered across a creamy, malty palate. A nice grilled-fruit palate echoes with sweetness and charcoal smoke on the long finish. The sherry contributes a lot of nice character, but without more overall maturity feels a bit like window dressing.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
82,Painted Stave Diamond State Bourbon (Batch 2),47.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"A coppery, auburn color betrays small barrels, in this case just ten gallons. The distinctive aroma of sassafras recalls rolling in a pile of autumn leaves, then quickly gives way to the apparent spice of a high-rye mashbill. The earthy and spicy qualities meld nicely, developing cedar box and sandalwood, wrapped in the sweetness of maple syrup, while the palate feels slick and buttery before a finish lingering with cinnamon and warm oatmeal cookie.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
82,Cascadia Rye (Bottle No. 97),,Rye Whiskey,52,"Chocolate, honey, vanilla, cotton candy, smoke from barbecue coals, and a big whiff of brown sugar cooking in butter. Then oak shows, softening to vanilla and an explosion of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. You’re thinking this is a nice mid-range rye, but a short finish really disappoints. Its finish is saved by a nice hint of dill. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
82,Coopers’ Craft Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,29,"You can actually smell the cooper toasting oak here, so the name carries real meaning. Then cotton candy, fresh-baked rye, vanilla, apple, and caramel come to life. A slight hint of grain becomes more expressive on the tongue, offering bread-like flavors with hints of brown sugar and honey. Short finish with a hint of grain. If you like light-bodied bourbons, this is right up your alley.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
82,Union Horse Distilling Reunion Straight Rye (Batch 2),,Craft Whiskey,40,"Made with 100% rye aged up to 5 years, this starts off surprisingly fruit-forward, with poached pear and zesty, clove-pierced citrus, though the wood is beginning to dominate. The palate fires up the rye spice, underscored by cocoa, turning hot with some adhesive notes and finishing with fresh cereal grain and bitter oak tannins. A wood lover’s whiskey.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
82,Vapor Boulder Bourbon,42.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Pretty fruit gets swept up in distinct anise and fennel-bulb aromas, with hints of mint and quinine, backed by vanilla. Very soft, creamy, and rounded on the palate, the peachy stone fruit comes nicely balanced with oak, sweet vanilla, and glimmers of nutmeg and clove spices before the cocoa powder finish. Well-constructed, smooth, and easy-drinking with a pleasant persistence of fruit.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
82,Moon Harbour PIER 1,,Blended French Whisky,59,"Named for the Port de la Lune, of course, the crescent arc of the Garonne flowing through Bordeaux. The company expects to start single malt production in 2017 in their new distillery, but meanwhile enjoy this Sauternes cask finish with its white grape, light honey, floral, and peach aromas.  Flavor delivery is all up front; peach syrup and soft toffees, with some burnt spices on the finish. A character of its own, certainly not an imitator.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
82,Whisky Castle Oloroso (Cask 494),48.0,Swiss,92,"Another creation from Elfingen, Switzerland, this rich, dark, chestnut-color dram combines their Smoke Barley with <em>oloroso</em> cask maturation. The nose is a merry mix of sweet peat smoke cushioned by Serrano ham, dried fig, and fish box reek. Berry fruits and sultana initially, though the texture is quite tannic with the stronger alcohol showing through. It develops a bubblegum note, with over-boiled fruit and some savory meat juices rounding off a short, dry finish. CHF89",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
82,Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,15,"Somewhat forgotten, this table bourbon is ripe with fired-corn salsa, citrus zest, and a hint of butterscotch. It could use another year or two in the barrel, but the grains, caramel, and fruit (with a hint of spice) are delicious on their own. Want a house bourbon for cocktails? This is a fine pick.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
82,Dunkel,45.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Label says “Dunkel,” release says “Dunkelweizen,” two very different beers. Mostly strong sawn oak on the nose, with some clove (so maybe Dunkelweizen is closer). Springy, spicy, and a bit oily on the tongue; German gingerbread on the finish. (375 ml.)",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
82,W.L. Weller Special Reserve,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,18,"Once a 7 year old product, W.L. Weller Special Reserve no longer carries an age statement, but the wheated bourbon still brings caramel-forward joy and hints of watermelon and fresh-baked bread. Enjoy the short bursts of crème brulee, praline, honey, Jolly Rancher watermelon candy, and a hint of nutmeg, because it’s not there long. You can see the potential.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
82,Inchmurrin 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,52,"Matured in a mixture of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe peaches, malt, and vanilla on the nose, with a hint of linseed oil. Oily on the palate, with more peaches, plus quite dark spices, backed by creamy vanilla. Medium in length, spicy, with emerging dry oak notes. £36",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
82,Popcorn Sutton Small Batch Recipe,44.0,Craft Whiskey,29,"Made by ex-Dickel distiller John Lunn at the brand&#039;s new distillery, a new bottling, new name. “Distilled from grain and sugar.” Smells like clean white dog: warm, ripe melon, alcohol heat, grain. Smoothly drinkable, not hot or astringent. Simple, sweet: melon, cooked grain. Sweeter than vodka, and a bit more flavorful, but otherwise pretty similar. I still don&#039;t get the attraction.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
82,Port Dundas 12 year old,40.0,Single Grain Whisky,50,"It’s been four years since Diageo last released an official single grain whisky from this Glasgow distillery. This will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks, light vanilla sponge fingers, and waxy linseeds. The American oak notes are all over this: vanilla, sweet granola, and pecan, yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too. The creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain whisky.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
82,Old Grand-Dad Bonded,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"The new packaging of Old Grand-Dad doesn’t say bottled in bond, but only “bonded.” At first look, the impression is not good. The straw color makes me think it’s young. Then grains burst out of the glass with a hint of mint. Is this repackaged young whiskey? Then, to my surprise, an explosion. Baking spices, freshly baked bread, and cinnamon roll bring this whiskey home. I’d love to taste it after a few more years in the barrel, but it’s mighty tasty as it is now.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
82,Old Particular (distilled at Cambus) 27 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,126,"Oh boy! It’s like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin, the steam bringing the moist, sweet goodness to your nostrils. Roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party. On the palate, the alcohol strength is noticeably strong, with flavors of red currant, cranberry, and black pepper. At the fruitier end of the Cambus spectrum, this concludes with a whimper of spices, leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail. (270 bottles) £87",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
82,Amador Double Barrel Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Sourced bourbon at 3 to 10 years old was dumped and finished in Napa Valley wine barrels. The nose is mostly bourbon—corn, warm meadow, hard candy—with a floater of wine wood; I&#039;m guessing white wine. The flavor is quite woody, but not old wood; fresher, and a bit astringent, overshadowing the whiskey. Not sure the finish does it a favor. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
82,Bowman’s Canadian,40.0,Canadian,15,"The freshly opened bottle smells promising, with spirit, toffee, suggestions of cloves, a blast of steely rye, and grapefruit juice on the nose. On the palate it is sweet, somewhat hot, slightly perfumed, and overall, quite simple. A lovely glow in the back of the mouth and on the tongue doesn’t last, but is replaced by hints of caramel and citrus fruit. Good, solid session whisky.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
82,Southern Crown Club,40.0,Canadian,21,"The nose shows great promise, with real maple syrup, gummy bears, hints of peppermint and cinnamon, and clean lumber. Tangerine juice, dark fruits, white pepper, and ginger seem somehow less than the nose predicted. It feels good, with its creamy smooth palate and glowing gingery heat. Finishes with mild grapefruit pith and searing pepper that goes on forever.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
82,Cadenhead’s (distilled at BenRiach) 1996,,Single Malt Scotch,145,"Once again, some assertive distillery character to the fore which, in BenRiach’s case, means plenty of ripe sweet fruits, cooked apples, a jag of citrus, and a background malty note. There’s a pleasant, slightly oxidative, wine-like note with water. The sweetness dominates the palate, with the nuttiness moving to hot breakfast cereal and, in typical BenRiach fashion, a sweet spiced finish. Lovely, but not overly different from official bottlings.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
82,Usquaebach Reserve,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"This blend is generously half malt and half grain, unusually selecting 16-18 year old malts. The result has a nose of rich honey and florals, resplendent in a citrus intensity: squeezed orange skin with a background note of dry crackers. The palate is orange and malty, with cola, faint spices, and a little waxiness, but the core feels a little hollow. A good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in. A decent stand-up dram.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
82,Old Hickory Great American Bourbon,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"MGP bourbon aged to 4 years. Sweet and brittle nose, hot and a bit spicy, but thin. More spice and body on the tongue than the Old Hickory Blended, and a more balanced finish, but still a relatively light whiskey. Beautiful bottle, classic label; I wish there was more whiskey here. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
82,Pendleton,40.0,Canadian,38,"A U.S.-only Canadian blend, bottled in Oregon. Rich toffee and caramel aroma with cashews and some dry cocoa. An easy entry, with sweet, light, but coating caramel, a keening note of young blending whisky, some cedar shavings, and a sweet finish that manages not to cling. Simple and sweet, practically pining for a bubbly mixer, but not bad for dessert, either. Quite typical of the category.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
82,Jameson,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,23,"Meet the undisputed driver of the Irish whiskey resurgence. The nose is light, with baked apple strudel, toasty staves, and hints of the bourbon and sherry cask influence. There are discernible pot still elements contributing a fruity character and plenty of weight. This dominant triple distilled whiskey is smooth, sure, although that characteristic improves noticeably up the range. Expect Braeburn apples, raspberry, strawberry, currants, and mixed peel, with a short finish of cinnamon spice and a dull fruit note.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
82,Glenturret Peated Edition,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"This expression comprises peated Glenturret malt (55ppm) and some older unpeated Glenturret malt. The distillery has been making peated malt for six years. There is a higher proportion of peated malt in this revised edition than in the previous version. Farmyard aromas on the nose, with an overlay of digestive biscuits and subtle smokiness. Light-bodied, with watery toffee and emerging peat smoke. Medium-length in the finish, spicy, with cigarette smoke. £47",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
82,Glenturret Triple Wood,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"Matured in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry butts, refill American oak hogsheads, and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose is initially savory, with salted caramels, oak, vanilla, and toffee. Medium-bodied, with brittle toffee and spicy fruit on the creamy palate, where more savory notes emerge. A hint of bourbon in the softly spiced, herbal finish, which darkens to black coffee. £47",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
82,The Macallan 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"It’s young Macallan. There’s a hint of sulfur (from distillate rather than cask), then wet leather, Brazil nut, muesli, dried pineapple, and raisin; even a little rubber, suggestive of youth. That can’t hide the fact that this is a big, deep, oily dram. Water makes it considerably more coherent, showing a substantial, thick palate with some licorice. Ripe, but you can’t help feeling that 12 is a little young for this slow-maturing distillate.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
82,Gouden Carolus,46.0,Belgian Whisky,40,"Rowntree’s fruit gums, chalky Edinburgh rock, root ginger, and oat biscuits on the nose. It’s a double distillation of the mash for Gouden Carolus Tripel beer, aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, then finished for 6 months in custom-coopered Het Anker barrels. Those fruit gums are inescapable on the palate, but there is malt, warm toffee, apple, peach, and a tingle of orange. Gingersnaps, vanilla pod, and building tanginess spill over in the finish, which ebbs into a peppery haze. €37",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
82,Douglas Laing Single Minded Speyside 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,88,"A broad and humid aroma, like walking through hot bracken in the summer. Quite substantial, with lemon, pecan, and, in time, chestnut. It’s this last aroma that carries through most strongly onto the tongue. There’s light grip, and even at 46% some level of heat. Water reveals oak and pencil shavings/cedar, while the grip has now loosened. Out comes a more crisp attack and hints of delicate top notes. The finish is pretty dry. £56",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
82,Blood Oath Pact No. 1,,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A blend of three bourbons, between 6 and 12 years old; two rye and one wheat. Nothing is revealed on the source, which is a fair part of the “blood oath,” apparently. A restrained nose of corncakes, biscuits, a bit of cinnamon and maple: breakfasty. Flavors of corn, spicy oak, and some grassy mint fight to be heard over roaring heat that flames on into the finish. Frankly too simple for the asking price. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
82,Smögen Bourbon Single Cask,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,110,"Again, this uses malt peated to 45 ppm, which is evident by the nose of salty beach bonfires, though there is an intense, honeyed sweetness to enjoy: golden syrup bars, toasted English muffins, <em>stroopwafel</em>, and a cool line of spearmint. Although the alcohol roars loudly, there is honey and banana, some Tabasco heat, and flashes of orange. Water adds creaminess to the nose, but the structure doesn’t respond so well. Tough it out at full strength. (<em>295 bottles</em>) SEK 953",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
82,Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,44,"This new NAS might surprise those who recall the Chivas Bros. “Age Matters” campaign, but that’s whisky for you. The initial impression is of a fresh maltiness, sweet hay, and fresh porridge oats, then comes sawn oak, but it opens into pineapple, becoming more obviously Glenlivet. The palate is pretty and light, but seems a bit hollow in the middle, making the whole package slightly insubstantial. Water enhances and sweetens the nose, but deepens that mid-palate hole. £30",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
82,Kilbeggan 21 year old,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,132,"A limited edition blend of malt and grain whiskeys from some of the company’s oldest Irish stocks aged in a combination of bourbon, port, sherry, and Madeira woods. The nose of vanilla slice, marzipan, baklava, iced buns, and hay bales suggests that none of the cask types take overall charge. It’s mild and mellow, with rolling spices, honey, melon, baked lemon, and red berry fruits. Tranquil, easygoing: a moment of Zen. €125",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
82,Jim Beam Signature Craft Whole Rolled Oat,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Nose of corn and subdued Beam spiciness. It’s hot, and sweet, and minty-spicy, but the main difference from mainline Beam is the feel. This is slicker, lighter, slippery, and the finish has a softness to it, almost plushy. The oak seems lost (for an 11 year old), and that lets the sweetness dominate. It’s like a toy breed; it yips, when it should bark and growl. I think oats are too soft for bourbon. Price per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
82,Potter’s Special Old,40.0,Canadian,24,"Highwood Distillers has returned from their devastating 2013 flood with better whisky than ever. A soft, sweet, fruity nose understates the power of an intensely spicy palate chock-full of sour, bitter kumquats. Subtle honey flavors abound, with delicate threads of golden burley tobacco entwined. It’s a simple dram for mixing, but with plenty of interest to satisfy those who would rather sip. Add ginger ale and ice, or drink straight up. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$30",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
82,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Macallan) 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,101,"Full gold. A solid middle-weight Macallan with some putty/Play-Doh, and even after this length of time, a certain youthful airiness. This slightly lean aspect gives way to an almost suety richness. When neat, the palate is a little jumbled: caramelized cask-derived notes, cereal, oiled jackets. Water improves things, releasing an aroma akin to Chenin Blanc, then cooked pear and a big hit of sugared almonds on the back palate. £69",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
82,Two James Grass Widow,,Craft Whiskey,69,"MGP-sourced bourbon is finished in Madeira <em>barriques</em>, and shows a nicely reddish color. Nose is corn and wine gums; not hot, not sweet. Flash-hot in the mouth, light body and some candy and minerality with the corn; a prickly heat and acidity at the end, but overall, more pleasant than that sounds.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
82,The Dalmore Valour,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Initial maturation of Valour takes place in first-fill bourbon casks, before a period in 30 year old Matusalem <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts from Gonzales Byass. Finally it is transferred to port pipes from the Duoro region of Portugal. The nose is floral, with sherry notes, ripe oranges, and marzipan, while the palate offers dark sherry, with bitter orange, contrasting chocolate-coated fudge, and gingersnaps. The finish is medium to long, with lively spices and berry bitterness. <em>(Travel Retail only) </em>Price is per liter.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
82,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenallachie) 22 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Light gold. A little shy initially, but Glenallachie isn’t noted for its effusiveness. It has a clean and slightly nutty aroma, with light honey alongside grilled hazelnut. The palate is fairly crisp and slightly bunched up to start, until this nutty sweetness expands in the center. Ever so slightly oily. Water flattens the aromatics a bit, but allows the flavors to spread gently. All in all, a decent example of an uncommonly seen single malt. £85",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
82,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Fettercairn) 2003,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,56,"An 11 year old Fettercairn from Douglas Laing, this is an undemanding but pleasing Highland dram. It comes from a distillery which tends to polarize opinion among drinkers. The nose is light and crisp, slightly floral, with pear juice and a hint of honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and drinking chocolate. Powdery in the finish, with tangerines and a suggestion of Parma violets. £37",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
82,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,206,"Gold. Quite sweet and spicy nose. Light cinnamon and that distillery ginger edge. There remains a light cereal aspect to the background, but it is considerably more youthful than the age suggests. The palate is equally sweet and direct, with excellent spicy concentration. Water shows that there is some weight here, reminiscent of honey-nut cornflakes (with cream). The nose now hints at some oxidation, the palate retains peppery freshness. It’s another I’d have kept in cask. £135",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
82,Wigle Whim Mocha Porter,46.0,Craft Whiskey,34,"I reviewed a couple of these one-off Wigle Whims earlier. This one’s quite roasty indeed, almost coffee-like, made with roasted barley and wheat, and caramel and chocolate malts. It smells of burnt grain with sweet toffee underneath. Lots of chocolate and cocoa struggle with ash and burnt grain, leading to a hot finish where they end up, finally, in agreement, a smoky mocha mouthful, espresso whiskey. Invigorating. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
82,Label 5 Classic Black,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,17,"This is the foundation stone of the whole Label 5 range and it’s a solid, reputable blend that works neat, with a rock of ice, or in cocktails. The digestive biscuits, dark walnut toffee, and fruit salad aromas concede to a rather inauspicious palate of burnt orange, malt biscuits, charred oak, and ground ginger. It’s lively through to its malt and spice conclusion.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
82,Onyx Moonshine Reserve Secret Stash,,Craft Whiskey,35,"Onyx (East Hartford, Conn.) ages their &#039;moonshine&#039; in new charred oak barrels to make this expression.  Nose is fresh-sawn oak and sugar cookies, with a bit of cinnamon spice. Tons of fresh oak in the mouth (I&#039;d guess this is small-barrel whiskey) with a spicy sweetness, a hallmark of young craft whiskey, as is the quick finish. Still, no real flaws, and pleasant enough.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
82,The English Whisky Co. Chapter 14 Limited Edition,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,69,"Unripe pears, honeycomb, strawberry <em>millefeuille</em>, and vanilla custard. A light and pleasant expression, but it’s not the kind of complex dram that will hold your attention all night. This batch of unpeated 5 year old single malt from St. George was disgorged from just four American standard barrels, and the taste consists of waxy lemons, vanilla cream, and banana splits, with a growing caramel presence. A dry finish of light spices and sweet lemon. £45",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
82,Thomas H. Handy Rye,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Distilled in 2008, this is the youngest whiskey in the group. A vast departure from last year’s release — which was delicious — particularly on the palate. This year’s is thinner and less complex, with unintegrated spice, botanical, and vegetal notes dominating. Yes, there’s some honey, vanilla, bright fruit, and a hint of toffee, but it doesn’t help. Easily the weakest whiskey in this year’s Antique Collection, and a bit of a disappointment.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
82,Mackmyra Midnattssol,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,81,"Initial maturation in sherry and bourbon wood from the U.S. and Sweden, finished in fermented birch sap wine casks. Concentrated heather honey, wax, fresh mascarpone, fruit tarts, and toasted oak. It draws the mouth in: fruity, but not sweet. Stewed, dark fruits from the hedgerow and orchard (cherry, apple, plum, mulberry, and rhubarb), then a delayed splurge of spices and pepper, ending with Brazil nut, espresso, and bitter cacao. It’s all rather austere, serious, and forbidding. €65",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
82,Stillhouse Coconut Moonshine,20.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,28,"Of all the flavors you’d expect to see in the moonshine space, coconut is probably the last. Stillhouse’s Coconut Moonshine has a coconut cream nose with a touch of milk chocolate that’s actually inviting. On the palate it’s creamy, chocolatey coconut with just a hint of corn whiskey. The mid-palate lacks some structure, with only a touch of spice. The finish is also a little muted, but damn if they didn’t make a coconut moonshine that isn’t horrid.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
82,Master of Malt 10 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,64,"Batch 1 of this new blend brings oxidized apple, maple syrup, crispy potato skins, soft spices, and nutmeg grated over eggnog. Rich strands of citrus, mint, and raisins mingle, building in intensity to greater spiciness at the swallow, where ginger and burnt sugar emerges. Undiluted, there is a hot, spicy, slightly acrid finish dominated by the ginger. Water adds melon, mandarin, and apple and manages to keep the ginger in check. £40",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
82,Douglas Laing Provenance 8 year old (distilled at Ben Nevis),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,67,"This single cask (#10328) bottling was distilled in the summer of 2006 and matured in a refill hogshead. The nose is initially slightly mashy, with savory notes, becoming more floral, with caramel. Bold and spicy on the palate, with roasted meat and underlying citrus fruit and herbal notes. Mildly metallic dark chocolate in the medium-length finish.  £42",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
82,The Exclusive Malts Blend of Malts 20 year old 1994,50.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,100,"Whiskies from undisclosed Speyside and Highland distilleries are blended together in first-fill sherry butts. On the nose it’s an alluring blend of orange, cherry, toffee, salt, and ginger. The entry follows the nose with toffee, orange, ginger, and malt. Things begin to drop off in the mid-palate, which is very focused on salt and ginger, with strong alcohol undertones. The alcohol drives and defines a dry finish that&#039;s absent of much of what&#039;s so alluring about this whisky. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
82,Adelphi (distilled at Glenrothes) 7 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,135,"Massive with a huge sherried attack; seven years is the right time to bottle. There’s light raisin, date, and fig roll/treacle toffee, but it’s a funny one as it develops; while it is superficially impressive, it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts, aren’t talking to each other. Water brings out light cask-driven sulfur. On the palate, the black fruits and Demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol. It’s tannic already, though. Lacks integration, but what else to do?",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
82,The Fat Trout,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"Delicate nose of sherbet and melting heather honey layered over pleasant grassy and herbal notes. The texture is sweet, thin, and syrupy, with a slight vegetal note, before salted caramel reels it in, brimming over into a briny finish like a salty kiss. The grain clearly plays a major role. Truth be told, the aromas and flavors work well, but the lack of weight makes it feel like a tiddler rather than catch of the day. (<em>Selected U.S. states, NZ, Switzerland</em>).",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
82,Hillrock Solera Aged Bourbon Barrel 12,,Craft Whiskey,80,"Corn and oak on the nose, with a slice of fruit from sherry cask aging. Nose is strikingly different from the other two Hillrocks reviewed; sweeter, and softer. It’s clearly bourbon at the front, but as the flavors move back in the mouth and into the finish, the sherry takes over and dominates, becoming quite fruity at the close, though with a firm grip of charred oak. The sherry’s too much for a bourbon, especially at this price. Partially sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
82,Wigle Triple Double,46.0,Craft Whiskey,34,"Part of this Pittsburgh distillery’s series of “Whims” one-offs. Truly interesting nose: a combination of new-barrel bourbon reek and Irish raw barley grassiness, yielding mint, vanilla, juicy wet grain, and faint cinnamon. Hot entry of vanilla and small-barrel oak, which suddenly collapses to a dry cocoa sweetness spiked with hot pepper, like Mexican chocolate. This typifies a lot of craft efforts: not a great whiskey now, but one with terrifically interesting potential. I hope Wigle pursues this Whim. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
82,Hiram Walker Special Old Rye,40.0,Canadian,25,"Balance makes this simple session whisky a well-loved hot Sunday sipper, while searing pepper and vanilla-rich butterscotch lend it well to mixing. Order rye and ginger in a bar in Canada and you may well find yourself savoring Special Old. Toffee with hints of ginger on the nose broaden into blazing chilies with notes of cloves and cinnamon. Soft barrel notes, damp earth, and sweet toffee segue neatly into a very long, hot, bitter, cleansing finale. <em>(Canada only) </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2014
82,Celtic Cask Ceathair,46.0,Irish,155,"Originating from Cooley distillery, this whiskey spent a decade in a first-fill bourbon cask before a period of extra maturation in a Vinhos Barbeito madeira cask, and the influence is unmistakable on the nose. Additionally, there is vanilla icing, brown bananas, sprigs of wild mint, and a savory note of smoked duck. It’s a soft, buttery experience with honey, mandarin, guava, banana, and light spices. Dry, short, sweet finish but the Madeira tips the balance. (377 bottles) €125",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
82,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old bourbon from floor #9,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.



A much deeper, bolder, spicier, drier, and (at times) harsher bourbon when compared to the other two in this experiment, aged on the first and fifth floor. The wood influence (notes of barrel char, leather, and tannin) from the barrel dominate the pleasing sweet and fruit notes found in the other two. This is for those who like their bourbon with plenty of oak influence. Best served after a large, rich meal. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Fall 2014
82,Master of Malt Darkness! Benrinnes 15 year old PX Cask Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,101,"Another Benrinnes from the UK bottler’s new range, here the finish is more forceful, with masses of raisined sweetness, blueberry syrup, and molasses. The Benrinnes character adds weight and a firm earthy base, but this is more cask driven, slightly grippy, and for all the richness of the PX cask, the end result is a little bitter because of the treacle/molasses note. Fun certainly, but a bit over the top. £60/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
82,Exclusive Malts 1992 (distilled at Bladnoch),,Single Malt Scotch,150,"Maturation for this 21 year old bottling of Bladnoch occurred in a refill American oak hogshead. Sweet orchard fruits, new-mown hay, malt, and soft toffee on the nose. The palate is initially fruity, with more malt, then nuttiness develops, with aniseed and black pepper. The finish is relatively short and tannic. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
82,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dalmore) 13 year old 2000 Cask #6952,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Remarkably pale in color, this Exclusive Malt is a rare peated Dalmore. Peat reads more funky barnyard than smoke on the nose, with just a touch of sweetness behind it. The taste is much better than the smell, with the addition of smoke to the peat, intertwined with honey, salt, citrus, and ginger spice. The finish is slightly acidic and dry, far less satisfying than the mid-palate. There’s a reason why Dalmore doesn’t peat, but this release is still fascinating. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
82,Glenlivet Nadurra Oloroso,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,84,"I’m a fan of the original Nadurra’s freshness, which maximizes Glenlivet’s apple blossom and pineapple perfume. This pleasantly funky new brother has been matured wholly in <em>oloroso</em>, which adds (very) sweet sherry, nougat, blackcurrant, grilled pear, and malt. While the palate starts well, with mixed red and black fruits (and a little grapefruit), the sherry adds thickness from back palate on and the distillery slides away. Pleasant, but a tale of two halves. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive) £50 </em>",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
82,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glenrothes) 1990,,Single Malt Scotch,151,"Light gold. From a refill bourbon cask, here we have more marzipan and some light maltiness alongside very fresh fruit and delicate vanilla. This is Rothes in slightly lean and hungry mode, with its signature fruits and spices in the background. Needs water to smooth things out. When that happens, there’s lemon drizzle cake, leafiness, and walnut flour. A little short on the finish.  £90",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
82,Laphroaig Select,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,59,"A new, no age statement addition to the Laphroaig family that blends together Quarter Cask, PX, Triple Wood, and 10 year old. The nose is reminiscent of freshly-treated decking, before some classic iodine creeps in. Water brings out geranium, pollen, and damp leather. The palate is simple, clean, and mild (and smoky), with bay leaf, light dried fruit, and that oily wood. Undoubtedly there&#039;s a lot going on, but it’s not married, and 40% means it lacks the necessary wallop. £35",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
82,Master of Malt Reference Series II,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,"This laudable effort of comparative whiskies explores the effect of age by combining four parcels of stock in different proportions. The older whiskies produce an enticing nose of marmalade-encrusted ham on the bone, grist, and worn sandpaper. It’s sugary sweet with ripe melon before the sherry takes control and dishes out cherry candy and papaya. Held in the mouth, it develops layers of creamy latte and milk chocolate as the fruit fades. More to get your teeth into here. £54",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
82,Overeem Port Cask Matured #26,43.0,Australian Whisky,235,"A soft wadding of port gently prods the senses, producing a nose like a tincture from the hedgerows: redcurrant, raspberry, hawthorn, elderberry, and fresh, grassy notes with an accompaniment of waxed thornproof jackets, star anise, cardamom, and muted cloves. After maturation in 100-liter French oak quarter casks, the mouthfeel is thinner than expected. It’s like sinking your teeth into a slice of watermelon. There’s raspberry, Kola Kubes, and a touch of bitterness before a sticky finish. £140",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
82,J.T.S. Brown,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,13,"Despite the common Heaven Hill origin, this is not the same stuff as Dant. The nose is focused, dry, integrated: sweet corn, the inside of an old wooden drawer, and a flip of sweet spice. Lively in the mouth, almost playfully light: corn fritters and filigreed oak. If you mix this, go light; this is not a heavy bonded trooper. One cube, a small splash; then enjoy the delicacy.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
82,Lovell Bros. Georgia Sour Mash,,Craft Whiskey,28,"Unaged. Richly sweet with corn, and a bit of new make funk. Replicated very closely on the tongue: alcohol heat, corn sweetness, wild flowers/stems, and faint notes of overripe fruit, with some drying minerality on the finish. Interesting where it’s not clean; a balance of craft and cunning.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
82,The Irishman 12 year old Single Malt,43.0,Irish,70,"An aperitif-style aged Irish whiskey which plays in harmony with the fresh American oak bourbon casks. A light, fragrant nose of spring blossoms, waxed lemons, cinnamon sticks, pears in golden syrup, marshmallows, and fresh laundry. There is decent weight and structure here. Sharp acidity of peel scattered over lemon meringue pie, cinnamon, black pepper, and a finish of creamy fudge dipped in milk chocolate. Water pries open a hitherto-hidden waxy consistency (6,000 bottles released)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
82,Cardhu Amber Rock,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,69,"Bright gold. Very citric, sweet candied orange and tangerine marmalade, with a hint of pink grapefruit. As I said, citric. There’s meadow hay and some sherbet as well. Water brings out lucerne grass. The palate is equally delicate and ‘up,’ and quite acidic (no bad thing) with light, nutty chocolate and macadamia nut. When diluted, there’s poached pear and charred oak. The finish is effervescent. Light, easy-going, keenly priced. The rehabilitation of Cardhu continues. £41",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
82,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 105,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Silky and sweet up front, with English toffee and lush, bright, honeyed fruit.  But similar to the “Rye 90” release, leather and oak resin dominate the back end of the palate through the finish. More balance is needed to warrant a higher rating. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
82,"Amrut Port Pipe Peated Single Cask #2714, 59",,Indian Whisky,139,"Full port maturation has been tried by distilleries great and small. What does the cask contribute to the spirit beyond being soaked in port? Empress plums and bramble jelly meet smoke in the form of snuffed candlewicks and smoldering cedar sticks. At cask strength, it’s sharp and puckering but after the plummy opener fades there is rosehip, licorice, zested lime, and a squirt of lemon. Water keeps the licorice, but bottoms out the sweetness for a mouth-filling dram. £82",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
82,Catoctin Creek Mosby’s Spirit,40.0,Craft Whiskey,38,"The second craft rye I’m revisiting. Mosby’s is still 100% organic rye and unaged, but the nose is more fun: some green pear and melon esters in there with the grassy rye spice. It’s nicely smooth on the tongue, delivers exactly what the nose promised, plus a shot of fresh-cracked black pepper…and a much longer finish these days. Greatly improved; a good white whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
82,Stalk and Barrel Cask 12,,Canadian,92,"Still Waters distillery’s owners invited customers to select their next single cask release. Noting the soft cereal notes, stewed apples and raisins, and hot spices in an oily body, they recommended this one. A fruity nose with barrel tones and icing sugar blossoms in the glass while the hot, spicy palate shows hints of licorice, cloves, and vanilla. A good dash of water mollifies a drying tendency without dampening the flavor or creaminess. (<em>Distillery only) </em>C$100",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
82,Grand Macnish Sherry Cask 15 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"Naming your blend “Sherry Cask” retains an air of ambiguity to it. Theoretically, it could be the maturation or finishing vessel for all or some of the constituents. The whisky is light-bodied and the sweet sherry is evident, though a nip of bitterness interrupts. Smoother on the palate than the 12 year old, there’s strawberry, raspberry, and background spice, with a blackberry note late in the finish. Overall, there’s less flavor development, but it’s an old-school kind of blend.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
82,Strathclyde 12 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,73,"An official Strathclyde from Chivas Bros., presented in its squat bottle from their under-appreciated Cask Strength Edition series. I found a peculiar nose comprising shafts of lemongrass, garlic bulb, root ginger, taffy candy, and green tea. As an Iron Dram, it’s oily and bold, with coconut, fresh mint, and green pea, with a savory note tugging at the taste buds. Dilution highlights scallions, a light creamy toffee, and Reese’s peanut butter cups. Curiously intriguing: for bold flavor explorers only. £43",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
82,Catskill Fearless Wheat,,Craft Whiskey,35,"Sharp nose of fresh, wet grain, hot honey, a little butterscotch, crushed boxwood leaves, and a touch of linseed; an herbal smell. Mouth is roundly sweet, with honey and pie crust notes that meet the oak and pretty it up. There’s mint here, which surprised me; maybe from the wood? This one’s dainty, delicate, and maybe a bit too sweet, but it maintains an edge of oak that keeps it serious. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
82,Sons of Liberty Uprising,40.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"Malt whiskey with a mashbill similar to a craft-brewed stout—think dark roasted malts—and then aged in new charred oak with an addition of toasted French oak. The nose is sweet young malt touched with chocolate. There’s an additional hit of cocoa at first taste, then heat, oak, vanilla, and more sweet malt, followed by a finish that’s increasingly chocolatey and dry. Young, and could use more complexity and maturing, but full of good flavors. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
82,Celtic Honey Liqueur,30.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,22,"Following in the footsteps of Bushmills Irish Honey, Castle Brands tries their hand at a light and sweet Irish whiskey-based liqueur. Strong clover honey dominates with caramel, vanilla bean, cinnamon, and a little ginger spice. Hard to get to the base whiskey through all the sweet notes, but that seems to be the point. Just short of cloying, this is a whiskey-based liqueur for those more interested in the liqueur than the whiskey.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
82,The Knot,50.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,24,"William Grant’s answer to Drambuie is a much less sweet and higher proof Irish whiskey-based liqueur. Monster caramel leaps out of the glass with an undercurrent of cola. Caramel leads to chocolate on the palate before malt and grain whiskey undertones emerge. Mid-palate is a little hot, but it helps cut through the underlying sweetness and also features some botanicals like juniper and black pepper. Clearly a mixing spirit and probably best thrown into a cola or ginger ale.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
82,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Classic Malt,,Single Malt American Whiskey,100,"Two malts: same distillation run, same proof, but this one was aged in used bourbon barrels. The color is much lighter than the new barrel bottling (also reviewed this issue), a pale straw. Nose is delicate, notes of haymow planks, clover honey, fresh grain, and sweet orange peel. Somewhat pedestrian on the palate: sweet malt, dried hay, more citrus, and a touch of pepper, with a somewhat bitter finish. No real flaws, but no excitement either. Disappointing.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
82,Canadian Club Premium,40.0,Canadian,13,"Oh! The glory of new wood. Even dialed back from 6 years old to 5 this version pushes Canadian Club’s entry level mixing whisky into sippin’ territory. The century-old formula is unchanged, but brand new oak emphasizes the rye grain while injecting soft oak caramels and crispy bright barrel notes into the familiar, peppery, overripe dark fruit of one of the world’s longest continuously produced whiskies. A long gingery finish touches on sweet grapefruit and chili peppers.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
82,Filibuster Dual Cask Bourbon Batch No. 1,45.0,Craft Whiskey,42,"Aged in new charred oak, then finished in “white wine-seasoned French oak.” Tight, sawdusty, bitter nose. A lot of wood here, going in different directions. First hit is the American oak (vanilla, rich spice), followed quickly by creamy French oak, then comes a wave of fruity wine wood character. Full in the mouth, and a thick finish. Interesting, but not particularly well integrated; maybe a case of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
82,Defiant American Single Malt Whisky (Cask #6),41.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Aggressive nose of bitter orange, dark chocolate, and pine comes boiling out of the glass. More gentle on the palate: the same notes, but wrapped in sweet malt. A bit hot and crinkly on the tongue, an assertive whisky, but it fades quickly at the end. Good flavor, but a lack of depth; everything Defiant has is right there on top, there’s nothing to discover. The pine is off-putting, too; not sure where that’s coming from.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
82,Popcorn Sutton’s Tennessee White Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,25,"Clean nose, hard grain, some grassy sweetness, a bit perfumey. Interesting on the tongue: grain, sweet orange, and meadow grass; has a pleasantly creamy texture. Gets just a bit solvent-touched at the finish, but overall, an interesting sip…which brings up the question again: what are these ‘white whiskeys’ for? Cocktails, highballs, neat sipping? This one, I think, could pull off all three, the kind of white whiskey that compares to white rum. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
82,Cadenhead’s 11 year old (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,88,"Light and very creamy, with very subtle smoke in the background, this is like eating a white chocolate ice cream while walking toward a distant beach barbecue. The palate is gentle and sweet with good, refreshing saline balance. Water brings out mint. It’s just a little too tight and disconnected on the tongue.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
82,Glencadam The Rather Refined Port Wood Finish 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,56,"This Glencadam variant has been finished for 20 months in ruby port pipes. The result is a whisky that departs from its younger stablemate by offering a nose of rose petals, milk chocolate, stewed rhubarb, sweet red wine, and black pepper. The same ‘new paper’ note survives, however. Viscous on the palate; initially strawberries, then spicy milk chocolate, caramel, and candied cherries. Remaining sweet in the finish, with nutmeg and darker chocolate notes. £35",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
82,Stalk & Barrel Cask #4,46.0,Canadian,70,"Alberta’s Liquor Depot has chosen a tiny Ontario distillery for an exclusive single malt bottling. Still Waters, in Toronto, is Canada’s first craft distillery to bottle single malt whisky. This one is peppery hot and bathed in sweet barley sugar, clover honey, and rich oaky caramels. Brisk, nutty, and oaky, it remains sweet, with green pears. A weighty body, with grassiness, dry grain, and hot white pepper, typifies Still Waters’ emerging house style. (<i>Alberta only.) </i>C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
82,Stalk & Barrel Cask #5,,Canadian,95,"This sweet, peppery dram secures Still Waters’ reputation for single malt prodigies: young whiskies mature beyond their years. Cinnamon, enhanced by mild herbal bitterness, rides waves of barley sugar. Sweetness and heat grow stronger as the whisky sits in your mouth. Water brings grassiness to the nose and cooked cream of wheat to the palate. Mid-palate hints of celery add breadth while linseed oil, earthy blue clay, and hints of eucalyptus linger in a long peppery finish. (<i>U.S. only.)</i>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
82,Singleton of Dufftown Reserve Collection Unité,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"Very Singleton of Dufftown: while that means easy drinking and approachable, it also

can suggest a single malt without a spark of wayward genius. This is,

typically, very ordered: nuts and honey with malt and pecan pie underneath. As

it opens there’s dried lemon, oak, dried fig, and (dilute) pencil shavings. The

palate is—typically—sweet and thick, though here with a refreshing sharpness,

like a mix of wine gums and cider. I’d add a rock or two of ice. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive) </i>£38/1 liter",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
82,Shieldaig Classic,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,18,"In blended whisky terms, this isn’t for the faint-hearted, and joins a number of recent releases prepared to show off its

darker, grittier side. It’s a big flavored blend, with its heart in the islands, and with oily coastal notes reminiscent of a delicatessen: brine, salty cheese, some crab apple relish, and smoked fish. It’s a rugged bruiser, but it makes its mark with some style.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
82,Monarch of The Glen 8 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,15,"Standard blends fall into two categories: those that will behave nicely when mixed to offer almost non-whisky experience, and those that are feistier and want to make sure you know they’re there. This is the former, and with whiskies like this one, it’s possible to blink and miss it. That doesn’t make it bad; just indistinctive and unexceptional. There is little sign of the wood here, but the delicate, sweet apricot notes just do enough.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
82,Paddleford Creek Small Batch,,Bourbon/Tennessee,21,"No age statement, “charcoal filtered.” Hard candy/sweet-spicy nose with some wood edginess, stewed corn, and mineral notes; not particularly well-integrated. The thin body flashes vanilla and light caramel across the tongue as some hot oak fires things up. On the lean side, and like most such bourbons, the finish lingers, and flares at each swallow: oak, cinnamon, and that same mineral note. Not bad, but it needs more. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
82,Two Stars,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,21,"Simple nose of sweet cornbread and oaky caramel; nothing fancy, but nothing wrong. The nose is no liar; same tastes in the

mouth, just a bit hotter on the oak. Good finish with a nice oaky linger. The letdown is the thin body, which adds to the heat and steals from the experience. Seems more like a good shot bourbon or an “…and ginger ale” bourbon, not a sipping bourbon. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
82,Tullibardine 225 Sauternes,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Tullibardine 225 Sauternes is finished in Sauternes dessert wine casks from Chateau Suduiraut in Bordeaux, and the nose majors in citrus fruits, vanilla, pepper, and a discreet herbal note. Citrus fruits carry through to the spicy palate, with Jaffa orange to the fore, plus malt. Spicy to the very end, with milk chocolate and a suggestion of passion fruit.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
82,Dry Fly Port Finish Wheat,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Wheat whiskey, finished in huckleberry port barrels, showing a deep reddish blush, purple-pink around the edges. The fruity richness of the portwood is subdued, but present, and lays across everything else in the nose. Things become less one-dimensional on the palate, and the sweet broad grassiness of the wheat lightens the portwood influence somewhat, but it comes back in the finish. It’s a decent combo, but a bit of a one-note song. Price is per 375ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
82,Samish Bay Single Malt Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Made in Washington State with Washington barley in a copper pot still, and aged “over a year” in new, charred, 10 gallon oak barrels. Good color; nose is frisky and young, with fresh oak and big pear aromas, and a hot feel. Hot and direct in the mouth: grainy, some of that pear, and a somewhat bland but appealing cereal sweetness. Finish is more of the same, with a flick of heat at the end. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
82,1910,40.0,Canadian,33,"12 year old 100% Canadian rye-grain whisky is transported from Canada to Hood River Distillers’ plant in Oregon where, after adding glacier water from Mt. Hood, it is bottled. Tart lime juice, ginger, and seething pepper brighten a rich combination of vanilla, butterscotch, and maple fudge. Crisp charred oak meets wet slate as raisins meld into floral notes with tinges of Canada balsam and fresh-cut pine. This rich, weighty, well-balanced whisky is decidedly fresh and exuberant.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
82,Adelphi (distilled at Longmorn) 20 year old 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,,"With Longmorn, you are always looking for a dense, sweet fruitiness. This doesn’t disappoint on the nose, where there’s moist compacted fruitcake with marzipan, Brazil nut, glacé cherry, a hint of tobacco, then hard toffee. The palate is soft to start but then an overly firm grip and slightly bitter edges come through. Though water improves it, the oak is slightly too dominant. That said, the nose is superb. £80 ",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
82,St. George's Founder's Private Cellar Peated Sauternes Cask 0787,,Single Malt English Whisky,,"Uh-oh. If I see the word “peated” with a sweet wine, I get nervous. As a mix, this is an accident waiting to happen; a great acrobatic trick that probably won't work. Two points here: one, the distillery is defining its citrusy and gritty DNA despite the diversity of releases. Two, this also pulls its punches…but it works. Yes, it's very sweet and liqueury, and yes there's peat — quite industrial here — but they stand on opposite sides of the dance floor and don't fight. £148",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
82,Black Velvet Toasted Caramel,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Canadian whisky is sweeter to start with, and so may well be a natural base for flavors. It certainly seems that way with this underpriced example. The nose is like restrained caramel candy, a fairly deep note of toasted sugar. The drink itself is sweet, but doesn’t cling, and is crying for a bit of fizz, or some ice cream to drape itself over. Not bad at all for the price. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
82,Jack Daniel’s Unaged Rye,40.0,Rye Whiskey,,"Clear as Cave Spring water, a mashbill of 70&#37; rye, “mellowed” by charcoal, and ignorant of barrel-aging. It is white dog-brash: fresh wet grain, trampled grass, and a salty tinge. The spirit is pleasurably smooth and cool, sweet in body with a bitter film of rye spice. A gentlemanly clear spirit that’s itching to get into a cocktail; my only real complaint is the price. (This is “a taste of what’s to come,” so expect an aged rye to follow.)",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
82,John David Albert’s Taos Lightning Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Like the other Taos Lightning Rye, there’s an MGP provenance that’s topped with local aging; it is stated to be a 5 year old whiskey. There’s the signature brittle-dry mint of this mashbill, some hot oak and shortbread. The mouth is quick, spicy, and hot, but not over-balanced in any direction. Good, but not setting off the shock and awe.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
82,Myer Farm White Dog,,Craft Whiskey,,"An estate white whiskey: the corn in this spirit was all grown and harvested on the Myer farm, a Finger Lakes farm dating back to the 1860s. The nose is clean and green, a focused blast of unmodified corn. The spirit is zesty and fresh, sweet and grassy/minty; easy to hold on the tongue until a final heat that fires the finish. If the finish were a bit smoother…still quite good for unaged whiskey.  ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
82,XXX Shine,,Craft Whiskey,,"Unaged corn whiskey from Philadelphia. The distinctive white corn spirit smell: crushed corn leaves, wet cornmeal, hint of fruit and split stone. A singular flavor, though: the usual flabby, green sweetness isn’t here. Instead, there’s a dry, solid corn flavor, something that tastes complete, arrived. I could ask for more complexity, but the focused, dry intensity of it has a singular appeal, asking only ice — or a lager chaser — to make a great afternoon.  ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
82,Teeling Poitín,,Miscellaneous,39,"I&#039;m really excited that new world whiskey makers and independents are challenging the way we think about whiskey. But there are concerns, too, such as flavored whiskeys, and white spirit sold as the finished article. Poitín is an Irish pauper&#039;s spirit made illegally, so legal definitions are patchy. It is normally made with potatoes. This is a mix of new make Irish single malt and new make Irish grain. It tastes like new make Irish whiskey. End of story.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
82,T.J. Pottinger Sugar*Shine,50.0,Miscellaneous,,"Not cheap sugar “squeezins,” this is mashed from 50% corn and 50% cane sugar, run on an alembic still by two Beams whose great-grandfathers were J.W. Dant and Minor Case Beam: some credibility. Clear as glass, a big corn nose tinged with light caramel and violets. Nicely sweet and warm, grassy-fresh and east to hold in the mouth. Clean, straightforward stuff. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
82,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach) 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Another catch-up from G&M, this time from the ‘Beast of Dufftown.’ Immediate substance and solidity, which is what you want from Mortlach, but there’s also thick-cut marmalade and cumin. Only with water, however, does the classic meatiness emerge—like a lamb tangine with apricot. A cleaner, slightly lighter side to the Flora & Fauna 16 year old, but with heft and a burnt licorice sweetness. A great introduction to a classic distillery.",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
82,Berkshire Bourbon,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"There’s a hot, brittle nose of sweet spice, like a cinnamon Red Hot floating in alcohol, with a softer backing of cornmeal underneath. This is a well-behaved bourbon in the mouth; no off-flavors, easy to hold on the tongue, with more corn than spice now, and a lack of wood until the finish, when it wraps in on the corn to dry things up a bit. Simple, sweet, a little spicy, and really easy to drink; a good start.  ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
82,Glenglassaugh Revival,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The first widely-available single malt from the revived distillery of Glenglassaugh, Revival comprises spirit from both first and refill casks, finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for a period of six months. Initially a little mashy, with beer-like aromas. Quite sweet and mildly sherried, with developing roasted malt notes, ginger, hazelnuts, and caramel. Leather and insistent spice on the palate, majoring in nutmeg and cinnamon. Straightforward in the finish; spicy and nutty. Probably a crackerjack in another dozen years!",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
82,Black Velvet,40.0,Canadian,,"Standard bottling benchmark. Smells sweet, caramel and toffee, with some alcohol heat and a slight medicinal twang. Strong caramel flavor (is that where that rich amber color came from?), not particularly deep or complex, but not hot or flawed either, leading to a gentle sweet finish. Not bad at all for a mixing whisky.  ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
82,Oban 14 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A much-beloved malt in the U.S. Some say it’s because it is easy to pronounce (though having said that, remember it’s ‘OH-bin’ and not ‘O’Bahn’). I’d prefer to think its popularity is because there is something about the fresh cleanliness of the nose, its orange oils, chocolate, and zesty-zingy and yes, occasionally salty spiciness that is instantly appealing.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
82,John B. Stetson,42.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Easy-going and uncluttered, but also not very complex. Balanced, straightforward notes of caramel, vanilla, creamed corn, subtle fruit, soft mint, and delicate cinnamon. A versatile bourbon: you won’t feel guilty using it in a cocktail, and it will do in a pinch to drink neat or with a splash of water.  ",John Hansell,Summer 2012
82,Corsair Nashville,50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Mashbill of corn, smoked barley, rye, and wheat, and a ruddy, almost garnet color to it. Smells like barrel drool in a rickhouse; kinda raunchy and sweet, with broad notes of vanilla and hot corn. Quite a mouthful at 100 proof, and after a short initial wave of sweet, the smoke shouts through, squeezing and wringing the other flavors dry, right through the finish. Water makes it paradoxically hotter. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
82,Balcones Texas Single Malt Special Release (Batch 1182/1285),,Craft Whiskey,,"Quite dark brown in the glass, and lots of vanilla and fruit — white grapes, pear — in the nose, with a sweet, clean floral character as well; a rich nose. Vibrant with malt and vanilla in the mouth, rather hot without water, and shot through with oakspice, which dominates the finish, though the vanilla struggles through. Water helps the heat in the middle, but not the finish. Texas is pretty darned hot!",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
82,"Reservoir Rye Whiskey Year II, Batch 6",50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A restrained nose of fresh-cut oak, grassy rye, and a fleeting trace of solvents. Quite sweet in the mouth, spicy and minty, and the alcohol is fiery: this is young rye. Still, it's much less forward and rudely insistent than I'd expected; not at all the ripsnorter some young ryes are. This could be pleasant, but the finish is a letdown: sweet, mealy, uninspiring.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
82,Spirit of Hven Rackafallsbyn Single Malt,45.0,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,179,"There are now fourteen distilleries in Sweden. This is the second one after Mackmyra to start bottling whisky, and it&#039;s rather good. It&#039;s clearly young, but there are big flavors here, including blackcurrant and rich citrus fruits early on, then a Highland-style earthiness toward the end, with distinctive peat lasting longest into the finish. There is a lot to like here, and with age the line between fruit and peat will become more blurred. 1295 SEK",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
82,The Dalmore 1995 Distillery Manager’s Exclusive,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"This 1995 vintage is exclusively available from Whisky Shop in the UK. The whisky was selected by distillery manager Ian Mackay and his team, and matured in Matusalem sherry and American white oak casks. 1,800 bottles are available. Worn leather, candied orange, malt, and cinnamon on the nose. Spicy orange, sherry, mixed nuts, and licorice on the palate. The finish is slowly drying, with dark chocolate and smoky caramel notes. £85",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
82,Revel Stoke,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Spice nose, but some alcohol notes put a hot twist to it. A blast of baking spices — nutmeg, anise, allspice, mace — hits the palate, along with shots of citrus and vanilla that take a while to get organized and settled down, leading to a sweet finish where the orange dominates. If Spicebox is a fireside drink, this is a snowy woods outdoors drink; a bit hotter, more rustic, more rough. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
82,Wemyss The Peat Chimney 12 year old,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The problem with selling your whisky by description is that if you don't deliver what you've claimed in the name, you're in trouble. That's a little bit how it was with these whiskies when they were seven years old. At this age, though, these are big boy whiskies and there is plenty of peat, seaweed, oil, barbecued fish, and salty sea notes to keep you hooked. Nicely balanced with fruit, too.  £35",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
82,Master of Malt Speyside Single Malt 30 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Master of Malt is an online whisky retailer, branching out with its own bottlings. This, from an unnamed distillery, is lightly honeyed with some quince, apricot, and yellow plum, while there’s a mix of vanillin and dry bracken/grass behind. Light, clean, and balanced, the palate is refined and relaxed with Demerara-like sweetness and a finish of honey-coated nuts. I wanted more oomph on the palate, which might have come at 43% or 46%. £100",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
82,New Holland Zeppelin Bend,45.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),,"Young malt whisky. A rich but jumbled nose: cocoa, ripe grape, oak, and vanilla tumble and fight for your attention. A nicely rounded lighter whiskey in the mouth, though, and the cocoa cradles malt sweetness quite nicely...until the oak tears up the finish with a blast of hot spice. You almost want to keep sipping continuously to keep the finish from cutting in. Price is per 375ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
82,Cedar Ridge Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Thin corn sweetness, nice splash of mint and cinnamon. The whiskey's warm, but not hot, and it's exceptionally smooth. There's a slice of rye spice, and oaky vanilla, and the finish is clean and sweet. But it's almost too smooth, and not gutsy enough; if Stagg is bourbon turned up to eleven, this is at about six and a half. Cedar Ridge has a great start here; now show me more.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
82,Delaware Phoenix Rye Whiskey,50.0,Rye Whiskey,,"Dark, hot brown sugar, sweet peppermint candy. A hot rye burner, but moderate on the palate: the heat's here, but the flavors come through clearly, in waves of mint, sugar, oily clove, and a brittle, sweet finish. This is no lapdog, but neither is it a clumsy, huge puppy; there's real rye character, the rough spots smoothed off by wood. A good young rye.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
82,McKenzie Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Sharpish nose, hot corn, peppermint, a bit of grape, and underlying cocoa. Sweet mouthful of vanilla and corn, the cocoa's here, and some oakspice. Finish is a bit rough and hot, but not unpleasant. This works better than the sherry-assisted takeoff of their rye whiskey. Could be more rounded, but it's well-constructed and solid.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
82,Sazerac Rich & Rare Reserve,40.0,Canadian,,"Sweet Canadian whisky nose, taffy, some vanilla. Taste is fairly rich, with notes of port and light cocoa, leading to a clean finish with a good grip. Not a tremendously deep whisky, but approachable and free of flaws. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
82,Wild Turkey 81,,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"Comprised of bourbon aged 6 to 8 years old (and seems closer to 6 than 8). This new, fairly bold for 81 proof whiskey, while drinkable neat or with a splash of water, really works best as a mixer. Very traditional bourbon notes of caramel, vanilla, mint, cinnamon, sweet corn, and orchard fruit.",John Hansell,Fall 2011
82,Inchgower 14 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"You could argue that there’s an element of auto-suggestion at work when you pick up saltiness in Inchgower, after all, it comes from a fishing port (Buckie). But taste it blind and there it is — an unmistakable salinity on nose and palate which, when combined with lemon accents, cumin seed, thin fruit syrups, and green grapes, makes this an intense, perfect, aperitif. £37 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
82,Tomatin Decades,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This bottling celebrates distillery manager Douglas Campbell’s 50 years of service at Tomatin, and includes casks from 1967, 1976, 1984, and 1990, along with a peated Tomatin from 2005. The nose is initially slightly musty, with faint peat smoke, sweetening to mild vanilla, with new leather and peaches in time. Full-bodied, relatively dry on the palate, with the European oak casks in the ascendancy here. Raisins, dark chocolate, and licorice. Medium to long in the finish, drying, with spicy oak. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
82,St. George’s Chapter 11,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"It was perhaps inevitable that a distillery employing whisky legend Iain Henderson would sooner or later release a heavily peated version of English whisky. Ironically, this is the first release on which current distiller David Fitt has tweaked Henderson’s recipe. He has not let anyone down. The peat doesn’t hide the sappy youthfulness here, but complements the sweet, creamy, malty heart, building with pepper to good effect. Another step in the right direction for this intriguing distillery. £45 (Currently not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
82,Drayman’s Highveld Single Cask (Cask No. 10),47.0,South African Whisky,,"The man behind this whisky is an acclaimed craft brewer, and on the strength of his early efforts this intriguing distillery is going to be winning plaudits from the world of whisky before too long. This single cask bottling steps over the hurdle of youthful sappy barley at its core, thanks to a big dose of wine-influenced spirit, which is liqueur-like; rich, full, and heavily berried. The killer, though, is the way the whisky goes up through the spice gears. €48 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
82,Hazelburn CV,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Hazelburn CV is the non-age-statement version of Springbank’s unpeated, triple distilled single malt, introduced in 2010 to accompany the existing 8 and 12 year old variants. Initially slightly mashy and herbal on the nose, with acetone and cigarette packets. Citric and more malty with time. Orange, ginger, vanilla, and sherbet zest on the spicy palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with a slight suggestion of salt. A fresh, breezy, aperitif dram. £33 (Not available in the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
82,Three Ships 10 Year Old Limited Edition,43.0,South African Whisky,,"South Africa’s most established distillery now makes Scotch-style single malt whisky that the country can be proud of. The downside is that it plays it safe, and the flavors on offer are subdued and subtle. That said though, there’s plenty to like here — delicate floral notes including rose, with a rich and honeyed heart, traces of exotic fruits including kumquat and kiwi, wispy smoke, and some cinnamon and paprika. Solid. €47.50 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
82,"Ben Nevis 1998, Duncan Taylor NC2 range",46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Initially mulch and damp undergrowth on the nose, with a whiff of sulfur. Then developing soft toffee and vanilla notes, though the ‘outdoors’ odor remains. Big and oily in the mouth, with a chewy texture. Oak, citrus fruit, hazelnuts, and spices, plus a hint of gunpowder tea. Medium to long in the finish, with more oak, ginger, and quite bitter coffee. A typically ‘off the rails’ independent Ben Nevis. Great if you have a soft spot for a ‘bad boy!’ ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
82,Greenore 18 year old,46.0,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,,"Greenore is the grain whisky produced by Cooley, and as an 8 year old and a 15 year old it has proved to be a world beater.  Now it’s being marketed as the oldest Irish single grain whiskey in the world, and while there’s lots to recommend, this age might be a step too far. Lashings of banana and vanilla ice cream are up front, but then sharp salt and pepper slash across it and leave an astringent, puckerish mixed finish. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
82,Mackmyra Bruckswhisky,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"This may well be the perfect entry level Mackmyra. It has a lower strength, and is almost Mackmyra Lite, thinner and less peaky, peppery, and peaty than every other Mackmyra bottling. There’s a green fruit, almost gooseberry dimension to this; most unusual for the distillery, and the peaty underlay is fractured and dusty rather than sharp and intense. A revelation, and proof that the distillery is branching out. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
82,The Notch,,Single Malt American Whiskey,,"The price, the proof, and 8 years of age reflect the source: the Triple 8 distillery. Light fruit — white grapes, nectarine — and a bit of resiny plastic in the nose, plus a hint of wine wood, underlain by malt. Clean malt in the mouth, well-integrated with nothing sticking out or unbalanced. The fruit’s still there, but diminished; finish is a little clingy but clean. Nicely-made whisky…but it’s like a really good dish of vanilla ice cream; is that all? ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
82,Canadian Club Reserve,40.0,Canadian,,"A bit of heat, faint nose of putty, light brown sugar, and fully ripe grapes. Stand-up whisky: sweet grain, a bit of rye spice, oak notes, and a good release on the finish. Just a touch of hollow sweetness in the middle, a kind of flat spot.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
82,Canadian Club Sherry Cask,,Canadian,,"8 years old and sherry finished, and it shows in the darker color. Sweet dark fruit aromas; a bit sugary. Waxy fruit and caramel, wood spice, and some oaky prickliness on center tongue as the whisky fades. More interesting than the standard, but a bit thick.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
82,Deanston Virgin Oak,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Finished in virgin oak casks, so I would expect to find some wood influence here somewhere. Indeed I do, particularly on the finish. There’s no age statement, but on the nose it comes across as a bit youthful. Honeyed vanilla, lemon, pear, fresh-cut grass, and wood shavings on the nose. More of the same on the palate, with sweet notes to the fore, and virgin oak influence (wood shavings, polished leather, and a firm oak grip). Very individualistic, but the flavors don’t seem fully integrated. (Perhaps a bit more aging in non-virgin casks?)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
83,Cask & Crew Blended Rye (Batch 1),40.0,Rye Whiskey,25,"A blend of 51% 3 year old Canadian rye and 49% aged American corn whiskey. It has aromas of peanut shell, tea leaf, dill, mint, Popsicle stick, and bags of grain at the general store. The light-bodied palate is redolent of pencil shavings, chamomile, dried Turkish mint, and oaky spice, finishing very quickly.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
83,Still Austin Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Citrus oil, freshly cut wood, tea leaves, baking spice, and maple candy on the nose; with water added, more herbal and floral notes emerge, including mint, star anise, and fresh chamomile. Medium-bodied, the palate has orange peel, licorice, star anise, brown sugar, and plenty of fresh oak; here, adding water doesn&#039;t benefit the balance. It finishes quickly, with black pepper, oak, and more star anise.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
83,Firestone & Robertson TX Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Led by raw grain and new oak on the nose, it also has aromas of cedar, spiced almonds, green banana, and marshmallow. The palate shows plenty of wood, with pulling tannins, as well as black pepper, vanilla, orange, and bitter almond. It’s more oak and grain on the finish, which fades quickly. Some promising qualities here, but this whiskey needs more time in the barrel.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
83,Spirits of French Lick Lee W. Sinclair Four Grain Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Made with an unusual mashbill—corn, wheat, caramel malt, and oats—this whiskey was aged for 2 years. Grain, bread dough, almond paste, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. The palate has fresh wood shavings, cinnamon, bread dough, orange Popsicle, and walnuts, with a dry chocolate and oak finish. A bit more maturation time should soften some of the youthful edges.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
83,Catoctin Creek Rabble Rouser Bottled in Bond Rye,50.0,Rye Whiskey,90,"Peanut taffy, licorice, black pepper, tarragon, and lemon vie with Popsicle stick and a bit of solvent on the nose. The palate is laden with herbs—anise, licorice, tarragon, and basil—as well as cubeb, black pepper, and cough syrup. There are some enjoyable flavors here, but heavy-handed oak throws things off-balance.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
83,Darby’s Reserve Small Batch,45.0,Rye Whiskey,22,"Roasted lemon and orange peels, grilled apples, nutmeg, ginger, and Popsicle stick on the nose. Citrus-flavored hard candies, cinnamon, cloves, iced tea, apple skins, and drying wood on the palate, which takes water well. This is simple, wood-forward, and immature, but the flavors are pleasant. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
83,Braddock Oak Single Barrel (Batch #T517K6),46.0,Rye Whiskey,40,"With spearmint, licorice, dried flowers, cedar, and new oak on the nose, it’s no surprise to taste a wood-forward palate. Iced tea with orange peel, spearmint, grain, sweet cedar, and drying oak lead into a finish of menthol, dark cocoa, and shoe polish. Youthful, with some rough edges, but enjoyable. Distilled by Catoctin Creek from 100% rye. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
83,Cleveland Black Reserve Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The nose is grainy with strong wood notes and hints of vanilla, lilac, and cinnamon candies. Flavors of caramel, vanilla, spice, and citrus tussle with cedar, tea leaves, and oak tannins before a lengthy, assertive finish of tobacco, caramel, cinnamon, clove, and orange peel.

83,Relativity American Whisky (prototype),40.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),35,"Generously woody with pencil shavings and lumber mingled with chamomile, white flowers, and vanilla on the nose. The light-bodied palate is sweet and floral, with cloying milk chocolate, toasted coconut, and vanilla flavors. It’s just a bit simple and boring.

83,Wyoming Double Cask Sherry Finished Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,60,"Pale gold in color. Generous oak imparts honeycomb, white chocolate, vanilla custard, and some mint notes that hint of a delicate, pretty bourbon. The palate is a bit deeper, displaying chocolate, berry fruit, and Bit-O-Honey candy; quite confectionary with sweet marshmallow fluff. A pleasing and interesting whiskey worth trying, but feels just a bit disjointed.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
83,High West Valley Tan (Batch 3),,Craft Whiskey,50,"Wheat has been swapped for oats in this release, but the agenda remains the same, a very primary whiskey with grain at the forefront and just a hint of oak roundness to the surprisingly creamy palate. Fresh flour, violet candies, hints of clove spice, and persistent sweetness, the palate gives the impression of warm breakfast cereal laced with banana and lemon, a testament to the quality of the distillate.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
83,White Oak Akashi Japanese Single Malt,46.0,Japanese,100,"A winsome, floral nose, with icing sugar, green tea, sweet toffee, and juicy fruits including apricot, dragon fruit, and ripe watermelon. The honey-fruity core of tangerine, watermelon, orange oils, Starburst candies, and a little caramel imports attractive flavors, the balance and complexity given heft by the white pepper and dried chili notes. The drawback is the lack of body and texture. The end brings a flurry of pepper and burnt oak, and a long tail of melon and spices.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
83,Throttle2Bottle,40.0,Canadian,21,"Sweeter on the nose than the palate, with crème caramel, autumn fruits, and sweet rye spices. Initial caramel notes become peppery, with raging heat that glows in the throat. A creamy mouthfeel works hard to resist this incursion of hot rye spices and searing cayenne pepper. Feels hotter than 40%, with sizzling spices but no alcohol burn. Fruity notes come and go, centered on cooked apples. Eventually fades to a long, sourish, bitter-orange finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
83,Wolfhead Craft,40.0,Canadian,26,"Reminiscent of old-style sherry malts, with round, mellow, oaky notes and a dusty, waxy, farmy feel that evolves into dark fruit and striking gunpowder on the nose. Odd and enticing. The oily palate shows taffy, blistering white pepper, fresh pine sawdust, and ripe fruits, with chocolatey suggestions of Tootsie Rolls. Starts big, then moves to a quick, spicy-hot resolution. People who think all-wheat whisky is mild or weak really need to try this luscious beauty. $35 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
83,Bruichladdich Octomore 07.4 Virgin Oak,,Single Malt Scotch,195,"Distilled in 2008 from barley peated to 167 ppm and matured in virgin French oak casks. Sweet smoke and oak on the initial nose, with quite assertive spices. Freshly sawn timber, dried fruits, and emerging vanilla. Slightly earthy on the palate, where big spice notes continue with peaches, orange, and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively long, with cloves, licorice, ginger, and chili. Bold is the word! (12,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
83,Redemption Barrel Proof 9 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Warmth. Bakery flavors set in right away, illustrating both sweet and spice: cinnamon bread, vanilla, yellow cake batter, gingersnaps, no-bake oatmeal cookies. Then, hints of smoke, dark cherries, chipotle pepper, and a slight hint of butterscotch. As is, it disappointingly finishes short, with a hint of cardamom. Water adds caramel complexity to the previously short finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
83,Bruichladdich Micro Provenance 2007 (Cask 14),,Single Malt Scotch,117,"The Micro Provenance series is Bruichladdich’s web-exclusive range of single cask bottlings. This is made from barley grown on Rockside Farm (now owned by Kilchoman) and has been aged in virgin oak. The oak doesn’t dominate the nose, allowing fresh cereal sweetness to develop, along with an estery lift and some jasmine/meadowsweet florals. The palate is where creamy vanilla and white chocolate show through. Fresh, balanced, and bottled at the right time. (468 bottles) £90",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
83,Deanston 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,135,"This 18 year old was matured in refill hogsheads before a period of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is light and fruity with pears, melon, and mild vanilla, plus caramel and a hint of toffee. Rich and full on the textured palate, with big orchard fruits, honey, buttery spice notes, then emerging aniseed. Dries in the finish, with plain chocolate and slightly tannic oak notes, plus a sprinkling of chili heat.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
83,The Singleton of Glendullan Master’s Art,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,160,"Glendullan has reimagined itself with a trio of Travel Retail exclusives. This, the most expensive, has been given some secondary maturation in Muscat wine casks. It’s the most complex of the trio, with more citric elements, hints of hay, and some spice, while the richness and dried scented fruit of the Muscat is a good accompaniment to the sloe-like side of the distillery character. A thick vanilla component helps the palate along to a chocolatey finish.",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
83,Stalk & Barrel Blue Label Blend,40.0,Canadian,26,"This mingling of Still Waters’ own mature corn, rye, and malt whiskies with undisclosed, sourced base whisky is sweeter and punchier than the Stalk &amp; Barrel White Label blend it replaces. Clear malt notes, soft caramels, apple juice, and mild sweet flowers on the nose. The palate shows oak caramels, vanilla, and some mild white pepper. Becomes very zesty in the mouth, with a long, peppery, pulling finish. A pleasing but fairly simple whisky, more for mixing than sipping. C$33",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
83,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Invergordon) 28 year old 1987,,Single Grain Whisky,110,"Sweet top notes of brioche loaf with baking spices, but there are savory flavors of pastrami bark lurking deep in the glass. Flavors of golden syrup and butterscotch unfurl beautifully from within the thick texture at cask strength. Roasted spices explode, but as it dilutes, stewed fruits and sucked boiled candy notes are found. Water emphasizes confectionary elements and purple fruits, but kills the spices stone dead. Dry, spicy heat on the finish. (490 bottles) £85",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
83,Sons of Liberty Uprising Pedro Ximénez Sherry Finish (Batch 2),46.0,Craft Whiskey,30,"The nose of this mahogany-hued ‘single-malt’ portends dense and chewy flavors of brown sugar, dates, and toasted walnuts. It’s a bit fiery on the palate, where it unleashes a rush of dried fruits, smoke, and spice. While some raw spirit character peeks through, this unconventional whiskey holds appeal for its originality, with a stout-like crescendo of coffee and mocha on the very long finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
83,Boondocks 11 year old,,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"Light straw color, but its rich aroma contradicts its youthful color. Marshmallow and cotton candy really come out strong, quickly followed by decadent bakery aromas. Fresh-baked muffins, heavy whipping cream, and vanilla icing, with hints of caramelized barley and nutmeg. Its weaknesses are a slightly adhesive mouthfeel and short finish, but the pronounced flavors still make it a borderline sipper or a just-add-water whiskey. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
83,John Myer Four Grain,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Mashbill of 47% corn, followed by rye, wheat, and barley. Aromas of golden fruit with grassy freshness (hay and floral notes) turn a bit more plump and juicy on the palate, with apricot, raspberry, and some tropical fruit—pineapple and mango—emerging. Orange-peel citrus character is lifted by white pepper spice before the oak-laden, leathery, drying finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
83,Union Horse Distilling Reserve Straight Bourbon (Batch 1),46.0,Craft Whiskey,37,"Aged up to 5 years, this whiskey serves up lots of fresh, oaky sawdust with its caramel and toffee, along with some varnish notes. Aromas of spice and smoke lead to a palate of butterscotch, smooth and oily in texture, with robust, warming spice and a dry, leathery, and tannic finish. Nice maturity and polish for the price.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
83,House of Hazelwood 21 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,98,"A spicier character to represent 1920s Bombay (now Mumbai) yields an intriguing nose of cumin, dried apple, cardamom, and roasted coriander seed, walnut shells, dry meat from the tandoor, and aged cigars in Spanish cedar. A rather gluey texture with a dominant cinnamon note, interjected by spicy fruit from the European oak and gentle cloves. A short finish leaves a reverberation of spices and chicory root. The aromas are wonderful, but it comes unstuck with the mouthfeel. £75",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
83,Singleton of Glen Ord 18 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,119,"One in the trio of age-stated Singleton of Glen Ords, this 18 year old has a nose of sultanas, hazelnuts, sherry, vanilla, and a note of pine. Silky on the full palate, with vanilla, milk chocolate, sherry, and caramel. The lengthy finish is drying, with licorice and chili. RM481",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
83,Popcorn Sutton Barrel Finished,46.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"“Spirits distilled from grain and sugar” on the label, and the word “whiskey” is nowhere to be seen, but we’ve stretched the definition before; and this stuff tasted okay unaged. Smells like oak candy wrapped in fresh leaves. A bit hot, but like warm cereal on the tongue, and the oak fills in the back. Sippable, and likely to make a good Old-Fashioned as well.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
83,"Douglas Laing Old Particular 10 year old (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory)",,Single Malt Scotch,69,"This 10 year old peated expression from Tobermory distillery on Mull was matured in a single refill hogshead and bottled in January 2016. Medicine chests, sweet smoke, ginger, and apple on the nose, with damp earth. The palate provides a big hit of peaty spice, seaweed, black pepper, ginger, and dark berries. Becoming slightly bitter in the drying, ashy, medium-length finish. (349 bottles) £48",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
83,Coppersea Excelsior Bourbon,48.0,Craft Whiskey,100,"Fresh grains and sawn oak on the nose, with some green grass and stalks. Spicy, fresh flavors of corn and oak, along with a doughy softness that contrasts with the 48% ABV heat. There’s a somewhat bosky note of leaves and duff, a salty cracker component, and a medicinal hint; the almost herbal complexity I’ve come to expect from Coppersea. Interesting, tasty, well off the beaten bourbon path.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
83,Wolfburn Single Malt,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"The first release from Wolfburn distillery is 3 years old. Matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak quarter casks previously used by an Islay distillery. The nose is soft and belies its youth, offering vanilla, lemon, ginger, and light smoke. The early palate is grassy. Sweeter fruit notes soon develop with more vanilla and ginger, plus white pepper. The finish is quite long and slightly smoky. Much to look forward to as this ages!",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
83,Inchmurrin 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,111,"The nose offers less rich, peachy fruit than the 12 year old. More perfumed, with toasted marshmallows. Silky and sweet on the palate, with tinned pears and pineapple, plus developing toffee and oak. The finish is quite long, with persistent ginger, drying slightly. £77",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
83,Wemyss Malts Spice King,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,54,"This NAS version is a little smokier than before, with ground pepper, toasted coriander and fennel seeds, and a dusting of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light initially; early orange and lime flavors are extinguished quickly. Warm cocoa, malt, chocolate shavings, black cherry, raspberry bubblegum, and concentrated dark fruits complement restrained spices and faint smoke, followed by a hot, spicy cinnamon finish. It’s pretty decent, but the palate doesn’t quite match up to the promise of the nose. £37",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
83,"Koval Single Barrel Rye (Barrel 1,326)",40.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Certified organic, distilled from 100% rye. First whiff: like that smell when you tear apart anti-theft plastic packaging. Swirl and warm to get unseeded rye bread, old books, bitter grass. Palate is quite right: sweet grain and a bit of mint balanced by bitter rye oils and wood, slipping into a sweet but wood-framed finish. Pleasantly youthful whiskey in the mouth; nose is sharp still.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
83,Breakout Rye 8 year old,43.0,Rye Whiskey,30,"In the pantheon of rye whiskey, Breakout sits at a coveted 8 years old. The nose offers its age with a hint of oak over the delicate, savory herbal aromas that range from dill to oregano. There’s a slight vanilla note on the second whiff. The palate offers smoke, coffee, smoked paprika, vanilla wafers, and a hint of chocolate, followed by a medium-length finish, making me wish this was just 10 proof points higher. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
83,Highwood Canadian Rye,40.0,Canadian,17,"Sweet candy nose and a sour rye palate. Tropical fruit and orange zest, with sweet golden sultanas, sour apricot strudel, and Jujubes on the nose follow through to the palate, where they are joined by oak caramel, vanilla, and dusty grain. Peppery spices linger throughout. Wraps up with clean grain, pepper, and sweetish fruits.<em> (Canada only) $23 CAD</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
83,Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 25 year old 1990,,Single Grain Whisky,126,"This refill barrel is perhaps more suited to those well versed in drinking grains regularly. The nose is herbal, with tarragon, endive leaves, and artichoke hearts, though there is balance from oat biscuits and honey. The palate begins clean and pure, builds complexity with vegetal notes and honey sweetness before delivering flavors of dates, nougat, wheat crackers, and dry, toasted spices. The drying finish has Quaker oats and sizzling spices. An acquired taste, this one, but not without merit. (162 bottles) £87",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
83,Teerenpeli 10 year old,43.0,Single Malt Finnish Whisky,112,"Bourbon and sherry cask maturation were used for this bottling, which marks a milestone for the Finnish distillers. This has a nose of fresh cut apple, scrunched orange peel, malt, lime zest, and digestive biscuits drizzled with sesame oil. Lemon sherbet, cremola foam, and custard Danish start in a sweet direction, though it speedily converges prismatically to a trio of flavors comprising spearmint gum, menthol, and clove. Water only enhances the menthol. A cool, minty finish with residual sweet juices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
83,Balblair 2004 Bourbon Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,74,"The Bourbon Matured variant of Balblair’s two Travel Retail expressions of its 2004 vintage is available on a worldwide basis. Light and delicate on the initial nose, with ripe pear, melon, lemon, watery toffee, and hints of honey and ginger. Sweet orchard fruits on the palate, with developing cinnamon, coconut, and crème brûlée. Tingling spices in the finish, with slightly drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
83,Glenlivet Nadurra Islay Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,89,"The aim here was to recreate the style of malt made by George Smith, but rather than running peated malt, Chivas Bros. has aged the spirit in Islay casks (not what George would have done). On the upside, this is a classic Nadurra: estery fruits with pineapple to the fore, freesia, pear, and fresh apple, the smoke giving subtle gun-flint notes to the palate. I like it as a dram, but it’s wimped out of what was intended. Marked accordingly.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
83,Amrut Naarangi,50.0,Indian Whisky,114,"Amrut ingeniously flavored an <em>oloroso</em> cask with wine and orange peel for 3 years before finishing this highly innovative whisky in it. A warmth and richness exudes, the citrus intensity of peel and orange oils develops the longer you resist temptation. Dried fruits, apricot, heather, ripe mango, triple sec, with a slight mustiness. Syrupy, soft orange pulp with zested limes makes it quite nippy. Finish of gum and wood notes after a spicy start. Whatever you do, drink it neat. (Europe, Canada, and Asia; 900 bottles) £75",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
83,Royal Lochnagar Distillers Edition 2000 (batch #RL/96-8S),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,78,"This 2012 limited edition from the Deeside distillery of Royal Lochnagar underwent initial maturation in bourbon barrels before a period of finishing in muscat wine casks. The pleasing nose offers pears poached in dessert wine, heather, malt, and ginger. Rich and rounded on the palate, with immediate soft, ripe peaches, then figs, ginger, and cloves. Lengthy in the slightly nutty finish, with fruity spice notes.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
83,Speyburn Arranta,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,61,"Poor old Speyburn. An unfairly overlooked malt simply because of its (too low) price. The use of more active casks here gives an almost waxed crayon nose, along with some sweet depth. In time, there are fresh green fruits, raspberry mousse, and beautiful floral intensity. Water produces lemon. The palate is clean and quite light, but there’s a pool of fruits in the center giving a focal point. As water makes things (lemon) soapy, I’d have it neat. £40",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
83,Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 21 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"One year older than last year’s 20 year old release, (which I felt was on the precipice of being over-oaked) and the extra year is evident. On the nose, the whiskey is nicely balanced. The palate tells a different story, with soft vanilla, honey, caramel, dried fruit, and cinnamon segueing into dominant leather, tobacco, and resinous oak on a long, dry finish. I fear bottling this whiskey annually, one year older, is going in the wrong direction.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
83,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 25 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,348,"A stunningly lovely nose: all sweet, rounded, and layered with exotic tropical fruits, scented woods, wax, and perfume. Water makes it oilier and more waxy in nature. Sadly though, the oak has taken charge on the palate, making it more grippy and nutty. Worth a long sniff though! £228",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
83,The Deveron 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,61,"John Dewar &amp; Sons Ltd has released a 12 year old bottling from its Macduff distillery, formerly marketed as Glen Deveron, but now simply known as the Deveron. Soft, sweet, and fruity on the nose, with vanilla, ginger, ripe peaches, and apple blossom. Medium-bodied, gently spicy, with butterscotch and Brazil nuts before a hint of licorice kicks in. Quite dry spicy oak in the finish, with a contrasting note of caramel. £40",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
83,Usquaebach Old Rare Stone Flagon,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,115,"Hunter Laing blended this grand Highland whisky: an 85% malt-driven recipe of more mature stock. I liked its aromas of dripping caramels, dry peats, soft hay, and faint pepper balancing the resilient smoky character. There’s the juiciness of mandarin oranges, too. The blend is smooth and well-textured, beginning with sugared orange, malt, vanilla, and toasted spices which glide into clove and black pepper. The drying finish has spicy pepper, ground ginger, and lasting citrus.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
83,Spirit of America Bourbon,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"More MGP whiskey: 2 years old, 51% corn, 45% wheat, 5% malt. That’s a lot of wheat, and you can smell it: soft, sweet, even a bit doughy, with a little mint candy. Extremely smooth, but not insipid; there’s some nice oak backbone here, a good weight, and a solid center of corn. Craftsmanlike. And $1 from every bottle goes to veterans programs. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
83,Pemberton Valley Organic Single Malt,44.0,Canadian,68,"Micro-distiller Tyler Schramm studied distilling at Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University. Clearly he learned not to release whisky until it is mature. A waxy, grassy nose delights with dry grain, fresh-cut hay, red fruits, and cinnamon hearts. The palate, though less complex shows wheelbarrow loads of sweet fruits, soft spices, earthy notes, and bracing heat. Green grasses, pink clover, and hints of black licorice precede a long, peppery, grassy, floral finish. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$90",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
83,Vicomte,40.0,Single Malt French Whisky,55,"A noble French single malt whisky from the Cognac region, pronounced ‘Veecont’ (Viscount). The barley is 100% organic, and the whisky makes the best use of French Limousin oak cognac barrel maturation for 8 years, with luscious results. The nose resounds with poached pear, overripe apricot, peach cordial, orange peel, toasted spices, crème brûlée, and fruit syrups. A satin smooth drinking experience shows sweet, burnt sugars, fruit cordials, and roasted lime slices. The finish is a ripe harvest of apricots. £36",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
83,Glen Breton Rare 10 year old,43.0,Canadian,83,"It is unfortunate that Glenora does not mark lot numbers, as each succeeding batch improves over previous ones. Gone are the soapy notes that oozed out of the bottle, keeping early releases from showing their strength. While the nose is big, on the palate the whisky becomes light, with brisk spiciness, some malt, and subtle oak. Glen Breton is known for its red apple notes and gentle flowers. To these now add pepper, honey, caramel, and light oak.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
83,Arran Machrie Moor 5th Edition,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,62,"Arran distillery has been making peated batches of spirit since 2004, and this NAS bottling is the fifth release of that spirit, peated to 20 ppm. The outturn is 12,000 bottles. Nutty peat, spicy malt, toffee, and lemon on the mildly savory nose. Vibrant on the palate, with lots of citrus fruit. A bonfire smokiness develops steadily, with spice, nuts, and plain chocolate through to the relatively long finish, which features a persistent citric note.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
83,Glenturret Sherry Edition,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"Principally matured in bourbon casks, this expression has undergone a finishing period in sherry casks. Sweet wood polish on the nose, with brief pineapple juice notes and rosehip syrup. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with vanilla, spicy milk chocolate, sultanas, and some earthiness. The finish is medium in length, with sherry and a tang of bitter orange. £47",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
83,Highland Park Ambassador&#039;s Choice 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Originally exclusive to the Swedish market, this expression was selected by Highland Park’s Danish brand ambassador Martin Markvardsen. Matured in a combination of 70% bourbon barrels and 30% <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. Waxy and malty on the early nose, with fresh earth, damp moss, vanilla, and honey. Gentle peat on the palate, more earthy notes; herbal, with lime and salt. The finish is quite short, showing apricots, slight peatiness, allspice.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
83,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Longmorn) 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,190,"Oak-driven, with cream and butterscotch dominating the nose initially. Then there’s black cherry, and coriander seed frying in butter. The weighty distillate adds depth, but not specific flavors. The palate is all coconut cream, cream toffee, then Longmorn’s cooked plum density comes in. I’d have preferred the oak to be scaled back, allowing the distillate to show, but if you’re looking for a scotch made for bourbon lovers, then go no further.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
83,High West Silver OMG Pure Rye,,Craft Whiskey,36,"It seemed a good idea to revisit OMG after High West had four years’ experience under their belt. The wet grain and green apple are still there, with the bitter fringe of rye crisping things nicely. Pure rye High West spirit, no oak, and you see where this may go. A smooth, almost creamy entry—smooth for the proof—and the rye takes over, though grainy sweetness refuses to quit. More polished now. Hope there’s plenty in wood.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
83,Mackmyra Svensk Ek,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,64,"Named after the 10% of the recipe that benefits from Swedish oak maturation, this light-colored dram has honey-drenched crumpets, creamed butter, green tea taken in lemon groves, and hints of peppermint. Shredded lemon and lime peels are joined by a precise, concentrated wood spice note with ground ginger and black pepper. Dilution fattens the mouthfeel but flattens the citrus peel, leaving a smudge of light toffee and malt. Pleasant sipping for those long, Swedish summer days. €59",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
83,Canadian Club Sherry Cask (batch C12-224),,Canadian,25,"Hard to find Harvey’s Bristol Cream sherry casks are the secret of this big fruity whisky, and also the reason it varies among batches. Rumors that Sherry Cask will be discontinued in the U.S. are true, so stock up now. Otherwise, be prepared for some cross-border shopping in Canada, where it will continue to be available. The sweet sherry influence is obvious in ripe dark currants, golden raisins, and dates. A Brio-like nuttiness gives way to hot pepper.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
83,The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 26 year old 1988,,Single Grain Whisky,142,"A light golden dram from a refill hoggie, redolent of fragrant honey, custard slices, orange water, perfumed soaps, and fresh spring blossom. Vanilla, dried peel, and shortbread petticoat tails on the palate, that develops with spun sugar flavors. The whole concoction is anchored by a little oak, but the cask has been gentle. The finish is mouth-drawing, but settles down like a well-sucked butterscotch. Mellow and serene. (<em>305 bottles</em>) £91",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
83,Grand Macnish Six Cask Edition,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,37,"Playing on regional styles, this blends six single malts representative of the Speyside, Islay, Lowland, Campbeltown, Islands, and Highland whisky regions. Sun-dried peats greet the nose with aromas of stewed apples, flaky pastries, apricot conserve, vanilla, and cinnamon. Creamy vanilla and coconut flavors develop, with a slow-burn spiciness crackling in the center of the tongue. Seville orange and caramel cookie flavors escort a long finish of dry, tingling spices, though it could use a little more heft in the mouthfeel.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
83,Celtic Cask Aon Déag 11,46.0,Irish,136,"A 14 year old unpeated single malt whiskey given The Celtic Whiskey Shop’s trademark Ànima Negra red wine finish for 3 years. The nose has whiffs of fruit gums and honey-drizzled baked plums. A well-defined fruity attack on the palate of strawberry bubblegum and orange peel sucks in the cheeks, but collides with spices, maltiness, and gentle caramels. A spicy burst ushers in cola flavors for a lengthy finish, with a touch of mint showing up late for the party. €125",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
83,Blade and Bow,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"This whiskey is produced utilizing a solera system, similar to the way sherry is aged, and is said to contain some whiskey distilled at Stitzel-Weller. Thick and viscous in texture. Orchard fruit (orange, apricot, pear) on the front of the palate, segueing to honeyed vanilla, dried pit fruits, and dried spice (evergreen, cinnamon), leading to a warm finish. Intriguing, but lacking polish to garner a higher rating.",John Hansell,Fall 2015
83,Chattanooga 1816 Reserve,45.0,Miscellaneous,30,"Shy nose: some cornbread and spicy candy. Whooshes into the mouth, though, with a lively sweet and spicy rush followed by herbal notes: woodruff, fresh marjoram, meadow grass. The finish becomes drier, finally showing a bit of oak, then drying to a powdery, medicinal astringency. Almost more like a tonic than a whiskey. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
83,Tomatin Cask Strength Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,73,"This is Tomatin’s first cask strength offering, and is also non-chill filtered. The initial batch of 15,000 bottles was released in February, and was matured in a mix of <em>oloroso</em> and bourbon casks. The nose showcases ginger, malt, Jaffa oranges, almonds, and melon, while the pleasingly viscous palate offers caramel, vanilla, warm leather, and chocolate-coated lime creams. Long and gently spicy in the drying finish. <em>(Worldwide except U.S.) </em>£50",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
83,Wemyss Malts Kirsch Gateau (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1988,56.0,Single Malt Scotch,190,"Polished rosewood. Big sherried notes, but also generous sweetness. Vermouth-like: dark fruits, a hint of spice, light oxidation, with some herbal edges and Morello cherries. Becomes balsamic. The palate is highly concentrated, with more cherry, but has this intense savory astringency. Water is needed. The nose continues to be remarkable, all damask rose and resin, but dilution can’t eradicate the mouth-puckering quality. £130",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
83,Douglas Laing Provenanace (distilled at Longmorn) 11 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"Pale straw. Light but intense, with some pollen, dusty fruits, baked apple. Water brings out an aroma like a fruit orchard in springtime. Performs much better in the mouth, and although hot, shows good distillery character with some cooked peach, quince jam, and yellow plums. A decent lunchtime dram. £50",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
83,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Tomatin) 10 year old 2004 (cask #2645),,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Matured solely in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a light, fruit-forward nose with nectarine, honey, malt, and a touch of spice. The entry is softer than you’d expect for the proof and it presents the fruit at the nose, along with salt and a dash of black pepper. The spice takes over in the mid-palate along with some heat, really throwing off the balance established in the entry. A light finish closes out a slightly disjointed taste experience. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
83,Macduff 16 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"This single cask from Macduff distillery was distilled in 1997 and is offered non-chill filtered and with natural color. Melons, lemon, a hint of ozone, and a suggestion of warm steel on the nose. The palate is supple and fruity, with ginger, white pepper, and developing vanilla notes. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with citrus fruits. <em>(Exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) </em>£50",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
83,The Lost Distillery Company Stratheden (batch 2/2),46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,65,"Slabs of plain chocolate, Kendal mint cake, vanilla essence, and malt with a dry, dusty character makes this suggest itself for an after-dinner occasion. The palate is very sweet; sugarplum, caramelized brown sugar, flapjacks, bramble, and pink rhubarb before it finally coagulates into a thick Horlicks maltiness. There’s an impressive trajectory of flavor here, though the mouthfeel is nothing special and dilution doesn’t enhance it to any real degree. Dry and malty finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
83,I.W. Harper,41.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"The base bottling of the “new” I.W. Harper from Diageo. Source is “new” Bernheim; no age given. Nose is simple: hard candy and corn. A fairly simple and somewhat thin mouth as well: sweet, with hints of ripe melon and apple, and an edge of oak dryness. Finishes well, with a cleanly sweet spiciness. Table bourbon, though a bit pricey for that.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
83,Craigdarroch,50.0,Canadian,79,"This odd bird illustrates the yin-yang plight of the craft distiller. Pablum, sweet mash, grain dust, dry green hay, and linseed oil imbued with melon bespeak a telltale immature nose, while the palate, rich in grapes, peaches, and exotic tropical fruits, laced with hot cinnamon, allspice, and pepper, denotes maturity. Blue clay, creamy barley sugar, and a soft waxiness temper gently-pulling oak tannins, while inklings of green apple peels round out a sizzling palate. <em>(Victoria Spirits distillery only) </em>C$100",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
83,BenRiach 35 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,690,"A venerable bottling from its proprietor, and there’s no doubt from the nose that you’re dealing with an ultra-mature whisky. Like going in to meet your aged grandfather who is sitting in his library surrounded by old books, with a little sunlight filtering through the drapes. In time, there’s dried peach and envelope gum. The palate is wooded and concentrated, but it is dry and lacking in the required energy. Water stirs it into life, but kills the flavor. £450",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
83,Glen Garioch Wine Cask Matured 1998,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,155,"A 15 year old Glen Garioch which is unique as the first from the distillery to be fully matured in French Bordeaux wine casks. The casks in question are <em>tonneaux de vin rouge</em> from Saint-Julien, and distillation took place on June 23, 1998. Just 450 cases are available globally. Sweet berries on the early nose, with milk chocolate, ginger, and spicy oak. Malt, ginger, plums, and honey on the rich palate, while the long finish offers spicy malt and honey.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
83,Wemyss Malts Bench with a Sea View (distilled at Clynelish) 1997,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,104,"Unusually, Wemyss Malts simultaneously offered two single cask bottlings of Clynelish in October 2014, both distilled in 1997 and matured in hogsheads. ‘Bench with a Sea View’ provided an out-turn of 371 bottles. The nose is sweet and fruity, with green apples and chocolate mousse. Slightly oily on the palate, with black pepper, salt, and orchard fruits. Persistently peppery in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, a hint of brine, and cocoa. £68",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
83,Wemyss Malts Vintage Strawberry Punnet (distilled at Invergordon) 1988,46.0,Grain Scotch Whisky,125,"I’m playfully perplexed as to whether the titular “vintage” refers to an elderly strawberry or an aged punnet. Undaunted, this example from the Highland powerhouse noses much better than promised with fresh mint, small, tight strawberry buds, sandy loam, and a saccharine sweetness. It has a sweet, syrupy, fat flavor, in turn revealing caramel, buttery notes, white chocolate, vanilla, and black currant. A satisfying finish of browning butter and warm chestnuts. (242 bottles) £82",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
83,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bowmore) 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,168,"The first thing to note is the strength. It’s surprisingly not that hot initially, rather there are hints of soft orchard fruits, gentle smoke, and seashells. With water, the fruits show up—mango and peach—but the alcohol is still masking things. Water goes in immediately to produce a palate that is cool, slightly sweet, with seashore notes, wet stones, and those fruits, but there’s still a real tension to the whole experience. For the brave. £110",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
83,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Dalmore) 1997,,Single Malt Scotch,119,"This 17 year old refill hogshead-matured expression of Dalmore was distilled in May 1997, and 237 bottles have been released. It is an interesting example of Dalmore uncut, without the proprietary sherry maturation-spin usually put on it. The nose is sweet, with caramel, tinned peaches and pineapple, and a smearing of honey. Zesty spices open the palate, which becomes nutty, with Jaffa oranges, gingery oak, and dark chocolate. Long and warming in the finish, with more oak and plain chocolate. £78",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
83,"Glenkeir Treasures (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory) 9 year old",40.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"Distilled in February 2005. Earthy peat, brine, vanilla, cereal, and a hint of cinnamon on the confident nose. Finally, wood smoke. Lively in the mouth, with nutty spices and pipe tobacco, while peat briefly takes a back seat before reasserting itself. Ginger and peat embers in the medium-length finish. <em>(Whisky Shop only) </em>£35/500 ml",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
83,Congenial Spirits Twelve Five Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"The nose features strong rye spice accompanied by sharp, young oak along with black pepper, graphite, and a touch of green apple. The entry is much heavier and sweeter than you’d expect from such a young whiskey. Things quickly change in the mid-palate with a spice blast of cinnamon, black pepper, rye, and oak. A solid dash of heat gives the mid-palate some kick and drives a short, dry finish. Some nice ideas hampered by the reality of youth.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
83,Westland American Single Malt,40.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"A non-age stated single malt from Washington State. Light amber in color, there’s more oak on the nose than you’d expect, along with baked apple, chocolate, cinnamon, and clove. Chocolate leads the entry, followed by clove, cinnamon, baked apple, and salt. A spicy mid-palate picks up some ginger and a dash of heat. The finish is fairly short and dry. This feels a bit young and lacks depth. An interesting start; let&#039;s see where it goes from here.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
83,Tap 8 Rye Sherry Finished,,Canadian,47,"Heavy caramel, hints of pansies, dustiness, warming spices, gentle pepper, and bushels of fruit. The <em>amontillado</em> sherry finish gives a tannic red wine feel without much wineyness. About that finish: rather than “rejuvenating” barrels by pouring in sherry and swishing it around before adding the whisky, sherry was blended directly with mature 8 year old Canadian rye, which then spent two months in American oak barrels. Whisky purists may recoil, but the result is very tasty dram. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
83,The English Whisky Co. Chapter 15 Limited Edition,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,69,"Here, talented distiller David Fitt shows us his latest expression of heavily peated whisky. The nose has jalapeño and bell peppers, with pungent peat smoke that catches at the back of the throat. The smoke is sooty coal dust buoyed with some sweetness, but without a medicinal edge to the phenols. Sipping brought lemon bonbons, herbal elements, and some burnt toast character. It swells out in the middle before relenting, leaving a quenching, sweet finish and a smoky aura. £45",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
83,Auchentoshan American Oak,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"American Oak is new to the Auchentoshan core range in 2014 and is the first release from this Lowland distillery to be matured solely in first-fill bourbon casks. An initial note of rosewater, then Madeira, vanilla, developing musky peaches, and icing sugar. Spicy fresh fruit on the palate, chili notes, and more Madeira and vanilla. The finish is medium in length, and spicy to the end.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
83,Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Typically pale and slightly broader than in previous years, with a little more fleshiness that rubs alongside squid ink and white pepper. Huge smoke mingles with the sharp tang of brine and a touch of bran. Water brings out lanolin. There’s little oak getting in the way of the distillery character here and while water settles the waves, it just doesn’t have the extra dimension that elevates the decent to the great. It does make a great highball tho’. (31,428 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
83,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1991 Oysters with Lemon Pearls,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,154,"Light gold with a very fresh and slightly ozonic nose that brings to mind Thai herbs: lemongrass, galangal, as well as lime. Just slightly nippy when neat. The palate is equally intense, but with a central sweetness. Water cuts down this razor-sharp intensity, adding a softer mid-palate texture, while the finish remains slightly mineraly. A decent <em>aperitif</em> Bunna. £97",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
83,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1991 Thread of Smoke,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,164,"Yes, it’s another 1991 Bunna from Wemyss, so check the name when purchasing. This one has a distinctly smoky element alongside the marine note which they both share. Very light lemon, with water, then a hit that’s like walking into a high-class sushi joint. A zesty start with lots of angelica, and then sweetness with, when diluted, soft malt and light ginger on the palate. Rock solid. £103",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
83,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Loch Lomond) Batch 1,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"Rose petals, pomegranate, toasted coriander seeds, and glacé cherry mix it up with a tangle of Bramley apple peelings. A medium weight grain whisky with a satiny texture. Huge, throbbing, pulsating ginger kicks in at full strength. Yowser! Water knocks the fiery ginger out, but quells this Loch Lomond to a duller spice profile. A finish of ground almond, subdued gingerbread, and active spices. Great nose, but I was hoping for greater versatility of flavor. £38",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
83,Exclusive Malts 2005 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory),,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Bottled at 8 years of age as part of Exclusive Malts’ U.S. Batch 5, this is a relatively youthful expression of the peated Ledaig spirit produced at Tobermory distillery. The nose is full-on and vibrant, with seaweed, brine, peat, black pepper, and new leather. The palate opens with a big punch of spicy peat, then sweet cereal notes and more black pepper. Hot smoke and spice in the medium-length finish, with a hint of coal.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
83,Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice 1998 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory),43.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Matured in refill, remade American hogsheads, this 1998 bottling from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull is of the peated Ledaig variant. The nose offers dry peat, brown wrapping paper, fish oil, and wood preservative. Oily on the palate, with bitter orange, sweet peat, ginger, and black pepper, plus fabric band-aids. Lingering pepper and Germolene in the ashy finish. £45",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
83,Wigle Small Cask Series Rye,42.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Strong, bold aromas of rye grain, fruit (raspberries, black grapes), and dry cinnamon. Punchy rye on the tongue, starts 42% tame but quickly catches fire, roaring toward a barnburner of a finish. As the fire dies down, you find cocoa and rye oil in the embers. This young (12 month) rye is small-barrel shouty, but the roots are good. Solid effort.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
83,Celtic Cask Trí,46.0,Irish,112,"First impression is of molten Reese’s peanut butter cups. This 13 year old single grain whiskey has been finished in second-fill red wine casks from Ànima Negra in Mallorca, however this wine cask has given the whiskey a kick in the Balearics. The grain character takes a drubbing, the nose engulfed by jam pots and loganberry. It is gentle and deliciously fruity, reminiscent of strawberry, raspberry pop tarts, and citrus groves. Black pepper and caramelized sugar to close. (417 bottles) €90",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
83,Grant&#039;s Voyager,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,32,"Molten blossom honey, almond milk puddings, and Parma violets interlaced with a fine, drifting chimney smoke compose the nose of this new blend from William Grant &amp; Sons<em>.</em> Smooth, burnished orange and honey cough drops initially, then the flavor develops through more pronounced citrus and gentle spices to achieve a sweeter climax. The grain is quite evident in the harmony of the blend. The finish is long, more beeswax than honey, the sweetness finally depleted. <em>(Travel Retail only) </em>£20",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
83,Bn6 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bunnahabhain),,Single Malt Scotch,84,"Very chewy. Think of melting Mars bars, with a touch of coconut cream, then red-fruit acidity, red cherry, and lemon. All very forward and sweet, but with no alcohol when neat, showing an active cask. Dilute, there’s coconut, pea shoots, and banoffie pie. The palate is thick with Jaffa cake (orange and chocolate), then nutty granola. It doesn’t take water too well. Quite fat. £50/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
83,Exclusive Malts 1991 (distilled at Glencadam),,Single Malt Scotch,160,"A 22 year old Glencadam; maturation took place in a refill American oak hogshead. The nose offers rich honey and malt notes, though slightly balsamic. Syrup-like on the palate, heathery and spicy, with more honey. Relatively long and spicy in the finish, with chili, though honey persists right to the end. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
83,Kirkland Signature (distilled at Glenlivet) 40 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,700,"Bottling of a large package of 12 butts and 30 hoggies dating from 1972. The nose is slightly closed initially, but shows good mature distillery character: old apple, potpourri, more raspberry, and furniture polish. The palate is a little dry, with humidor and light chocolate, but needs water to bring out the fruit-sugar sweetness. It’s good, but that low bottling strength has sapped it of the energy which is vital for old whiskies. <em>(U.S. only) </em>",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
83,Master of Malt Darkness! Macallan 15 year old PX Cask-Finished,,Single Malt Scotch,185,"The Darkness! series involves finishing in specially-made octave (50-liter) casks. This has positive Macallan character with some oil (putty even) and touches of malt and turned earth, but also a scented, cognac-like fruitiness with added spice. Water adds a little sherried cheesiness. The palate shows some nutty, oxidized flavors to begin with, but then in the middle the PX flumps onto the tongue, slowing and dampening the drive. Pleasant enough though. £110/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
83,Kilchoman 100% Islay 4th Edition,59.0,Single Malt Scotch,108,"A distillate of Islay-grown barley, made in 2009-10 and aged in bourbon wood. Here’s an intense Kilchoman with a licorice root sweetness mixed with dried seaweed, <em>machair</em> (beach pasture), cereal, and herbal smoke. The palate is slightly oily and hot when neat, with a distinct mineral edge. Water shows its youth but also allows tarragon and wormwood to develop. £64",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
83,Jim Beam Signature Craft Quarter Cask Finished,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Gently sweet vanilla, corn, and honey on the nose, with background spice and dried citrus. The same sweet notes show on the first half of the palate, with resinous oak, polished leather, and dried spice on the back end; the quarter cask aging is evident. Unfortunately, the sweet flavors and dried oak influence don’t marry very well, with too much sweetness and youthfulness up front, and too much oak bringing up the rear.",John Hansell,Fall 2014
83,Master of Malt Single Cask Series (distilled at North British) 18 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,100,"A tasty example from the historic North British distillery in Edinburgh, with a bouquet of vanilla, sweet hay, and mint ice cream. A sip made me nostalgic for childhood candies such as sherbet-filled, fizzy flying saucers and prohibited ivory-white candy sticks. I was seized by the initial lemon zing of acidic tartness, which becomes creamier before a richer, candied peel taste appears. There’s a clean, sweet finish and the mint pops up with water. Overall, satisfying but uncomplicated.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
83,Telsington VI Single Cask 5 year old,,Liechtenstein,92,"A sweet nose of barley sugar, Refreshers candy, ground cumin, mown grass, and a trace of salt emerge from this triple distilled malt matured in pinot noir and Swiss oak casks. It’s another robust dram from the Principality, though after a burst of maltiness, it remains a linear experience of spun sugar, toffee apples, crème brûlée, and pomegranate. Water slackens the mouthfeel to reveal soft lemons, but this latest release works really well neat. €69",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
83,Exclusive Malts Speyside 10 year old 2003 Cask #1781,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"From an undisclosed Speyside distillery. The nose is extraordinarily yeasty, with distinct apple cider backed by light caramel. The palate is more integrated than the nose with oak and cinnamon spice, apple, honey, and malt. At first these flavors are well balanced, but a spice and heat blast in the mid-palate throws things off. The finish reflects this and is quite dry. The parts are better than the whole in an interesting and strong whisky.  (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
83,Kirkland Signature Highland 18 year old Sherry Cask Finish,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,33,"An 18 year old single malt for just $33 should set alarm bells ringing. But this sherry-finished Kirkland expression from an undisclosed distillery is definitely a decent dram at a bargain-basement price. Initially slightly vegetal and earthy on the nose, developing a warm leatheriness, with sherry, figs, melon skin, and caramel. Silky on the palate, with milk chocolate, emerging hazelnuts, sweet sherry, and honey. The finish is medium in length, with spicy orange and mocha coffee notes.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
83,Lord Elcho 15 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,44,"The eldest son of the 5<sup>th</sup> earl of Wemyss, Lord Elcho was supportive to the Young Pretender. Proportionally, more sherry at play here. Plum skin, chunky raisins, blackcurrant, and fainter sweetened cocoa and coffee bean notes. The palate is a little hollow at first, then proffers barley sugar, rich shortbread, baked apple, linseed, and toffee, though the flavor development plateaus. Water picks out sweet clementine notes. Given the choice of expressions, I prefer the vibrancy of the Young(er) Pretender. £26",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
83,Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,15,"Sharp nose, a bit of heat, fresh ground/cracked spices—cinnamon, pepper, allspice—and hot sugar about to caramelize. There’s nothing soft here. The first crash on the tongue isn’t soft either; it’s rushing bonded heat, insistent pepper, and dry oak. Wait a bit, and it calms as you finally find the corn and the mouth widens, then slides into a dryer, lasting finish. Pretty wild ride for a wheated bourbon.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
83,66Gilead The Wild Oak,47.0,Canadian,69,"From a bourbon-style mashbill matured in new Missouri oak, this first whisky from 66 Gilead salutes Wild Oak farm, where contented cattle dine on the distillery’s spent grains. Dry grain, gray weathered wood, sea breezes, caramel, and soft, earthy, woody notes become vanilla, saltwater taffy, cherries, and fruit punch, with herbal hints of celery. It’s hot and spicy with sizzling pepper and searing ginger over a barrelhouse woodiness. Young, but not rough, with a long, peppery finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2014
83,John Myer Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Organic rye, all grown on the Myer farm in the Finger Lakes by John Myer himself. 100% rye, converted with enzymes; the Myers do everything in-house. Nose is bent with rye oiliness and a faint peppermint brightness. In the mouth it’s rye bitterness all the way through, a crisp, fresh-chewed mint in a mouthful of sweet grassiness, and then a very quick finish: wham, bam, and gone. Simple and clean; could add depth and polish.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
83,Stalk and Barrel Cask 8,46.0,Canadian,64,"Distilled from a mash of malted two-row Canadian barley, and matured indoors for exactly 1,221 days in a first-fill bourbon barrel, Cask 8 is glowingly warm with soaring notes of acetone and sweet esters on a base redolent of linseed oil, gunnysacks, and grassy cereals. The palate is sweetish, like gummy bears, and very spicy. Pepper, ginger, and hot cinnamon bathe in a weighty, creamy body. A longish finish shows soft, oaky barrel notes. (<em>Distillery only) </em>C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
83,Tweeddale 14 year old Batch 4,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,76,"This batch of 1,420 bottles was created with slightly older malts, a 16 year old grain from a refill hogshead and a 14 year old Lowland malt disgorged from an Islay cask. Sugar mice, dried hay, sharpened pencils, hints of lemon, with subtle smoke like the burning of a distant stubble field. Sweet cereal notes, black pepper, and ginger parkin build to a conclusion of Brazil nut, mocha, and chocolate ganache. <i>(UK &amp; Netherlands only) £45</i>",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
83,Thistle Finch Rye,40.0,Craft Whiskey,32,"New distillery in Lancaster, Penn. “Locally sourced” grain, copper pot still, unaged. Rich new-make smell, warm, full grain, rye oil, and anise. Light spirit: sweet, more grain and a character like pizzelles; sweet crisp anise cookies. Easily enjoyed, with a finish of more sweet grain and anise. Interestingly schnapps-like, given the area’s German roots.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
83,Sapling Vermont Maple Rye Whiskey,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,40,"Located in the heart of Vermont’s syrup belt, Saxtons River distillery makes both a Vermont maple-flavored rye and a maple-flavored bourbon whiskey. The rye is the better of the two and does a solid job of mixing oak, cinnamon, black pepper, and rye spice notes with vanilla and rich maple syrup. The rye whiskey is a little young, but the maple syrup complements it well and is more companion than cover.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
83,Black Bottle,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"In terms of bang for your buck this has always been one of the very best blends, punching well above its weight. Whether you feel the same about this revamped version depends on how much you want a peat punch. Previously rough and gutsy, this is softer, with more licorice and treacle but also more younger sappiness. Smoke has the last say but it&#039;s like an aging sportsman, replacing energy and attitude with guile and subtlety.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
83,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Straight Malt,,Single Malt American Whiskey,100,"Much darker in color than the Classic bottling (also reviewed this issue), as is expected. The nose warns of a wood-whelmed whiskey: dark, bitter wood notes, with a caramel underlay. The mouth is much hotter than the Classic bottling, with bold oak spice in the front and a gooey caramel/toffee sweetness underneath…only it’s not as good as that sounds. It’s all rather one-dimensional, including the hot oak finish. An interesting lesson in wood, but not at $200 for the pair.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
83,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Longmorn) 1990,,Single Malt Scotch,121,"Longmorn is one of Speyside’s fruit bombs, something which remains true here, even if in slightly paler guise than usual. Instead of ripe autumn fruits, here you get kiwi, William pear, green plum, even green tomato, and a faint blossom reminiscent of the almond notes of <i>sakura</i> (cherry blossom). I’d keep water well away, such is this light, lacy Longmorn’s fragility. £73",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
83,Canadian 83,40.0,Canadian,22,"After Crown Royal is bottled the barrels are refilled with new whisky spirit, to spend three more years in silent slumber. “Crown washes out the woodiness and leaves the velvet behind,” one distillery worker enthuses. “We probably drink more of this in Gimli than the rest of the country combined.” The steely dusty rye, charcoal tinges, blistering white pepper, creamy butterscotch pudding, and candied ginger of Canadian 83 are the restrained, confident declaration of hard-bit whisky makers. C$24",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
83,Last Mountain Private Reserve,45.0,Canadian,45,"Distiller Colin Schmidt is earning his blending chops honestly, using sourced whiskies to keep the cash flow positive while his own distillate matures. Sweet burned wood underpins rich dried fruit, hints of crisp oak, butterscotch pudding, and sour gooseberries. Hot pepper and cinnamon enliven a syrupy mouthfeel as the palate broadens into warm, clean earth and dry, weathered barn board. A long, lingering burn finishes in tingling ginger ale and candied citrus peel. <i>(Distillery only)</i> C$50",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
83,Watkins Select,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"Nose of sweet cinnamon candy, wintergreen, and wet wood. Wintergreen and hot/sweet cinnamon carry through on the palate, with light vanilla and some pleasant oak around the edges. Happy shiny whiskey, but you realize what’s missing when you get to the finish…and there isn’t one. Incredibly quick on the finish, and pretty simple throughout. It’s like summer love: fun, but shallow and over quickly. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
83,Stauning Traditional 2nd Edition,55.0,Danish,128,"Denmark often seems to live in the shadow of Sweden, and certainly that has been the case with whisky. But slowly and surely a revolution is happening there, and I suspect that Stauning will be right at the forefront of it. This is another work in progress: pleasant, well made, and potentially very good indeed. The dominant flavors are gooseberry, sour apple, and pepper. Good as an aperitif. 695 Krone/500 ml",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
83,Copper House Single Malt No. 1,43.0,Single Malt English Whisky,73,"Adnams brewery is known for two things in particular: a fearless approach to bold flavors and its investment in quality. Its other spirits are award winners, but it&#039;s going to have to wait a little longer to repeat the trick with its single malt. This is just 3 years old and while it’s extremely well made and the maturation in virgin French oak ensures tastiness, spice, and sweet soft vanilla, it hasn&#039;t fully realized its potential. £44",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
83,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glen Grant) 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"As this is slightly closed when neat, you have to search for Glen Grant’s classic apple notes behind a tense nose which, even with water, remains inward-looking. Thankfully, this changes on the tongue with pure, very linear (typical of GG) flavors of cool mint, cucumber, basil, and yes, apple. Easy-going from a relaxed cask, but with more substance than you’d expect.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
83,Glencadam The Rather Enriched Oloroso Finish 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"<i>Oloroso</i> Finish has spent 16 months gaining additional maturation in <i>oloroso</i> casks. The use of sherry wood has lent the nose a greater sweetness, with vanilla, dates, apples, and cinnamon. Floral, spicy notes, with toffee, ginger, and sweet sherry on the palate, giving extra body and resonance. The fruity finish is of medium length, with mixed spices and white pepper. £45",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
83,The Macallan Coronation (American Oak Cask #190950),,Single Malt Scotch,567,"Bottled at 350ml. as a pair with a Spanish oak version (and probably sold out at source), here you get the merest glimpse of Macallan’s meatiness (shepherd’s pie) before flowers and apple blossom take charge. Lifted, yes, but never delicate. Water brings out cereal and mealy pudding, with barley sugar on the end. £350",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
83,The Black Grouse Alpha,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,45,"The Famous Grouse has been extended in various directions with varying degrees of success but for my money, this is the best and most logical. This is the version where the smoky, oily, spicy, and peaty notes of the original blend are brought more to the fore, but this works because married to it are grape and melon notes that ensure the Grouse lands softly.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
83,Hakushu Sherry Cask,48.0,Japanese,162,"Verging on the opaque, with a powerful resinous hit bringing to mind a luthier’s workshop with added Morello cherry, Turkish delight, and bitter chocolate, but on the tongue it is surprisingly sweet rather than tannic, with a supple feel, albeit with dried fruits dominating. This is a great example of what a small amount of heavy sherry can give to a vatting, but is it Hakushu? Sherry bomb lovers will adore it. £100",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
83,Cody Road Rye (Batch 5),40.0,Craft Whiskey,37,"A 100% rye whiskey, made from rye grown about 30 miles from Mississippi River Distilling. Strongly spicy and oily rye character reaching out of the glass and grabbing my nose; some surprising pastry and molasses notes hiding in there. The 40% mildness is disappointing at first, but develops into a spicy, minty mouth-filler with a cleanly sweet finish. On the sweet side, would prefer it drier.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
83,Clyde May's Conecuh Ridge,,Craft Whiskey,33,"Sweet corn and oak, with some green apple and grass notes; a light, pleasant nose that goes hot closer to the surface. Quite light and young in the mouth, clean, with understated oak notes; not taxing or tiring, and a long finish of teaberry and mint. Nothing amazing or overly complex, but a clean, pleasant sip of whiskey. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
83,Stagg Jr.,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The new, younger sibling to George T. Stagg. George T.’s signature is its bold nature and high proof, and Junior follows in its footsteps. The aromas are very nice: bold spice (clove, dusty mint, cinnamon, evergreen) with layers of burnt sugars, cocoa, charred oak, and berried fruit. However, on the palate, those sugars become dominated by aggressive spice, leather, and unnecessary tannin, most notably on the finish. Spend a little more and opt for George T. Stagg instead.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
83,Glenrothes 2001 (bottled 2012),43.0,Single Malt Scotch,67,"A typical Rothes nose, with vanilla, granola, apple, Brazil nut, lemon, and

low-level sweet spices mixing with lightly oxidized fruits. That said, it needs

water, especially for the palate, where the malty crispness of the undiluted

taste is replaced by something more considered, darkly fruity and gently spicy;

coriander is uppermost. All in all, this is Rothes in very approachable rather

than dynamic guise. One for a lazy afternoon.",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
83,Cedar Ridge Single Malt Whiskey Barrel 2,40.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Barrel 2 was aged in 15-gallon bourbon refills, then finished in a Cedar Ridge rum barrel; interesting to see an American distiller walk away from “straight whiskey” with used (small!) cooperage. Aromas of sawdust, toffee, melon and just-ripe apricot, dry cocoa, and warm cereal fight a bit with alcohol heat. Rum and fruit float over malt and vanilla in the mouth, and the wood rounds and dries. Oak and faint allspice in the finish. Needs some more taming; great start.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
83,Double Barrel Laphroaig/Mortlach,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,77,"This is one of the more intriguing of the Double Barrel series, because while the others either complement each other or don’t,

this has a depth to it that you need to look for. At first it’s all Laphroaig, and the peat and sea burst out of the glass. But just as you’re asking yourself what the point is, the fruity notes of the Mortlach cushion the whole landing and let you down gently. Impressive. £48",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
83,Snake River Stampede 8 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"They call it cowboy whisky: Smallish bottlers, mostly in the western U.S., buy custom-blended bulk whisky from Canada to release under their own label. This one has enough cachet to find its way back north and into the Canadian market. Sweet and smooth with rich buttery caramels, searing pepper, sizzling ginger, and slatey, dusty rye. Rich dark fruits on the palate turn to zesty citrus notes, then cleansing pith as one sip slowly dissolves into the next. C$25",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
83,Johnnie Walker Explorers’ Club Collection The Gold Route,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Described as “an exotic mix of bananas, mango, pitaya, pineapples, guava, passion fruit, and raisins, all balanced perfectly by deep charred peaty notes.” It sort of is, but this isn't a soft, silky smooth dessert whisky; it's Rod Stewart singing Air Supply's “All Out Of Love.” It's soft and gentle, but the gravel may put off the softies, and it's far too bland to appeal to fans of Maggie May. Between a rock and a hard place.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
83,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection #7 Heavy Char Barrel,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"There’s a reason why bourbon distillers don’t char their barrels to this intensity. Aged over 15 years, this is a bold whiskey, with lovely honeyed fruit and creamy vanilla on the nose and palate. But it’s bullied by the charred oak, brandishing oak tannins and leather, along with background tobacco and over-roasted nuts. Dry, charred oak finish. There’s a lovely sweetness that does challenge all this charred oak, but it eventually loses the battle. Price is per 375ml.",John Hansell,Summer 2013
83,Highland Park Svein,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Named after the Viking chieftain whose exploits are central to the Orkneyinga Saga, Svein is the least typically Highland Park of the initial three Warrior releases. The nose is oily, with starch and ozone, then ultimately freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juice. The palate offers a suggestion of smoke, sawdust, and vanilla. Nutty and slightly peppery in the finish, with just a suggestion of peat. €40/liter",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
83,Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask series (distilled at Littlemill) 21 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Matured in a refill hogshead, the out-turn was 262 bottles. The nose is malty, with the oiliness of figs, plus dates and tinned peaches. Supple on the palate, with vanilla, honey, and spicy resin notes. The finish is medium in length, warming, and slightly herbal, with nutmeg and malt. £90",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
83,Tullibardine 228 Burgundy,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Tullibardine 228 Burgundy is finished in red Burgundy casks from Chateau de Chassagne Montrachet, the home of Maison Michel Picard, which owns Tullibardine distillery. The nose features charred oak, vanilla, milk chocolate-covered Turkish Delight, and mild, sweet chili. Sweet and spicy on the nutty palate, with eating apples, cranberries, and a silky texture. Allspice and damsons in the lengthy finish. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
83,Tullibardine Sovereign,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Matured in first-fill bourbon casks for an unspecified period, Sovereign offers a nose that is floral with new-mown hay, vanilla, and soft fudge. Fruity on the palate, with milk chocolate, malt, and subtle cinnamon. Cocoa, vanilla, and more spice in the finish. Relatively uncomplicated but very drinkable. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
83,Kilchoman Machir Bay 2013 Release,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This year’s bottling mixes 4 and 5 year old bourbon casks with the younger element finished in oloroso, though this is hardly sherried. Here is smoke, samphire, and Kilchoman’s fleshy core giving echoes of 80s cuisine: scallops and white peaches anyone? Watering shows sea-washed rock, light flowers, and hot sand. The palate is sweet, sour, and smoky, with a chalky edge and a peppery palate, but water releases blossom and a little gunsmoke: a duel in the dunes? £39",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
83,Hanyu 5 of Diamonds 2000,57.0,Japanese,,"This, with finishing time in sherry wood, is the most straightforward of the quartet, showing lovely touches of Seville orange rather than heavy dried fruits. With water there’s a slight meaty/new leather note that seems a more natural companion to Hanyu’s density, here with an extra earthy note from black cherries, juniper, and star anise. Water triggers tannins but there’s enough fruit here to balance. The most successful of the four, with the wood in balance. ¥8,500",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
83,Hanyu 6 of Hearts 1991,,Japanese,,"Finished off in a 500-liter American oak puncheon, this has typical Hanyu robustness with a burnt edge hinting at roasted corn. A little touch of fresh varnish and wax polish adds a savory air before fruits come through: strawberry, sloe, and plum. The palate is, to this mouth, very, very hot. Water reveals more dense fruit, and on the palate there’s plenty of toasted oak, stewed rhubarb, and dry-roasted peanuts on the finish. A very solid example.¥12,000",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
83,Berry Bros. & Rudd (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 23 year old 1989,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,138,"Our second Bunna’, this is pale of hue with a surprising hint of salinity alongside a whiff of lemon sherbet, and an aroma like wet linen, while a floury maltiness runs below. Age however has twisted the fruits into the verge of musty over-ripeness. It’s explosive and spicy and, even though this is only 46%, it is hot. Water picks up the acidity before there’s a huge hit of warming ginger as the kiss-off. £89",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
83,Berry Bros. & Rudd (distilled at Imperial) 17 year old 1995,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The news that there’s a new distillery being built on the Imperial site is something to be celebrated. One hopes that the new plant makes whisky of the same character as the old, because Imperial is a classic single malt which is about fragrance (here pineapple and toasted marshmallows) and a clinging, seductive, cream soda quality. Whiskies like these are poems, they need you to concentrate. This is a touch rigid, but that’s a minor criticism of a gorgeous dram.  £60",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
83,The Macallan Amber,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Soft fruits are to the fore here; think of cooking green plums, fruit syrup, a hint of sultana to add to the sweetness, and then a hint of beeswax. There’s even a little of Macallan’s occasional earthiness, here akin to the damp sand floor of a sherry bodega. This is the transition point in the range with a similar weight to Gold but greater sweetness and the beginnings of Macallan’s mysterious savory edge. Have neat, with water, or ice. £45",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
83,The Macallan Gold,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,56,"Clean with the warming, sensual aroma of yeasty freshness that you get from freshly-baked bread. Stir in some almond butter, a little hay. The palate shows that it has substance behind this very open nose. Here is thickness, tongue-clinging oils, and a vibrant lemon note bringing to mind boiled travel sweets, before the dry maltiness comes through. With water — and it’s best lightly diluted — we’re looking at pastries. £36",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
83,St. George's Founder's Private Cellar Port Cask 0859,,Single Malt English Whisky,,"We’ve recorded the changing role of portwood use in whisky, with Tasmania and the likes of Amrut and Penderyn putting it center stage. St. George's hasn't…yet. But port clearly has momentum, because this has sold faster than the other two Founder's Private Cellar releases. Yet it doesn't quite work; the port is held in check so that the berry fruit compote, the earthiness of the malt, and a spearmint note clash with each other. £148",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
83,Old Hobart Overeem Port Cask Matured,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"If Tasmania is defining a distinctive whisky style, this is it. If you buy into the big red fruit and berry, full-frontal Aussie assault, accompanied by a rural earthiness, then this may be too ordered for you. But for most whisky drinkers exploring new territories the rounded red berry and orange fruits, and the full, rich, sweet center make it a perfect entry-level whisky to ease you in. A$130",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
83,Teeling Hybrid Malt Whisky Edition 1,,Miscellaneous,72,"Proof there is life after Cooley. Jack Teeling and whiskey innovator Alex Chasko kept the independent flame alive by moving on. This whisky isn&#039;t a revolution: it&#039;s a mix of Irish (Cooley) and scotch (Bruichladdich). That&#039;s not a new idea, and it does what you might predict. It starts with a sweet, fruity Irishness, then earthier, spicier Scottish notes kick in. It works fine, but this is a placeholder whisky. Expect a lot more in the coming months.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
83,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Linkwood) 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A catch-up rather than a new release, but a fascinating contrast to the 14 year old Flora & Fauna bottling. Yes, there’s apple blossom, but here there’s more medlar, fruit syrups, raspberry, and an intriguing play between vanilla and lightly oxidized nuttiness. Linkwood’s substance is shown on the palate, where an oily feel adds texture to the lush dried fruits and saffron-led spiciness. Best neat. An elegant dram.  ",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
83,St. George's Distiller's Elect,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"Without doubt this distillery is developing a core style, with peat the main variant over a grape, gooseberry, and lemon theme. This particular bottling is only available at the distillery, and to some degree treads water after a series of great releases. The smoke is quite light but assertive, and there's a pleasant spiciness on the palate to shake things up a little, but it doesn't punch as effectively as Chapter 11 or the rum cask offering. £45",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
83,Copper Fox Rye Whisky,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A 2:1 blend of rye and “hand-malted barley” lightly smoked with fruitwood, aged with apple and oak wood chips in used bourbon barrels, finished in another used bourbon barrel, aged 12 months total. Was it worth it? A good rye smell, with fruit notes; quite appealing. Relatively smooth, and the smoke comes through quickly, with sweet pepper spice and vanilla. Not overly complex, but well-made and pleasant.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
83,Telsington IV,,Liechtenstein,,"Brace yourself, it&#039;s about to get bumpy. Liechtenstein is a tiny principality in central Europe and the Telser distillery sited there takes its whisky very seriously. Every stage, from drying the barley over smoke first to the red wine casks used for maturation, is designed to make this different from scotch. You&#039;ll love it or hate it. The linseed oil nose isn&#039;t encouraging, but the liqueur-like flavors, with fir tree, furniture polish, and Rumtopf-style fruit compote have their own charm.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
83,Wild Turkey Rye,,Rye Whiskey,23,"The follow-up to 81 proof Wild Turkey bourbon—and part of a continuing trend by distillers to release versatile whiskey: reasonably priced, no age statement, that will stand out in cocktails but can be enjoyed on its own in a pinch. Very spicy, yet relatively soft in character, with suggestions of gin botanicals, dried fruits, honeyed vanilla, and teasing charred oak. Very quaffable for a rye whiskey. ",John Hansell,Fall 2012
83,"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1995 (Release 3, Cask #14007)",,Single Malt Scotch,,"With the hue of pigeon blood (a ruby, not a dead bird), initially this seems closed, but richness develops, mixing stewed Assam tea, chocolate biscuit, raisin, damson jam, and a whiff of tomato puree. The oak gives it the character of a Barolo Chinato. A knife and fork are needed to consume it, but for all the big tannins, there’s dark rose petal and the bittersweet edge of licorice. Dry, rich, and hermetic. For the hardcore sherry lover. 145 bottles.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
83,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Miltonduff) Cask No. 9461,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Turns quite murky with water, but don’t let this scare you off. Fragrant and flowery on the nose. A sweet whisky with a honeyed malt and creamy vanilla foundation, a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin, lime, pineapple), and soft oak on the finish. Pleasant enough, but I wish the flavors were crisper, cleaner, and more well-defined. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) ",John Hansell,Fall 2012
83,Rock Town Arkansas Young Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Smells sweet and minty, with gobs of oak and corn…and that’s about how it tastes, too. The corn sweetness and the mint are dominant, but warming oak spice wraps it loosely. It’s called “Young Bourbon” (labeled as “age under 4 years”), and that’s just what it tastes like, as some green youthful notes muscle their way in toward the finish. A bit of a rough-rider, but tasty. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
83,New Zealand South Island 18 year old,40.0,New Zealand,,"Eighteen years? Really? In what? If you're a fan of big oak, don't stop here. All the wood seems to have added is a muddy, earthy note to what is a good whisky struggling to keep its head above water. There's tart lemon meringue in the mix, and creamy crushed hazelnut, an array of spices, and some bread dough. But the earthiness is a distraction. Overall, a bit of a confused kiwi. NZ$126",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
83,The Famous Jubilee,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"A tribute this time from Edrington Group in the form of this one-off blend of The Famous Grouse. The sherried element seems to have been upped as it shows lavish amounts of dark chocolate, black cherry, and a little treacle, with some orange peel and, with water, raspberry and heather.  The palate shows a hint of smoke and builds through rich flavors to a toffee-accented finish. Subtle and long. £25",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
83,Tullibardine John Black 6 Single Cask 1993,,Single Malt Scotch,,"John Black is the veteran master distiller at Tullibardine distillery, and this is the sixth release to bear his name. The single malt in question was matured in bourbon barrel #10,002. Lemonade, dough, and maple on the nose. Progressively more floral, parma violets, pear drops, a hint of cinnamon, and milk chocolate in time. Hazelnuts and allspice on the palate, while citrus fruits emerge, plus more milk chocolate and a suggestion of cloves. Medium length, with nuts and oak.  £115",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
83,Southern Coast Single Malt Cask 3,46.0,Australian Whisky,,"What a difference a cask makes, say Southern Distillers, and they're not kidding. Just five casks have been made available so far, each one hand-crafted in traditional fashion by people who know what they're doing, and each one pushing out the envelope. This is the nuttiest and dustiest of the five and it wears its youth on its sleeve, but there are no feints and the whisky marks a step up in quality, with date, walnut, and golden syrup in the mix. A$110",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
83,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection (Made with Rice),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Light and airy on the nose, and delicately creamy on the palate. Gently sweet personality, with caramel custard, vanilla bean, candy corn, and crème brulee. Shows more oak on the palate than the nose, with increasing dried spice notes on the finish. A peculiar whiskey, if not overly complex or inspiring.Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
83,George Dickel No. 12,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"The most aggressive of the bunch, with the wood playing a dominant role. Toffee, rummy molasses, roasted nuts, barrel char, leather, tobacco, and a wisp of smoke.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
83,The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Br2 (distilled at Bruichladdich),,Single Malt Scotch,,"The second bottling from Bruichladdich in this range shows the ‘traditional‘ side of a distillery that is famed for the variety of its expressions. This, in other words, is Bruichladdich in its sweet, honeyed, gentle guise partnered with American oak to produce a mashed banana character, an unctuous palate, and a light touch of almond on the finish. Lovely. £55 (500 ml)",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
83,High West Son of Bourye (Batch 2),46.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"A blend of straight bourbon and rye whiskeys. A younger-tasting expression when compared to High West’s original Bourye. Pleasant enough to drink neat or with a splash of water, but that certainly wouldn’t be my first choice. Sweet foundation (caramel, vanilla custard, candy corn), along with honeyed fruit, macadamia, cinnamon, nutmeg, and soft mint. Comes across as a bit confused at times, and the flavors aren’t always well defined.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
83,Wemyss Malts ‘Lemon Grove’ (distilled at Cragganmore) 1989 (bottled 2011),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Cragganmore is a whisky that typically needs time before it starts to get going and which then goes through many changes on its journey to its complex, layered apogee. Here it is at a slightly contradictory midpoint. The nose is fragrant and fruity: apricots, stewed apple, and yes, lemon; and, with water, a hint of smoke. The palate meanwhile shows more of the earthy depth and sloe berry richness that will slowly emerge. A pleasing dram, nonetheless. £75",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
83,Red Stag Black Cherry,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Smells like sweet, dead-ripe cherries, mashed up in bourbon with some brown sugar and just a dust of cinnamon. It's sweet, a bit thick, but 80 proof warming, and the bourbon — the Beam cinnamon note comes out clearer now — is dominant over the cherries here. The finish sees more cinnamon, even a hint of barrel oak, and manages to dry out a bit.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
83,Pearse Lyons Reserve,40.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),,"Hard to say what this is: the label just says “WHISKEY.” My nose, though, says “Irish whiskey.” Grassy malt, sweet heat, light pear esters. It's there in the mouth, too: smooth sweet malt, vaporous lift off the tongue, Irish light elegance, and a lingering finish with a slippery hint of vanilla. Considering the eponymous distiller is Irish... Nice stuff; now tell us more about it. ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
83,Breizh,42.0,French Whisky,,"The price tag — higher than the entry level single malt — gives an indication as to what to expect from this blend, and it's a cracker. Made with 50 percent grain and 50 percent malt, the taste here is punctuated by a distinctive and unusual salt and pepper delivery. Beyond that there's creamy vanilla, soft peach, and a creamy rounded finish. It really dares to be different. €32 ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
83,Miltonduff 19 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"One in a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.



Miltonduff was licensed in 1824, and these days is also an important blender’s malt with a little more oily depth than its neighbor, Glenburgie. This has a deep floral bouquet — think iris and lily — and aromatic fruits like quince. With water there’s moss, sage, and orange peel. The fruity character is dominant in the mouth and becomes more tropical; there’s even some coconut on the finish. £40 ",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
83,Lark Single Cask,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"Expecting Scotch single malt? Go to the door and kick that thought right down the garden. Open your mind. Consider Australia as you do bourbon or Irish whiskey. It’s whisky, but not as the Scots know it — a new branch to the whisky tree. This is different, but special. Fresh, clean, young green apple, and pear, and not much else. But there’s a distinctive herbal rootsiness here that’s all Australian. There’s a clean sweet purity to the malt, too. Impressive. AUD150 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
83,Singleton of Dufftown 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Diageo’s Singleton range is its answer to the problem of how to build a global single malt brand when each distillery will ultimately be limited by its capacity. Answer? A single brand: ‘Singleton,’ but from three distilleries, each focused on a different area of the world. Singleton of Dufftown is Europe’s expression, and this 15 year old combines cake mix, peanut butter, and fleshy fruits. There’s dried banana and vanilla on the palate, and a nutty sweet finish. £38 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
83,Singleton of Glendullan 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The U.S. Singleton comes from Glendullan, a distillery that makes a sweet, light spirit. Here, a percentage has been aged in ex-sherry casks, which has added a layer of fruity sweetness — think port-like sloe notes, Muscatel, and wisteria. The wood is lightly handled, allowing the aromas full rein on the palate.",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
83,Signatory 11 year old 1999 vintage (distilled at Bowmore),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Aged in a used bourbon barrel. Rather soft for Bowmore — especially for its age — with a gentle foundation of honey, vanilla, and malt. Interwoven notes of summer fruit, coconut, lime, and gentle peat, with teasing brine and smoke on the finish. A straightforward, unpretentious, pleasant Bowmore. ",John Hansell,Summer 2011
83,Glenfiddich Snow Phoenix,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Second of this pair of limited editions from Glenfiddich. This was named after a number of the distillery’s warehouse roofs collapsed under the weight of snow in 2010. This was a bottling of a selection of casks — ex-sherry, ex-bourbon, refill — from one of those damaged warehouses. It is gentle and sweet — cooked pear, fruit crumble topped with rolled oats, golden syrup, and on the palate hints of raisin. A lemon finish adds a freshness to a dangerously drinkable dram.",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
83,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1991,,Single Malt Scotch,156,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The youngest of the quintet has been aged in refill sherry hogsheads, but the coconut that immediately assails the nostrils suggests they were made from American oak. Alongside this is the distillery’s signature pineapple note which sits under a scented, floral lift. Water adds a further layer of ripe pear. The palate is equally heightened with a powdery feel. It’s pretty discreet and I’d be cautious with any dilution. The finish is a mix of night-scented stocks, custard, and green apple. £95",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
83,"Jim Beam “Devil’s Cut,” 45%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"More wood influence than the standard Jim Beam White Label. It’s a bit more robust, bolder, and with more wood spices (especially cinnamon and vanilla) and a curious botanical note. Throw in some corn, caramel, and honey, and this is what you get. Behind all that, I’m detecting a bit of youthfulness — I might like this bourbon with more age and less “devil.”",John Hansell,Summer 2011
83,"Belgian Owl 4 year old, cask 270910",46.0,Belgian Whisky,,"Belgian whisky maker Etienne Bouillon has a strange production process, including maturation in modern, warm, and strip-lighted warehouses on an industrial estate, but he’s no slouch when it comes to whisky making, and he counts Bruichladdich’s Jim McEwan among his friends. This is melon and vanilla ice cream on the nose; banana, burnt rind, and a sprinkling of pepper on the palate. Youth reveals itself late, but this is dessert whisky at its best. €47 Currently not available in the U.S.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
83,Woodstone Creek Single Malt “The Murray Barrel”,,Single Malt American Whiskey,,"Nice color for a 10 year old. Puffing peat off the glass, with briny notes and sweetness: promising. The promise is kept in the mouth, too. It’s all there: peat smoke, brine, good round malt, some fruity notes in the finish, and a nice creamy texture. There’s a bit of astringency, and it’s hot for the proof. Still, a very convincing American iteration of a peated single malt, especially at this age.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
83,Ledaig 10 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,49,"Tobermory’s peated offering. Great to see Ledaig hitting its stride, with a brisk punch of peat and not chill-filtered. There’s a bit of a raw edge too, quite bracing but still plenty of soothing sweetness. Earthy peat smoke, ripe barley, honeyed vanilla, bourbon barrel char, black licorice stick, espresso bean, olive brine, and suggestions of beef jerky. In some respects, it even tastes younger than 10 years old, but I’m balancing that with bonus points for distinctiveness.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
84,Coppersea Excelsior Straight Bourbon (Batch 1901),48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Overripe fruit, orange Creamsicle (and its stick), cedar oil, and wood spice on the nose. The palate is tannic with robust orange, oak, cinnamon, cherry Luden’s cough drops, and herbal cough syrup. It finishes on oak, chocolate, nuts, and cinnamon—a bit hot, but softened with generous water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Reserve Rye Finished with Rum,40.0,Miscellaneous,50,"Not a rum cask-finished rye, but a blend of Kentucky straight rye with Canadian rye and added blackstrap rum. The experience is sweet from start to finish: Sugar Babies and their parent Sugar Daddy on the nose, along with molasses, raisins, kettle corn, maple donuts, toasted marshmallow, and a little grassiness on the nose. The palate is sugary-sweet, with molasses, pralines, coffee ice cream, Raisinets, and some bitter oak, and it finishes short. Keep an eye on your blood sugar when drinking this.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,"Doc Swinson’s Rum Cask-Finished Rye (Release 02, Barrel 09)",45.0,Rye Whiskey,30,"Fruity and earthy on the nose, with orange Fanta, mixed berry compote, lemon drops, chamomile tea, fragrant oak, and caraway. The palate is sweet and gently herbal, with orange oil, cinnamon candy, chocolate, old-fashioned cough drops, and spearmint. Cinnamon-spiced pecans, chocolate, and sweet oak on the relatively short finish. This is simple but tasty—a painting in primary colors.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Blinking Owl California Straight Bourbon (Batch 3),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"The barrel shows itself up front: cigar box, fresh pencils, dried chili, allspice, and tea leaves, along with a touch of honeydew. The palate is roasty and oak-driven: chili powder, cacao, roasted nuts, and savory, salty grilled meat. An austere finish, with white pepper, dry oak, and cocoa powder.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Buckshee Straight Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,42,"The nose starts out with orange blossom, lemon zest, licorice, iced tea, and confectioners’ sugar, set against pine forest notes and a hint of minerality. The palate is light, with orange pekoe tea, vanilla, baked apples and cloves, and more pine. The finish is also light and somewhat brief, with pleasurable notes of spice, as well as figs, brown sugar, and an overlay of white pepper. Some interesting notes on offer.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
84,Savage & Cooke The Burning Chair Bourbon,44.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"Light in aroma, with nougat, pistachio halvah, fresh lilies, and the chalkiness of general store candy. Flavor and mouthfeel are also subtle, sometimes too much so; while there are lovely floral and fruit notes, along with spices, pistachio, toasted grain, and orange oil, a bit more amplitude would go a long way.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
84,Murray McDavid 2010 Peatside 6 year old,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,"The nose is pleasant, with fresh strawberry, spicy smoke, cookie dough, allspice, and glacé cherry, but the palate fails to shine or excite. This has been finished in port and Pedro Ximénez casks, giving the whisky a subtle rose hue, but it needs more body. There are flavors of biscuit, mandarin, vanilla, and redcurrant. It meanders along with a fairly flat trajectory, then hits the buffers with some lingering rosehip fruitiness. (2,266 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
84,Devils River Small Batch Texas Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"The nose begins with lemon and lime, followed by notes of licorice root and dill. The palate is smoother and sweeter, if a bit light, with notes of cherry, chocolate, cinnamon, and new oak. The addition of water reveals flavors of orange pekoe tea, peanut shells, a richer note of chocolate, and a dusting of chili powder. Some barrel influence on the palate, but the finish concludes with chocolate, sassafras, and bitter almond oil.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
84,Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye,40.0,Miscellaneous,40,"A blend of American rye, Canadian rye, and port. Gentle spice and sweet vanilla appear on the nose, but the impression of browning apple, wet leaves, and oxidized red wine are somewhat dreary. Simple and sweet up front, it feels thin, like fake maple syrup, with more sweet vanilla carried on a rather light body, almost resembling some rice whiskies.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
84,Duncan Taylor Octave (distilled at North British) 2009 9 year old,52.0,Single Grain Whisky,80,"Sharp citrus notes, like an unruly spritz of grapefruit juice first thing in the morning. This is an assertive dram with aromas of lemon bonbon, sour fruits, toffee, fruit sodas, and a whiff of potions and unguents wafting from the back room of a pharmacy. It floats between sweet and sour fruits, settling on a sweet lemon mush wedged between some nibbling spices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
84,Spirits of French Lick The Wheater Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"A blend of two straight bourbons—a pot still expression from Spirits of French Lick, double distilled and aged 2 years, and a pot-and-column still bourbon sourced from a Wyoming distillery, aged 7 years. A youthful nose is grain-forward and restrained, with notes of dried leaves, crushed juniper berries, and licorice. A palate of bitter orange and black tea, finishing with clove, baking spices, bitter chocolate, and baked apple.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
84,Stone Breaker Blended Whiskey,46.0,Multinational Whisky,46,"From Restless Spirits of Kansas City, Missouri, a blend of 4 year old Irish whiskey and their own-make pot still whiskey. A gentle nose of pine bough, fennel seed, citrus oil, licorice, and potpourri, with a veneer of lemon candy. The palate tastes young but sweet and creamy, blending vanilla, bitter orange, and spicy pepper with a raisiny Chunky bar note and chocolate-covered almonds. Finishes with more chocolate, orange, and a subtle nuttiness.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
84,Dusko Fine Whiskey,40.0,Spanish Whisky,40,"A dull stewed-fruit note with polished apples, pink blancmange, rose hip, and a dash of spice, but not a very demonstrative whisky. The body is light and flimsy, even for a 3 year old blend, and the palate offers the return of that sweet pink blancmange, light caramel, and the sweetness of candy cigarettes. It crosses the line with late sugary sweetness and a short peppery finish. Life’s all about choices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
84,Bainbridge Battle Point Organic Wheat,43.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"A nose of white pepper and spice, as well as salty brine, light sea smoke, and toasted wood, followed by white chocolate, confectionery sweetness, and wild berries. Rich and full on a front palate that’s somewhat youthful, led by notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, marzipan, and treacle, with lemon and almond adding some zest. The finish lingers, with a hint of salinity and toasted wood, as well as light smoke.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
84,Kirkland,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Earthy, with corn husk and biscuit dough on the nose, along with cooked apples, white pepper, and a light spice. Honey, almond meal, toasted marshmallow, and a hint of lemon make for a simple, somewhat grainy palate. It finishes short and sweet, with some cinnamon heat. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Kirkland 6 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"Sweet, fruity, and floral, with orange-blossom water, Juicy Fruit gum, toasted coconut, and honey. The palate is simple and grain-forward, with vanilla, coconut, and frosted cookie. Light, facile, and very sweet, this whisky won’t satisfy those seeking complexity, but works well for uncomplicated sipping. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Cadée Straight Rye,42.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Light and delicate characteristics abound. The nose has raspberries and orange peel, along with fresh-cut wood, iced tea, and rose petals. Wood dominates the palate, lifted by gentle spice, rock candy, walnut shell, stewed plums, and grain. The finish is short, with cola, wood, and bread.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Woody Creek Colorado Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,49,"Aromas of spiced orange and lemon, cedar, bubblegum, and caramel spar with the fresh wood aromas of a sawmill. On the palate, ginger, white pepper, and oak are counterbalanced by a wave of sweetness: orange oil, bubblegum, and strawberry-flavored Fruit Roll-Ups. A touch of water benefits this somewhat simple pour.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Ensign Red,40.0,Canadian,24,"Walk into a pastry shop and inhale the aromas of coconut cake, confectioners’ sugar, lemon cream, almond paste, and vanilla. Then take a sip: coconut custard, slivered almonds, vanilla, and sweet bread dough. The grain whisky is at the forefront here, lending simplicity and insistent sweetness. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,MacQueens of Scotland 3 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,13,"The nose is grassy and light, with some youthful heat, orange blossom, vanilla, coconut, and cedar. A clean palate of lemon, orange, vanilla, banana, and toasted coconut leads into a simple finish of oak and more vanilla. Basic, but well balanced. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Fistful of Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Some pleasant warm cereal notes emerge, like Quaker oats with cinnamon and brown sugar. The palate offers peanuts and spices, however young spirit juts out, with green stick and slightly antiseptic flavors out of synch with the ample toasted oak. Blind tasted twice with consistent notes.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
84,Meyer’s Blend Supérieur,40.0,French Whisky,35,"Fresh, sharp citrus with lighter elements: floral notes, orange macaroons, and wisps of cotton candy. Lemon peel, tinned mandarin, and tangy grapefruit on the palate, with deeper notes of lemon curd, gooseberry, confectioners’ sugar, and a minor spice note. This delivers a narrow spectrum of flavor for a blend.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
84,Trader Joe’s 8 year old Speyside,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,20,"If you aren’t expecting it, the herbaceous, grassy, mineral aromas are a surprise, more expected in an agave spirit than a typical Speysider. But there’s something entrancing about the herbal flavors of tarragon, licorice tea, chestnut honey, and saline, which resolve into a lightly sweet, slightly spiced finish. This is unusual, but beguiling. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Trader Joe’s Kentucky Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"The nose is innocuous, with some cinnamon, herbal iced tea, sweet oranges, cedar, and dry oak. Sweet and wood-forward on the palate, it is also drying and hot, with herbal tea, orange oil, chocolate, cinnamon, and cherry cough syrup. While there are flavors to enjoy here, they seem to need more time to fully develop. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Rock Town Arkansas Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Bourbon made with Arkansas corn, soft red winter wheat, and malted barley. White flowers, citrus, fresh dill, and wet cardboard on the nose. The palate is woody and somewhat harsh, with some chocolate, raspberry, and ground pepper flavors. Quite dry, with tannic oak and sticky pine. Bitter oak on the finish. Primarily wood-driven; the oak overpowers the other flavors.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
84,Cascade Blonde American,40.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),20,"Oak-forward with gentle sweetness and light in body, this is a simple and enjoyable enough, with straightforward vanilla and toasted nuts. The finish is a touch astringent, as the drying oak tannins slightly overwhelm the modest fruit.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
84,Liberty Pole Peated Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,57,"Heat and peat dominate the nose—this is young and fiery, with rubber, bonfire, cedar chest, charred corn, and apple aromas. The palate continues to burn, though with a nice amount of grilled meat, red fruit, and flavored tobacco notes, especially when water is added. Unfortunately, the smoke is not so well-integrated and it shows on the finish, which has a cloying sweet ashiness.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
84,Johnnie Walker Red Label,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice, a twist of lemon, dried orange peel, peppercorn, cracker bread, and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple, gentle fudge, and good-tempered spices, with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild, agreeably smooth, without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
84,Evan Williams,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,15,"Commonly referred to as Black Label, the color is noticeably dark for a younger,  less than 8 year old product like this. The nose takes it a step forward with burnt  brown sugar, fruit, and cinnamon. But the palate reveals its youth with a mouthful  of grains and acidity. However, it’s saved by final notes of honey, vanilla, caramel,  soft oak, and coconut. A short finish disappoints, but this is a cocktail or cola contender.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
84,Paddy,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,20,"This summons up plenty of snappy grain notes, with green apple, melon rind, and zested lemon bumping into dried chili, green tomato, damp hay bales, and a dose of spice. It’s sweeter than a kitten with a ball of wool: lemon bonbons, toffee, vanilla cream, banana chews, zesty mandarin, apple, butterscotch, pepper, and clove. Sour apple pips, burnt sugar and spice, and some residual vanilla creaminess see it out.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
84,Zackariah Harris,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,12,"Florals and fruit begin a soft and delicate journey. For such a light whiskey, it’s certainly heavy on cherries, stone fruit, apples, and marmalade, followed by toffee, coffee, bananas, and chocolate. A drop of water shows how delicate it is, and the short finish suggests this whiskey would be leaps and bounds better with ten more degrees of proof.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
84,Rieger’s Kansas City Whiskey,46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Seems to show good maturity on the nose, with nutty, herbal, woody, and husky grain aromas. The notes of warm porridge with brown sugar portend the sweet palate, almost cloying with ripe red fruits. Warm, chocolaty, and spicy, but the somewhat hot finish and dusty oak floorboard quality don’t leave the best lasting impression.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
84,North of 7,45.0,Canadian,47,"A mash of 95% local rye and 5% malted barley is distilled on the grain, then matured for 3-plus years in new, custom toasted, full-sized bourbon barrels. Expect loads of vanilla and bold barrel notes over dry grass and nutty clean grain. Despite the hot, spicy intensity, lovely mild sweet lemon notes come right to the front. Bottled barrel by barrel, so expect some minor variability. Look for a red stripe on the label. (Canada only) $60 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
84,Jack Daniel’s Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,27,"What begins as a banana, oat, and Malt-O-Meal delight turns into honey and potato chips. This is followed by cookie dough, dark cherries, sweet-potato chips, beets, dehydrated pineapple, pine nuts, and oak. Its medium finish offers a mouthful of banana. If you love banana, you’ll love this whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
84,John Barr Reserve,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay whisky for 25 years. The nose has spice, toffee, wheat biscuits, and smoke, but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy, lightweight, and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain, there are flavors of graham cracker, chocolate ganache, well-baked fruitcake, banoffee pie, smoke, and dried peels, with a burst of spices on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
84,Tanner’s Creek Blended Bourbon,,American Blended Whiskey,35,"It begins with flowers, cardamom, fresh-cut walnut wood, and mint. Notes of fruit, pomace, applesauce, pineapple, and vanilla-iced strawberries take over, but smoke, pear, and apple dominate thereafter. A shorter than expected finish presents hints of chocolate, candied corn, and more smoke. Very nice for punches.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
84,The Pogues,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"Named for the greatest London-Irish band of the 1980s, this produces stewed apple, raisin, vanilla cream, peppercorn, grated nutmeg, and a dirty ol’ mound of dunnage earth. A fiesta of apple, pineapple, grapefruit, bitter lemon, subdued honey, and caramel transition into stewed apples, rhubarb, lemon bonbons, and sweet vanilla. Lingering bitterness, like the band’s split. It’s a Big Apple Fairytale, but for the money, better streams of whiskey are available.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
84,Exclusive Regions Single Grain (distilled at North British) 10 year old,50.0,Single Grain Whisky,55,"The nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it, like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon. In addition to acetone, there is orange fondant and the smell of new Legos. Soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy, soft peaches, and pineapple, but it’s all swept aside by a Tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate. Finish of Gatorade fruit punch and ginger root. (246 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
84,Jamie Stewart,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,16,"With whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels, this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee, vanilla, toasted whole grain bread, and light spices. The mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices, especially cinnamon and pepper, are quelled by malty caramel, baked orange, and touches of old leather. The finish is dry, malty, and slightly nutty, with a hollow core of spices. A bit dour overall.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
84,Ensign Red,40.0,Canadian,20,"A slightly closed nose opens to pleasing meatiness, then green fruits with hints of evergreen. The palate is sweet and surprisingly rich, although fairly simple. Strong peppery spices and something pleasantly vegetal creep in. Slowly, the sweetness becomes unctuous, turning an otherwise fine sipping whisky into a mixer. Brisk spices provide a counterpoint to the sweetness, but the balance seems off. Some structure finally develops around suggestions of dark chocolate.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2017
84,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glentauchers) 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,76,"It will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. Golden Grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
84,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Caledonian) 29 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,74,"As young a Caledonian as you’ll find; I found the nose rather underdeveloped. Crystallized lemon slices, green banana, solvents, dry grasses, and a sniff of nail polish remover. In the mouth, lemon flavors, saccharine sweet honey, and banana dipped in melted chocolate, while the alcohol nips at the tongue. A good trajectory redeems its character, leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish, with bitter citrus at the fringes.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
84,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 25 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,49,"More typical grain whisky territory here, with a nose of cornflakes, fresh cream, cut grass, filaments of orange peel, and a curiously dull pepper note. Spice, sweetness, and citrus fight for dominance. Spice wins with a K.O. on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas. Creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish, though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
84,Lord Calvert Black,40.0,Canadian,13,"This is pipeline whisky made to be used in a Highball. That said, Lord Calvert is a solid blend to begin with and this beefed-up version makes all the right noises for cocktails or mixing with ginger ale. Sweet caramels, hot peppers, and hints of dry grain are bolstered by ripe dark fruits and spicy rye. This is simple, well-made whisky that shines best when mixed.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2017
84,Westland Sherry Wood Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"Sweet vanilla, dried berries, and a soft display of woodsmoke introduce this whiskey. While notably improved from earlier bottlings, the sherry is still rendered a bit dull, like chocolate-covered cherries, as smoky cocoa nibs and the chewy malt meet on the palate, offering a honeyed finish with hints of baking chocolate.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
84,Oola Discourse Three Shores Whiskey,47.0,Multinational Whisky,55,"A blend of Highlands scotch, Canadian whisky, and house-made high-rye whiskey. Aromas of stewed red fruit, pomegranate, and mint hold promise, but the whiskey is quiet, with subtle peach, unripe raspberry, apricots, and white flowers. White chocolate, cornbread, and biscotti flavors add a good deal of sweetness. The finish is pleasant and rounded. An interesting experiment, but it’s hard to discern what each component brings to the table.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2017
84,Wildrye Five Drops Montana Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Herbal, licorice, and cinnamon notes are initially quite alluring, but stifled by a slightly sour note peering through. Still, this is identifiably bourbon, with sweet corn drive, leathery oak, and cocoa coming together nicely before a warming finish of spice candies.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
84,Ezra Brooks,45.0,Rye Whiskey,19,"Distilled and aged in Indiana, it’s herbal, floral, and slightly fruity, with a hint of cherry syrup. Resounding dried apricot and peach cobbler are followed by concentrated caramel and vanilla, creating a very pleasing and easy-drinking whiskey. Although not complex nor with a strong finish, it’s perfectly balanced by intense notes. Perfect for cocktails or table whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
84,Reservoir Rye Whiskey,50.0,Craft Whiskey,100,"There is a rich and robust distillate lurking under all that oak, with chewy maple candies, chocolate-covered cherries, and <em>rhum agricole</em> intensity. The astringent oak does no favors for the heat of this 100-proof whiskey, but with its lingering dark chocolate and char it’s still a bold and tasty rye.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
84,Smooth Ambler Wheated Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Limited by its obvious youth on the nose, but the fresh herb chiffonade character offers intrigue, with distinct sage coupled with some chamomile notes. The palate is a step in the right direction, with dark berries, spices, vanilla, and charred marshmallows, although somewhat light bodied and supple in texture. Young, but sweet and honest.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
84,West Cork Port Cask Finish 12 year old,43.0,Irish,66,"Just 6 months in a port pipe have dressed this whiskey with aromas of Kola Kubes, savory spices, and meat juices, plus the whiff of a damp dog licking your face. Palate of cherry lips, golden delicious apple, and a peppery bite, it careens toward plum, bitter fruit skins, and a medicinal ending of aniseed-laced cough syrup. Like young vintage port, this still has more than a few sharp edges.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
84,West Cork Sherry Cask Finish 12 year old,43.0,Irish,66,"Prune juice and some fresh cream on the nose. The sticky palate delivers flavors of apple juice, tangerine, and gooseberry. The spices get popping, growing peppery, but despite the ripe fruits, it could benefit from more sweetness. The long spicy finish is redolent of aniseed throat lozenges. It would have been fascinating to taste the unfinished whiskey or a version after a longer sherry finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
84,Rabbit Hole Rye,,Rye Whiskey,60,"At 95% rye and 5% malted barley, it’s initially an herbal and floral bomb, with slight hints of earth and rising bread dough. Then cinnamon, and lots of it, over nutmeg, baked apples, clove, ginger, and molasses. An explosion of cracked black pepper dominates toward the medium finish with a slight hint of baked pear. Tasty as a summer sipper or cocktail base.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
84,Black Bull 12 year old,50.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,55,"A solid presence in the range, the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. Grapefruit peels, sliced juicy orange, and lemon butter icing on the nose. The palate is thinner than others in the range, with crystallized orange, fudge, plus cardamom and mild pepper. The finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
84,Clyde May’s Straight Bourbon,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"This is a non-chill filtered bottling. Initially, it’s perfume-centric with highly floral notes until a grain neutralizer sets in, with hints of caramel and vanilla. Cornbread, honey, and slight hints of pepper, herbs, and tobacco. Finishes short with a mouthful of lovely sweet corn pudding.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
84,The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Benachie,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,43,"Benachie, formerly known as Jericho, was an Aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of Huntly that existed from 1822–1913. A dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade, ground almond, cherry lips, and vanilla essence. Attractive, but not overly aromatic. Cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey, exiting with a spicy finale.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
84,Mulligan’s Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,27,"Caramel corn, vanilla cream, citrus, evergreen, and a peppering of cinnamon. Soft oak finish. Pleasant, straightforward, youthful, and uncomplicated. Would prefer to see it bottled at a higher strength.",John Hansell,Spring 2017
84,Bone Snapper Rye Batch No. 4,54.0,Rye Whiskey,35,"When one imagines the Indiana ryes, this maximizes every note on the nose, warming up with mint, dill, oak, macerated cherries, and a ton of baking spices. There’s a bit of a medicinal palate property in cherry throat lozenge form, followed by oak and chocolate. Its best attribute is an unexpected long finish with a big bite of candied ginger.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
84,Mosswood Barrel Aged American Whiskey 9 year old,46.0,Miscellaneous,50,"Finished in barrels that once held <em>nocino</em>, a walnut liqueur. This whiskey immediately offers chocolate, oak, leather, vanilla, roasted pecans, and smoke-fired marshmallow. Then port, oatmeal stout, cherry cola, nutmeg, applesauce, roasted nuts, and caramel. The final notes are soft, but an extremely short finish erodes the palate’s promise.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
84,A.D. Laws Secale Bottled in Bond Straight Rye (Batch BBL #4),50.0,Craft Whiskey,75,"A nice jolt of violets, pepper, and sawn oak on the nose is underscored by some green stick and leafy sassafras notes, turning a bit more dark and chewy on the palate, with caramel, figgy fruit, green peppercorns, and a long and bold finish dominated by dark chocolate. Softens up nicely with water, and reveals more fruitiness.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
84,Jameson Bold,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,38,"The second installment in the deconstruction of Jameson Original, this is a punchy, pot still-led whiskey with a nose of white peppercorn, cinnamon breakfast cereal, whole nutmeg, and a chocolate-coconut slice. Soft, waxy beginning, strong vanilla flavors, golden syrup, fresh apple, and huge barley notes, though the spices are surprisingly easygoing. It’s worth comparing to its brothers, Lively and Round. Of the trio, this is closest to Original. Peppery finish with long lasting barley sweetness. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive</i>) €36",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
84,BenRiach Peated Quarter Casks,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,81,"This peated expression was matured in quarter casks and is the first bottling to be launched since BenRiach was acquired by Brown-Forman in April 2016. The nose offers sweet peat and new leather, coal, and a hint of iodine. White pepper and big peat notes on the palate. Ripe apples develop and spices spread around the mouth. The finish is medium in length, warming, and gently smoky. £65",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Benromach Hermitage 2007,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"Initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years, the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée.<b> </b>Soft on the nose, with fresh red berries, oiled leather, cinnamon, and a hint of smoke. Rich, slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate, plus milk chocolate and lively spices. Initially fruity, then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Glenfiddich IPA Experiment,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"One of the duo of releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, ‘IPA’ was finished for 3 months in casks that previously held the Speyside Craft Brewery’s India pale ale. The nose offers hops and honey, malt, toffee, cooking apples, and lemon. Smooth on the palate, with more honey and toffee, soft spices and, ultimately, slightly bitter, hoppy ale notes. The finish is medium in length, with dry spices and plain chocolate.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Tomatin Cabernet Sauvignon 2002,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,87,"Initially aged in bourbon barrels, this expression was transferred into Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks in March 2011 for additional maturation. Musty wine notes on the early nose soon become red berries and vanilla. Supple on the palate, with big red berry notes, plus honey and ginger. Lingering ginger and raspberries in the finish, drying to dark chocolate (2,520 bottles) £70",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Tomatin Caribbean Rum 2007,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"This 9 year old bottling has been fully matured in Caribbean rum barrels. Quite delicate on the nose, with wet grass, then emerging coconut and whipped cream. Slick on the palate, with an instant tropical fruit hit—ripe banana and pineapple—plus more cream, cinnamon, and hazelnut. Spicy and nutty in the finish, with a final tropical fruit tang (6,600 bottles) £40",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Tullibardine Custodians’ Release 1970,,Single Malt Scotch,1900,"The second release in the Custodians’ series was matured in two sherry hogsheads—one first-fill and the other second-fill. This 46 year old is presented at cask strength. The early nose offers herbal and menthol notes, old resin, citrus fruits, then milk chocolate-coated peppermint creams… idiosyncratic. The palate is quite thin, with more citrus fruits, almonds, and developing wood notes. The finish is lightly oaky and mouth-drying, with a touch of black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Smooth Ambler Yearling,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,24,"At 3 years, 6 months, this whiskey shows so much promise. As most young bourbons do, this one starts with hints of oak and a mouthful of corn that develops into cornbread and corn pudding over subtle hints of pralines and chocolate. Then out of nowhere, raw almonds and pecan shell. The medium finish ends with a touch of cinnamon. High hopes for this one. In another year or two, we could be talking about something really special. Price is per 375 ml.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
84,Hepburn’s Choice (distilled at Blair Athol) 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,56,"This single cask bottling from Langside Distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. Candied orange peel on the early nose, soft sweet sherry, and glacé cherries. Fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight. Sweet, spicy sherry, plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. Fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles, <i>Robertsons of Pitlochry exclusive</i>) £45",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Five & 20 Spirits Rye (batch 3),45.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"There is lovely freshness here, with sawn oak, bread dough, and baking spice aromas. Despite the generous 80% rye content, the malt component really comes through, offering good backbone, creamy caramel sweetness, and approachability. A streak of pleasingly peppery rye is balanced with sweet vanilla, leading to a lively finish with mint and chocolate malt balls.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
84,Wolfburn The Kylver Series,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,81,"Matured in bourbon casks, this is the second release from the fledgling Caithness Distillery. Clearly youthful on the nose, but not raw, with ginger, melon, and background resin. Ultimately, mildly floral. Chili notes on the relatively dry palate, with nutmeg and spicy oak. The finish is on the short side of medium in length, peppery, and slightly bitter. Once decanted, this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1,200 bottles)£65",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
84,Bowmore 2016 vintage Fèis Ìle,,Single Malt Scotch,71,"This vatting of three virgin oak casks and one <em>oloroso</em> butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds, all 1,500 bottles of it. It shows Bowmore, that ever-changing, elusive Islay dram in perfumed, scented mode. I picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne), but also peach, some flamed peels, and plenty of smoke. The palate dips into the sea for a second, then again becomes scented, alongside gentle chocolate. Amazing price too. £55",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
84,Bunnahabhain Amontillado 16 year old,54.0,Single Malt Scotch,325,"Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that’s drifting into meaty. Brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dry…but the price? Ouch! (<em>Fèis Ìle 2016</em>, 250 bottles) £250",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
84,Edradour Ballechin Sauternes Cask Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"The eighth edition of heavily-peated Edradour bottled under the Ballechin label is part of the distillery’s Discovery Series and has been aged in Sauternes wine casks. The nose yields sweet, fruity smoke, cocoa, and spice. Sweet and soft on the palate, with more fruity smoke, notably pineapple-influenced, with a hint of smoked fish. The finish is medium to long, with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
84,Glen Grant 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,56,"<p class=""bodynoindent""><span style=""letter-spacing: .05pt;"">A new addition to the core range, this shows Glen Grant with a little more weight, but just a little. I’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. Here, the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers, fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup, toffee, and cooked fruits on the palate. If you’d like an alternative to Glenlivet or Glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
84,Glenglassaugh Octaves Classic,44.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Glenglassaugh distillery launched both unpeated and peated expressions matured in octave casks, approximately one-eighth the capacity of a butt. They have not been subjected to chill-filtration. The nose of this unpeated Classic is sweet, with ripe apples, peaches, toffee, and buttery spice. Smooth on the palate, with more peaches and now intense spiciness, followed by vanilla, aniseed, licorice, new oak, and mild cloves in the long, slightly citric finish. £55",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
84,Wemyss Malts Banquet of Fruits 1994 (distilled at Aberfeldy),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,131,"Distilled in 1994 and matured in a single hogshead, this 21 year old expression is part of Wemyss Malts’ 2016 Midsummer Single Cask Release. Rich, stewed fruits, honey, and allspice on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous on the palate with spicy apple and cranberry. The finish dries quite rapidly to aniseed and spicy oak. (220 bottles) £100",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
84,Wemyss Malts Rosy Apple Brûlée  (distilled at Invergordon) 1988,46.0,Single Grain Whisky,115,"Perfect for fall; like strolling through an orchard polishing a windfall apple before crunching into its juicy fruit. Nose of caramel, dry worked wood, banana chips, cinnamon, and Indian spices. The palate is warming, with apple juice backed by a slowly growing spice note, later caramels, and a slight oxidized apple and brown peel note to end. The finish has a mildly bitter apple tinge and buzzing spices. The apple sings out with a dash of water. (494 bottles) £89",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
84,Bushmills Sherry Cask Reserve,40.0,Irish,85,"This first release in the Steamship Collection was matured in<em> oloroso</em> sherry butts and enticingly smells both oily and jammy. Dried fruits, such as cranberry, cherry, and raisin, with Brazil nut oil, wood spice, and light pepper. A soft dram, tasting of stewed apple, plum, cherry jelly, spiced orange, dark chocolate, and ending with spices, pepper, fading fruit, and carob nibs. It’s not all at sea, but just needs more body, especially mid-palate, to ride the waves of <em>oloroso</em> influence. (Travel Retail exclusive) £65",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
84,Brenne 10 year old 2015 Release,48.0,Single Malt French Whisky,120,"Brenne’s first age statement whisky, this was matured in virgin French Limousin oak and cognac barrels. It’s a fruit salad of nectarine, white grape juice, watermelon, and pear, with touches of light vanilla and black tea. A cool, clean sip delivers apple, pear, peach, and apricot, followed by an intense wave of citrus, Fruit Pastilles, spice, and orange butter icing. Those spices fade slowly; the residual flavors are fruity rather than sweet. Clear evidence that Brenne is improving all the time.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
84,Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Carsebridge) 50 year old 1965,,Single Grain Whisky,345,"This was distilled the year before Carsebridge joined Scottish Grain Distillers under Distillers Company Limited (DCL). It brings a nose of toasted muffins, whole lemon, light honey, vanilla, pencil shavings, and a slight herbal hit. Smooth, thick, and viscous, with light lemon, honey, gentle spices, peach melba, and toffee. The finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant. A venerable, pleasant old grain, but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive. (101 bottles) £267",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
84,"Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice 1999 (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory)",46.0,Single Malt Scotch,78,"This peated expression from Tobermory distillery has been aged in refill, remade hogsheads. The nose offers earthy peat, citrus fruit, vanilla, and smoked haddock in butter. Big, sweet peat notes on the peppery palate, with marshmallows and lively spices. The spices linger to the close, with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips. £60",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
84,Two James Spirits Catcher’s Rye,,Craft Whiskey,60,"Cereal grains, flour-dusted breadboard, fresh cut hay, horehound lozenge, and apple pie. The appearance of Fig Newtons cookie and toasted rye bread flavors nicely complements green peppercorn spice and an herb garden edge, with good length to the salted-caramel and sweet maple finish. Pot distilled from 100% Michigan rye and aged in full-sized barrels. It’s just a touch green, but drinking nicely and totally on track. More patience will pay dividends.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
84,Barrell American Whiskey (Batch 002),,American Whiskey (Unspecified),65,"Two things show almost immediately: alcohol level and sherry cask. Heat and salty nuttiness really express themselves early on, eventually followed by flavors of caramel chew, graham cracker, nutmeg, and cinnamon, with an unwanted bitterness. Walnut shell and smoked meat come along too, for a medium finish that tingles. With a drop of water, its bitterness turns to oak, making it the preferred way to sip its hefty proof. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
84,John Myer New York Straight Wheat Single Barrel,45.0,Craft Whiskey,42,"Soft and sweet; ripe apricot, honeyed porridge, and sweet vanilla take the lead, with a palate that elicits warm peach cobbler sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. There is lots of freshly-sawn oak apparent throughout, but ample fruit keeps this whiskey juicy right through a pleasantly spicy finish. Fruit forward, smooth, and lovely; a real eye-opener for a whiskey of 100% soft white winter wheat. 375ml",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
84,Whisky Castle Vintage (Cask 485),43.0,Swiss,92,"Ruedi Käser has made Whisky Castle one of the best-known Swiss whiskies, and he actively experiments with different grains and cask types. This single-cask expression was produced from corn and 20% peated malt. Herbal notes, fruit jelly on toast, dry oak, cinnamon, warm toasty spices, and a little smoke. A nice silky texture; red fruits, apple, plum, ground ginger, and peppercorn. Pleasant sweetness to begin, then a growing bitterness decaying to a dry and spicy finish. CHF89",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
84,Kilchoman Sanaig,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"A new, and welcome, permanent member of the core Kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, Kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
84,New Holland Cask & Smoke Whiskey,45.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Peat-smoked American malt whiskey. Nose isn’t so much peaty-smoky as it is sweet and husky; like cocoa bean mulch that’s been rained on a few times. The smoke’s there on the tongue, though, beautifully restrained, light and sweet. For small-barrel whiskey, this is surprisingly subtle, and the dance of the smoke is enticing. The oak’s a bit sharp though, and clamps on the finish; points off there. Promising.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
84,Nant Bourbon Cask,43.0,Australian Whisky,119,"The Nant estate is self-sufficient for about a third of the barley it needs to make its Tasmanian Highland malt whisky. Nosing reveals a lemon tree, light summer fruits of melon, lychee, and grape, floral honey, barley, sliced almond, fragrant vanilla, and a powdering of spices. Well-structured and full bodied, there is blossom honey, baked lemon, Murray mints, fresh water mint, green fruits, and sweet vanilla. It slips down beautifully, coating the mouth, leaving light spice and dark sugar. A$165",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
84,The English Whisky Co. Classic,,Single Malt English Whisky,87,"A marvelous red British telephone box adorns the label. A nose of pulped lemon and lime, pineapple, hard candy, and Bramley applesauce certainly makes this a fruit-led proposition. It caresses the tongue with soft, boiled apples and lemon cake flavors, marking a crescendo in the perception of its strength; peaking with tropical fruits and touches of acidity pinching in from the periphery. Spicy heat, icing sugars, fig paste, and hints of bitterness round off the finish. (270 bottles,<em> The Whisky Exchange only</em>) £60",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
84,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 25 year old 1989,,Single Grain Whisky,117,"From the most westerly grain distillery in Scotland comes this wee charmer, offering coconut fondant, galia melon, fresh cream, and a pleasing, fragrant foliage note (walking through dense reed beds in early summer). A big, juicy dram with citrus, tropical fruits, and dabs of white pepper heat. The creaminess builds as dilution occurs, then it reaches a natural plateau and hits cruise. An intensely tangy and long finish of dried fruits. (232 bottles) £81",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
84,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at North British) 27 year old 1988,,Single Grain Whisky,122,"Drawn from a single refill barrel, the nose is like a day in the life of a honeybee: streams of pollen, rich nectar, heady scents of flying over bright summer flowers and summer picnics of white peaches and lemonade before returning to the hive to the sweet, sticky honey. It’s quite a buzz! There’s an acidic palate of lemon juice, lime, honey, and lemon pith bordering on bitterness. The finish is incredibly dry, like someone just invented lemon-scented sandpaper. (168 bottles) £85",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
84,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1987,,Single Grain Whisky,124,"Creamy vanilla, fresh-cut grass, gentle herbal notes, Murray mints, and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast (in a lovely, comforting way). The cereals provide a sweet biscuit note, butterscotch candy, gingersnaps, and a nip of aniseed. The outturn of cask #10804, its taste develops with dried orange peel, cookie dough, and vanilla. Quite scrumptious! Fading slowly, it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn. (198 bottles) £86",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
84,Port Charlotte 2007 CC:01,,Single Malt Scotch,98,"An immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal (tepeztate to be precise), and it is this green, celery-accented element playing off some oily, nutty, and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue. Water reveals its youth, but there’s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate, where the natural sweet spirit shows itself. Keenly priced. Worth a look next time you are flying. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>) £68",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
84,Greenbar Slow Hand Six Woods,42.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"100% malt whiskey, aged “to taste” in white oak vats (1,000-2,000 gallons!), on toasted cubes of hickory, maple, mulberry, red oak, and grape wood. Pleasantly fruity nose with a firm oak backboard. Malt is dominant on the tongue, a bit shallow, but the woods contribute a bubbling complexity. Unfortunately, things don’t really come together in the finish, but the experiment’s not a loss, given the interesting effects of the multiple woods. Worth a taste.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
84,A.D. Laws Four Grain Straight Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,65,"A mashbill of 60/20/10/10 corn/wheat/rye/malt, aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Nose is sweet, hot corn, but with an initial puff of sulfur; where’s that from? Interesting splash in the mouth, with smooth wheat character knocking back the rye spice. Fairly hot, with some clove/cinnamon spice amping up as it winds down to the warm finish. Very active whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
84,Aberfeldy 16 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Aberfeldy distillery has added a 16 year old expression to its core range, positioned between the existing 12 and 21 year old variants. This newcomer has been finished in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks, and the result is a pleasing if undemanding dram with a fresh, sweet, sherried nose, featuring orange, honey, and ginger. Smooth on the palate, with more oranges, marzipan, then milk chocolate and gentle spices. Nutty spice, increasingly bitter orange, and dark chocolate in the finish. £62",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
84,The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1997 17 year old (Cask #5365),,Single Malt Scotch,,"The mix of honey, citrus, fruit, and malt which sits at Balvenie’s core is beginning to deepen. The citrus fruits, for example, are becoming concentrated, the honey is set clover, the fruits moving into cooked apricot and banana. Rounded and thick in the mouth, where the honeyed aspects and fleshiness of the fruits take control, before a bloom of bridal bouquet. Tremendously complex, here’s Balvenie&#039;s flowering into mid-period maturity. The price is…scary! £700",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
84,Bowmore The Devil’s Casks III,,Single Malt Scotch,274,"Sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in <em>oloroso</em> and PX and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is <em>sotto voce</em>. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there’s a bitterness on the end, that’s a minor cavil. £190",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
84,Koval Single Barrel Four Grain (Barrel 897),47.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Oat, malt, rye, and wheat are the four organic grains (like you, I was instantly curious); nice amber color. Hot and sweet (with a hint of dill) on the nose, rafting in on a thick oak plank. Sweet grain, cut wood, and lingering heat make this good, but I&#039;m looking for more complexity. There&#039;s no clear handle to this one, no “I&#039;m bourbon,” or “I&#039;m malt,” which is intriguing, but it&#039;s just...good, not inspiring. Odd complaint, but there you are.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
84,Port Dundas 18 year old,43.0,Single Grain Whisky,100,"This is a little darker in color than its younger counterpart <em>(see below)</em>, although it is achieved without the complex recipe of different cask maturation that characterized the 2011 Special Releases bottling. Weetabix, hazelnut shells, and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass. It’s a soft, silky, wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory. Imagine a molten toffee crisp, if you like. A nougat and walnut-whip finish. Distinctively different.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
84,Wyoming Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel #1447),44.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Nose is mild, pleasant, sweet, with rock candy, cinnamon, and baked apple. Follow-through on the palate is almost exact: mild, pleasant, sweet, with rock candy, etc., plus a nice bit of extra alcohol heat and quiet oak shaping the finish. A mild-mannered bourbon, which I feel is like a mild-mannered rodeo bull; out of place. There&#039;s nothing wrong, but it&#039;s a bit too easy-drinking, too mild. Bulk up.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
84,Spirit Works Straight Wheat,45.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Made from 100% organic red winter wheat, aged 2 years, 1 month. Much lighter on the nose than its rye stablemate <em>(see above)</em>; notes of butterscotch and green tea, with a bit of oaky strength. Flavors of cracked grain and light stone fruits shimmer across the tongue; the oak stays high in the mouth. Finish is light and long, moving from grain to wood at the end. Interesting and delicate for a 2 year old.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
84,Rowhouse Spirits Poitin,48.0,Craft Whiskey,28,"100% pilsner malt fermented with Belgian ale yeast. Not unaged whiskey; a grain spirit meant to be drunk without aging. Sweet-tart, intense aroma of unripe cherries, plums, white pepper, and a bit of caramel. Smooth on the tongue with a roll of heat, grain comes forward and dominates the fruit, though it balances at the finish. Clean, even interesting. More <em>poitin</em> should be like this. (<em>Pennsylvania and New Jersey only)</em>",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
84,Teerenpeli Distiller’s Choice Rasi,43.0,Single Malt Finnish Whisky,87,"A Moscatel finish for a year after maturation in bourbon casks has added dark, sweet notes to the whisky’s natural character. This has an attractive nose of red-skinned apples, sweet dark raisins, coconut, nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. The creamy texture has well-balanced flavors of tangy tropical fruit, Szechuan peppercorns, and a dalliance with citrus. Light, clean, and refreshing through to the finish of spiced apple and pepper. Subtle and careful, this is a restrained example of extra maturation. (2,554 bottles) £60",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
84,Parker’s Heritage Collection Kentucky Straight Malt Whiskey 8 year old,54.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),100,"A rarity among the large American distillers: whiskey with a mashbill of 65% malted barley and 35% corn; no rye or wheat. The malted barley and corn dominate the flavor profile, along with soft sweet notes of orchard fruit and golden raisin, kissed with honey. The finish is soft, sweet, and quick. Clean, with an easy-going demeanor. Not particularly complex, however. If only the 35% corn was halved to include an equal amount of rye.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
84,Dalwhinnie Winter’s Gold,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"Distilled between October and March, matured in American (first-fill and refill) and European oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. From the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate. The finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
84,Tomatin Contrasting Casks Bourbon Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,152,"The bourbon cask-matured partner to the Sherry Matured bottling <em>(see above)</em>, this expression similarly comprises a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. Both Contrasting Casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. Apple pie, with buttery caramel, milk chocolate, and coconut on the nose. Zesty spices on the early palate, then custard, contrasting lemon, and a note of char. Spicy fruits, black pepper, and more char in the finish. £100",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
84,Ichiro’s Malt Peated (distilled at Chichibu),,Japanese,145,"Distilled 2011, bottled 2015. A warming, cozy, campfire of a nose, with everyone swathed in blankets as some hickory bursts into flames. There’s also an iris-like floral note and a vegetal thing at the back. With water, a nuance of cereal and wet dog. The palate moves into a rich, oily texture, then pulls back into hot embers of scented wood, and raspberry. The smoke is all-pervading, scented but sweet. Water brings out peppermint and smoky bacon. Hugely impressive for a 4 year old. £95",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
84,Jim Beam Harvest Collection Six Row Barley,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"A toasty nose with bright citrus, spice, and oaky vanilla; you can feel the heat. Clearly Beam, but just as clearly different; there’s a flat spread to this, and a dry pull on the tongue and in the finish. Six-row barley has more husk to it, which can add tannins to beer; is there enough here to make a difference? It’s an interesting character, but it’s not all good. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Sweet fresh corn and fruit—apple skins, white grapes, dried apricot—tangle with spicy cinnamon and circus peanuts. Quite smooth indeed, especially at 50%. Light toasted corn, like corn flakes cereal, with the spice and fruit leading to a subtly layered finish (oak, fruit, a bit of milk chocolate). A late-morning bourbon, easy and friendly.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,Cedar Ridge Single Malt,40.0,Craft Whiskey,48,"Hot tropical fruit, warm band-aids, and a mix of Dum-Dum lollipops in the nose. More sweet and creamy on the palate, with a hint of the band-aids, and dry grip of oak at the end. A fairly quick drink, but a clean and layered one.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,Cedar Ridge Wheat,40.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"Distilled from 100% white winter wheat; pale straw. Salty dough and sweet, light canned fruit. Like grain whisky on the tongue: light, sweet, delicate, more fruit cocktail, and a hint of milk chocolate. A smooth and pleasant finish. Simple but delightful.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,MacPhail’s Collection (distilled at Glenturret) 2000,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"This 2000 vintage expression from Glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of Gordon &amp; MacPhail’s “MacPhail’s Collection” range. The nose is earthy, with vanilla, treacle, and dark berries, plus fruit spices. Full-bodied in the mouth, with spicy, zesty plums, raisins, cocktail cherries, and nutmeg. The finish is lengthy, with black treacle, cocoa powder, and an edge of slightly bitter oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
84,Wigle Straight Wheat,,Craft Whiskey,62,"Wigle’s proud to have a full 2 years of age on this organic wheat whiskey. It’s small-barrel dark, but the nose isn’t a ripper: it’s 100 proof hot, but sweet with grain and even light fruity notes (pear and ripe melon). There’s no denying it’s aggressive, especially for a wheat whiskey, but the small-barrel oak blends well with the grain, giving a robust set of flavors: oak, hard candies, grilled fruit. A bit loud, a bit pushy, but endearing.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 1984,,Single Malt Scotch,400,"Surprisingly punchy for its age, there’s very little cask activity here, so what you get is a reduction of Caol Ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. The palate is gentle and shy, with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. Delicate, but also oozing with character. Best neat.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
84,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glentauchers) 1989,,Single Malt Scotch,275,"This example of the little-seen Glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character, which is in the green grassy camp. This verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad, with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask. This mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue, although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate. I’d happily have a couple.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
84,Sonoma County Cherrywood Rye (batch 1),48.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"A 1 year old whiskey made from rye, wheat, and cherrywood-smoked malt. An interesting sweet/sour nose, with Montmorency cherry, sweet grain, bitter rye, and a slap of fresh leather jacket. Follows through in the mouth, but more integrated, a sweet cocktail of neat whiskey with only the slightest hint of “smoke.” The leather slips in at the finish and wraps things up neatly. A bit overly sweet, a bit simple, but good.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,Sonoma County Cask Strength Rye,,Craft Whiskey,65,"100% rye, unmalted and malted, direct-fire pot stilled, “old wood finished”: a detailed label, but no age statement or “straight.” Peppery, minty nose with a fleeting hint of coal smoke, lots of heat. Fierce rye flavor, hot and sweet, and then a fantastic finish that curls and flexes: sweet, oily, hot, pepper, and small barrel oak. The rest of it’s okay, but that finish is a marvelous ride.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,J.J. Renfield & Sons 8 year old,40.0,Canadian,25,"A surprisingly tasty “buyers own brand” of unknown origin. Its lush, fruity, caramel-rich nose foreshadows a sweet, mouth-coating luxury. Baskets of orchard fruits and bowls of stewed fruit are accented by cinnamon, mild ginger root, and spicy white pepper. The round, syrupy mouth feel carries right into a creamy but gently bitter, glowing hot finish. Meticulously well-balanced and the very definition of smooth.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
84,Flóki Young Malt,47.0,Icelandic Whisky and Malt Spirit,61,"Labeled “young malt” because it is only about 18 months old. Distilled from Icelandic-grown malted barley as a whole mash (not a filtered wash) in a pot still, it has a nice husky, cocoa hull note in the sweet, somewhat hot malt nose. Full mouthfeel, rich grain character, dry cocoa hulls, and just before the dusty malt finish there’s an eye-opening wash of sweetness. Good potential, and an interesting character. <em>(Travel Retail in Iceland only) </em>ISK 7,950/500 ml",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
84,Aberlour A’Bunadh (batch 50),,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Very sweet, with thick hard toffee, stewing dates and figs, molasses, and rum raisin ice cream, before some dark chocolate, dried mint, and orange peel. The palate is a different beast. It ignites on the tongue with a burst of dried pepper flakes, beneath which are cocktail bitters: gentian calamus. It begs for water, when out comes black currant jam (very Aberlour) and a little malt. Now it’s calm and hugely drinkable, and therefore even more dangerous.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
84,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Arran) 2006,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"Bottled in 2015, this expression from Arran distillery was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Ripe apple and tinned peaches on the early nose, icing sugar, a hint of mint, and soft toffee. Lively spices and pear drops on the palate, with vanilla and cocoa. The finish is medium in length, with a twist of lemon and cocoa powder.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
84,Hart Brothers 11 year old (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,78,"There have been some legendary Hart Brothers bottlings of Bowmore (the 1966 bottled in ’74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. The nose is creamy and discreet, but Bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. Here you get seashells and low-tide aromas, along with green banana. The palate is gently smoked with light barley, cool melon. An afternoon dram. £50",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
84,Glen Scotia Double Cask,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"This relatively youthful whisky was matured in bourbon barrels, before a period in <em>Pedro Ximénez</em> sherry casks. Sweet, red berry notes on the nose, with slightly smoky vanilla and caramel. Voluptuous in the mouth, with spicy, rich sherry notes, sultanas, and ginger. Spicy sea salt and lingering sherry in the finish. £37",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
84,Laphroaig 15 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Brought back as a celebration of the distillery’s 200th anniversary and, in the vein of other 15 year old expressions, is somewhat restrained. Rather than big phenols there’s an aroma of lanolin, sautéed scallop, fleshy fruit, and real sweetness. The palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote, but this is a tea party rather than a wild <em>ceilidh</em>. Maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that’s missing.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
84,The Antiquary 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,27,"Thick, viscous golden syrup, digestive biscuits, and Almond Joy bars underpin some soft, peaty aromas. It’s rather an appealing combination. Satin smooth on the tongue, with lemon, lime, orange, and dried pineapple, but enough malt to keep things interesting. The finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. For the few extra bucks, the more mature component whiskies make for a richer, fuller, and more satisfying experience than The Antiquary’s red-labeled bottle.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
84,Douglas Laing Single Minded Speyside 24 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,125,"Huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. This then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment, then lychee and some maltiness. The palate is surprisingly feisty, with a little orange. Water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. When diluted, the palate is very pretty, with the almond returning. Easy drinking. £80",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
84,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenallachie) 6 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,84,"Another blast of new oak. Fat and creamy, with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple, banana fritters, white chocolate, suntan oil, and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate. An instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age. With water, some of the distillery finally pokes through. To be honest, it’s slightly too much for me; like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donuts. £54",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
84,Rebel Yell Small Batch,45.0,Rye Whiskey,30,"“Aged 24 months.” In these debased times, they should be applauded for the correct labeling of this 2 year old. Somewhat hot nose of grass, cinnamon, Pixy Stix powder candy, and oak. Simple, sweet on the palate with a crisping of rye bitterness and oak. Easy-drinking and not overly young. Color me surprised: it’s well-made for inexpensive young rye.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
84,Goldlys 14 year old Manzanilla Finish (cask 2629),43.0,Belgian Whisky,41,"Other than detecting a note of burst balloons, I enjoyed a warm, rich, comforting nose of nutmeg-sprinkled apple pie, raspberry jam, stewed plums, allspice, and prunes on this whisky distilled at the famous jenever powerhouse of Filliers. A lightweight citrus nose, with vanilla tablet, stewed fruits, watermelon, and a fusty, grained texture. This settles down nicely with a few drops of water for a short finish of light toffee and hints of cocoa. €38",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
84,Talisker Skye,,Single Malt Scotch,48,"The latest release from Talisker is an NAS bottling which contains whisky matured in toasted and refill American oak casks. According to the distiller, this is “An easy-drinking Talisker…more approachable, but still definitely Talisker.” Certainly approachable on the nose, with tangerines, honey, and milk chocolate, before ozone and peat smoke develop. Ginger and a hint of coal tar. Medium-bodied, with citrus fruit and increasingly hot spices, though never overwhelming. Spicy peat, white pepper, and aniseed in a nutty finish. £33",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
84,Tomatin 12 year old French Oak Finish,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Exclusive to North America, this bottling was matured in bourbon hogsheads for 9 years, and then finished in French oak casks for a further 3 years. The casks originally contained red wine from the Bacalhoa winery. Before use by Tomatin they underwent a de-char/re-char process. Peaches, vanilla, milk chocolate, and ginger on the nutty nose, with new-mown hay. Full-bodied, with toffee apples, black pepper, and cloves. Lingering warm spices in the finish. (12,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
84,Tomatin,,Single Malt Scotch,81,"This NAS cask strength expression of Tomatin was matured in a mix of bourbon and virgin American oak casks. The nose is sweet and fragrant, with vanilla, cinnamon, and developing coconut ice. Silky on the palate initially, softly spiced, with vanilla toffee, pears, and apples; then the spices intensify, introducing a hint of chili. Drying in the lengthy, spicy, slightly herbal finish. <em>(282 bottles; exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) </em>£55",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
84,Millstone 2004 Barrel Proof Rye 10 year old (cask #667),,Dutch,125,"Hard toffee, Brazil nut, milk chocolate, and noticeable rye bread aromas on the nose from this new American oak barrel. The rye spiciness is embedded with the other flavors; balanced, but not dominant. Soft and fudgey flavors display sparkling spices, deeper toffee notes, vanilla, and cinnamon bark. Try a dash of water to unlock the sweetness and citrus elements below the surface. If anything, this accentuates the tobacco and spiciness of the finish (<em>The Whisky Exchange only</em>) £85",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
84,Paul John Classic Select Cask,,Indian Whisky,92,"Sticky, spiced-coconut desserts, grapefruit, clove, allspice, and crispy bacon on the nose of this NAS whisky matured in bourbon casks. Sharp with lime, grapefruit, and lemon zest that settle down to green fruits, Jell-O, and dry spices. Do dilute, as water lets the spices leap from the glass, strips down the acidic attack, and accentuates the fresh apple and cinnamon. It doesn’t need much water, but it’s eminently better with a dash. £63",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
84,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Caol Ila) 6 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila, all elbows and knees. There is sweetness, but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
84,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Strathclyde) 26 year old 1988 (cask #62016),,Single Grain Whisky,180,"An uncommon 26 year Lowland single grain whisky made from wheat and aged in refill bourbon casks. Oak is quite present on the nose, but it&#039;s not alone: there&#039;s also bright citrus, pine, and white cake. The opening is softer with vanilla and apricot, but it&#039;s only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper. There is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol, which drives a very spicy and dry finish. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
84,Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Tormore) 1988,,Single Malt Scotch,183,"Full gold. Good cask interaction here, allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. Juicy and sweet, in other words, with none of the usual Tormore rigidity. The palate is equally concentrated, showing some heat, with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. Water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken, hayloft. It begins to firm up, but it is good enough to change folks’ minds about this distillery. £125",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
84,Glen Turner Heritage Double Wood,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,20,"It’s Double Wood, Jim, but not as we know it. Here, the blend has been given a Madeira finish, presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar, golden raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hazelnut. The blend has a creamy texture, with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel, mango, and dried pineapple, leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. Wood spices, nuttiness, and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. The extra Madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
84,Cadenhead’s Potter’s Indian Corn 24 year old Bourbon Barrel,,Canadian,110,"Although much praised, Potter’s was a mythical distillery. It had no still, but sold whisky purchased from others. This straightforward all-corn whisky shows dusty corncobs on the nose, with sweet and sour sauce, caramel, oak, cinnamon bark, and intriguing hints of pine needles. The palate is broader, beginning with a very sweet and zesty spicy rush, followed by sweet wood, a syrupy mouthfeel tasting of prune, dark ripe fruits, and sour citrus notes. <em>(126 bottles; UK only) </em>£75",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
84,Glendalough Aged 7 years,46.0,Irish,45,"Glendalough’s hook is the Wicklow water used to cut this whiskey. Sweet fruits, tubby satsumas, lime, and passion fruit backed by ground ginger, star anise, and some earthy background notes from the bourbon casks. Tangy orange crystallized fruits predominate, pierced with pepper, root ginger, and soda pop. The mouthfeel is light and uncomplicated, but provides a solid delivery of tasty flavors from start to the snappy, spicy finish. A great introduction.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
84,Komogatake The Revival 2011,57.0,Japanese,161,"Aged in a mix of sherry and American oak casks, this is the latest work in progress from the reopened Mars distillery. The nose is a little closed, with some light oak, a touch of smoke, some fresh barley, and light fruit over the sweet core typical of the distillery. Just a touch of plastic, indicative of youth. The palate is immediate, and bursting with sweetness, exotic fruits, and clean acidity. Welcome back, Mars! £110",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
84,Arran Machrie Moor Cask Strength (Batch 1),,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Arran first introduced its peated Machrie Moor variant some five years ago; since then it has become a firm favorite. Late 2014 saw the appearance of the first cask strength edition of Machrie Moor, limited to 6,000 bottles. Wood smoke, warm tar, and emerging new leather on the bold nose. Sweet peat and spices on the palate, barbecue sauce, and black pepper. Long in the finish: vanilla, with sweet smoke and chili.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
84,The Balvenie Single Barrel Sherry Cask 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Big sherry influence immediately, with walnut skin, raisin bread, and mixed peels. Seems pretty dry, and the malty undertow here is whole grain bread. Balvenie’s signature sweetness comes across like soft brown Demerara sugar before it shifts into forest floor, mulch, nut, and dried berries. Just enough residual sweetness to keep the tannins at bay. Water makes it more woody, with burlap, cacao, a little earthiness, and a slightly bitter exit.",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
84,Glenmorangie Dornoch Limited Edition,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"This bottling of Glenmorangie has been released to raise awareness of marine conservation. A proportion of the whisky has been finished in <em>amontillado</em> sherry butts. The nose offers honey, vanilla, peaches, toffee bonbons, wood lacquer, sherry, and a hint of peat. Soft and elegant on the palate, with fruity spice, nutty toffee, more sherry, and sweet smoke. Slightly smoky in the finish, with soft oak, citrus fruit, and aniseed. <em>(Travel Retail only) </em>£60",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
84,Glenmorangie Taghta,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,99,"Taghta—Gaelic for “Chosen One”—is the result of Glenmorangie’s innovative Cask Masters program, in which crowd-sourcing strongly influenced the final release. It is non-chill filtered and has been finished in <em>manzanilla</em> sherry casks. Fragrant, slightly salty, fruity sherry notes, sweet spices on the nose. New leather and lots of spice on the palate, with olives, rock salt, and a suggestion of red wine. Medium in length, drying, with licorice and black pepper. (12,000 bottles) £65",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
84,Wemyss Malts Cayenne Cocoa Bean 1997 (distilled at Clynelish),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,104,"One of two single cask bottlings of 17 year old Clynelish released by Wemyss Malts in the fall of 2014. The hogshead provided 373 bottles. Pineapple and nectarines on the nose, with salted caramel. Mildly herbal. The palate is rich and viscous, with a sprinkling of pepper over sliced red apples, sweet spices, vanilla, and hazelnuts. Lingering in the finish, with lemon; nutty and lightly oaked. £68",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
84,Wemyss Malts Velvet Fig,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,61,"Who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks? They’ve perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate, cocoa, biscuit, raisin, dried dates, and walnut are all here. Sipping brings on chocolate, coffee, malt, ginger, nutmeg, and dried fig. There’s no slow reveal, it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors, they extinguish one, by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6,000 bottles) £40",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
84,Armorik Maitre de Chai,,French Whisky,66,"Seaweed piled in a beach bonfire, Keemun tea, hide-covered tomes, and toffee apples. Soupy, salty smoke without the heat on this dram, which was matured for 6 years in first-fill <em>oloroso</em>. The flavors bring an array of apple peelings, cough sweets, aniseed, and roasted sesame seed before developing some savory elements of roast pork. A spicy tingle takes you through to the finish. Water coaxes out apple jelly and pear notes. (1,000 bottles) €58",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
84,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Craigellachie) 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,123,"Amber. A thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness. Has some substance and weight and the heavy florals (lily, jasmine) typical of mature Craig, alongside toffee. The palate is ripe, juicy, and full, the cask adding a slight resinous edge. Appears slightly smoky. Becomes fleshy, even waxy, with water, and decidedly more elegant. The tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge. It is at its best neat, or with water on the side. £80",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
84,"Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Deanston, Cask 10,426) 1994",,Single Malt Scotch,133,"Distilled in June 1994, this example of Deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt, which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. Quite shy on the nose, a hint of starch, gentle malt, and ginger. Shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet, with peaches and over-ripe apricots. Softly spiced. The finish is lengthy and sweet, with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
84,Wigle Organic Wheat,46.0,Craft Whiskey,46,"There&#039;s big oak, caramel, cinnamon and clove spice, and fresh grain in the nose; not a shy, soft wheat whiskey at all. Good body, supporting spiciness, mint, and young oak; the small barrel punches, tempered by sweet grain and spice. Finish gets a bit dusty and astringent, crimping things. Wood-balanced, not dominated by it. Bold, dynamic.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
84,Syndicate 58/6 Premium,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,160,"An odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix. The blend is then finished for four years in <em>oloroso</em> casks. It&#039;s a bit of blending gymnastics. Very sherry influenced, with marionberry jam, malt, salt, and oak. The integration and flavors are nice, but it all feels a bit muted. A medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
84,Label 5 Gold Heritage,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,45,"Master blender Graham Coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the Label 5 range. Vanilla, dark fruit, and gentle spices on the nose, but the appeal lies in the beautiful, clingy mouthfeel. Warm marmalade, nuts, and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy, smooth dram. It builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives. The finish is drying with dampened-down spices. €40",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
84,Kings County Peated Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Now that’s something you don’t see every day. Kings County (Brooklyn, N.Y.) used peat-smoked malt in this bourbon. The nose is bonfire and sweet juicy corn; the undiscovered Hebridean Isle of Kentucky? The smoke is less forward on the tongue; you don’t get so much a peaty bourbon as you get an unusually rich, broad young bourbon. More warming corn, digestive biscuits, and a pleasantly hot finish. Compelling, and…what kind of Manhattan would this make? <em>(400 bottles; at the distillery only) </em>Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
84,Benrinnes 21 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,400,"Meaty, beaty, big, but only slightly bouncy. The nose is initially reminiscent of curried mutton with an added heathery earthiness and some distillery sulfur. It then dries into biltong/pemmican with some faint barley notes behind. The water adds a note of fresh coriander. Massive in the mouth, with raisin, roasting tins. It’s a relief when water releases some surprisingly soft treacle toffee sweetness, but it’s not quite enough to balance the massive meaty assault. (2,892 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
84,Highland Park Dark Origins,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Dark Origins is a new addition to Highland Park’s core range, inspired by the distillery’s founder, Magnus Eunson. The recipe embraces twice as many first-fill sherry casks than that of Highland Park 12 year old. Chocolate malt, caramel, and ripe bananas on the nose, with a whiff of coal dust. Silky on the palate, with dry sherry, autumn berries, plus more coal and a spicy, plain chocolate edge. Long and dry in the smoky finish, with black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
84,Cuatro Series Fino,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"The nose is nutty and earthy, with dry sherry, cooking apples, vanilla, and emerging icing sugar. Finally, a hint of sea salt. Silky in the mouth, with lively spices, Jaffa oranges, muted sherry, and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with spice and persistent citrus fruit.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
84,"Kilchoman Single Cask Release Cask #370 (distilled 2008, bottled 2014)",,Single Malt Scotch,95,"An uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (<em>Wyoming only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
84,Benjamin Prichard&#039;s Sweet Lucy Bourbon Cream Liqueur,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,25,"More widely available than Buffalo Trace’s adored Bourbon Cream, Prichard’s takes premium cream from Wisconsin and adds it to their Sweet Lucy liqueur. The nose is sweet but not overly so, with orange creamsicle and just a hint of whiskey with oak spice. On the palate it’s creamy confection bliss, with ladyfingers covered in heavy cream and candied orange topped with a drizzle of bourbon. Rich, creamy, but not too heavy; file this one as a dangerously delicious guilty pleasure.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
84,Berkshire Mountain Terrapin Finished Bourbon,43.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Another from a series of beer barrel-finished bourbons from this Massachusetts distiller; this one’s from a Terrapin Brewing’s Monk’s Revenge Belgian IPA barrel. Nose is fruity and sweet, with an undertone of linen and old iron. There is the bitter and faintly piney edge of hops in the whiskey, which adds a cutting grip to the finish. Before that, there is spoonbread, oak, and a hint of anise. Interesting components, needs a bit more integration.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
84,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) Batch 1,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,76,"Custard creams, lemon peel, and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty Edinburgh grain distillery. The palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest, to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple, reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. Like a bulldog chewing a wasp, there’s lip-puckering sharpness throughout, though it’s judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. A great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles) £48",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
84,Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice 1996 (distilled at Tomatin),43.0,Single Malt English Whisky,91,"Gordon &amp; MacPhail’s 1996 Tomatin was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Malt, fruit fondant, black pepper, then late vanilla and fudge on the nose. Peaches and apricots on the palate, with vanilla and white pepper. The finish is spicy and medium in length, with lasting orchard fruits. £57",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
84,Braunstein Library Collection 13-1,46.0,Danish,133,"This is big, bruising, beautiful whisky. It even <em>feels</em> thick when you pour it. The dark, tawny liquid evokes mixed peel, rum, and raisin from the maturation in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. Tipping in a mouthful unleashes a slick of dark bramble and black currant flavors over the tongue; chewy and weighty with thick tannins, it develops with burnished oak, fig, gingerbread, and dark spices, achieving a bitter riposte before it finally pitches over the back of the throat into oblivion. 795kr",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
84,66Gilead Crimson Rye,47.0,Canadian,69,"The second whisky from this Canadian craft distillery is a blend of three barrels of 100 percent rye whisky. Maturation for 3½ years in once-used red wine barrels has integrated distinct ripe fruits into the spiciness of rye grain. Youth is obvious in the earthy, malty elements, and the peppery heat, and there are distinct suggestions of clean blue clay. Its full body, rich flavors, and the fruit-spice balance speak well for the future of whisky from 66Gilead. <em>(Canada only)</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2014
84,Strathmill 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,475,"Light gold. Fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups, green grape, lime (or green) jelly babies, and Quetsch, with that nut flour underneath. The palate is similarly smooth, creamy, and upfront, with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. A soft, delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2,700 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
84,Highland Queen 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,76,"At this age, there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old. Behind the <em>tarte tatin</em>, butterscotch, light pepper, and wood spice is a green, verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist. It has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch, strawberry, and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core. When the fruit flavor withers, there is a drop off in flavor, leaving a malty melee. £48",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
84,Twelve Five Rye,,Craft Whiskey,50,"Nose of sweet dried grass and cinnamon, echoed on the palate with supports of sweet, oaky vanilla. The finish develops some doughiness, then finally an oaky spice heat that lingers pleasantly, the most interesting part of the dram. Well-made (at Cedar Ridge, in Iowa) and clean, if not exceptionally complex. A good flask whiskey for a hike. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
84,Cadenhead Authentic Collection 28 year old (distilled at Highland Park),,Single Malt Scotch,191,"Distilled in 1985, this expression of Highland Park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. Green apples, tinned mandarin oranges, linseed, and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. Sweet spices, coconut, and mild peat smoke on the light palate. Lingering peat smoke, root ginger, and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
84,Grant’s Signature,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,29,"Brian Kinsman’s new creation was inspired by their founder William Grant, with a remit to create a malty blend of character. Digestive biscuits, malt, honeycomb, and confectioner’s chocolate melted over a bain-marie. It’s a satisfyingly rich dram, well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution. Banoffee pie, caramel biscuits, and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses, leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee. (<em>UK and France only)</em> £18",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
84,Master of Malt Darkness! Benrinnes 15 year old Oloroso Cask Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,101,"What you look for in a finished whisky is for some of the distillery&#039;s character to be apparent, but also enhanced. Benrinnes is a big, meaty dram, which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. Think of roast beef with damson jam, date, and blackberry. The palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. It has power, and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish, it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
84,Ci6 Elements of Islay (distilled at Caol Ila),,Single Malt Scotch,101,"Pale straw. Delicate and a little akin to chilled <em>manzanilla</em> sherry: fresh almond, salinity, light yeast. Vibrant, with the smoke held in check. The palate is much sweeter, with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. Then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water, giving an effect like saltwater taffy. It needs water to flesh the palate out. £60/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
84,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glen Grant) 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,127,"The initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk, which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and, weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise, some smoke. The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. Intriguing! £75",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
84,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1983 (Cask #31),,Single Malt Scotch,724,"In style, this is closest to the 1978 in its levels of sweetness. Here, though, there is added key lime pie, juicy white peaches, and whipped cream alongside that deep Glenfarclas roasted ‘polished brass’ note. The medium-weight palate is pure and sweet with light orchard fruits. The most freshly acidic of the selection, with a hint of flowers on the very end. £430",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
84,Exclusive Malts 1993 (distilled at Glen Garioch),,Single Malt Scotch,140,"This 19 year old example of Glen Garioch from 1993 offers a nose of orange blossom, sherry, and milk chocolate, becoming sweeter with time. Finally, butterscotch mousse. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with cherries, icing sugar, and a hint of smoky caramel. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent citrus notes, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
84,Douglas Laing Old Particular 1996 (distilled at Highland Park),,Single Malt Scotch,151,"This 17 year old single cask (#10042) bottling of Highland Park was distilled in September 1996 and is presented non-chill filtered and with no added color in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular range. Baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose, while dark, smoky notes contrast with lighter, fruity flavors on the palate, along with a sprinkling of pepper. The finish dries, with more pepper, bonfire embers, and coffee grounds. £90",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
84,Adelphi (distilled at Longmorn) 1985,,Single Malt Scotch,320,"Plenty of the distillery’s fresh fruits, here with some Demerara sugar sprinkled on the top, a little hint of almond, peppermint, candied apple, and hard fruit sweets. The palate continues in the same vein, with some more apple (baked this time) and a chalky texture. Water allows it to become more creamy (think orange barley water), while a green fresh note emerges in the background. Just slightly bitter behind.",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
84,Master of Malt Secret Bottlings Series 8 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"Master of Malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends. The nose is inviting, with butter toffee, Bramley apples, fennel seeds, cut lawns, and chocolate-covered oat biscuits. It’s a pretty smooth proposition, serving up caramel maltiness, stewed apple, and orange and grapefruit pith, with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with. The ginger finish is zappy but short. A solid, everyday blend.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
84,Berkshire Samuel Adams Cask Finished Bourbon,43.0,Craft Whiskey,63,"One of a series of Berkshire bottlings done in barrels used to age craft beers; this one aged the massive (29%!) and complex Samuel Adams Utopias. The beer barrel adds a depth to Berkshire’s usually brighter character, a rounded and full sweetness with rum and fruit notes. There’s heat and youthful sweetness, and a pleasing fullness that grows toward the warming finish. A nice twist on the usual bottling. <em>(Massachusetts only)</em>",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
84,Wemyss Malts Lead on Macduff! 2002 (distilled at Macduff),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,96,"While most Wemyss Malts’ releases are named after flavor descriptors, this one adopts a well-known Shakespearean reference. A sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles. The nose offers toffee bonbons, coffee with condensed milk, and finally farmyard aromas. The palate is relatively sweet, with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit, plus a slight earthiness. The finish is medium to long, with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose. £57",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
84,Broger Medium Smoked,42.0,Austrian Whisky,64,"The key smoke characteristic here comes from kilning the barley over beechwood. The resultant aromas conjure up sweet mash, charcoal sticks, slabs of fish from the smoker, and dilapidated casks warming in the sunshine by the shoreline. It’s been matured for over 3 years in French Limousin oak, and the taste runs sweet with peach, nectarine, and melon, through Seville orange, to mixed peel and taffy candy. A finish of dried fruits, with lingering smoke in the tail. €48",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
84,J.W. Dant,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,13,"Bottle design looks like it came from a 1950s movie. Did bourbon smell like this then: cornbread and cinnamon, seasoned oak and a bare hint of cedar, sweet hot dough? Oily and lazy on the tongue, a pool of sweet corn fire, touched with the cinnamon. The wood is absent, but returns at the end with a grip on the tongue and palate. Another great whiskey for the money; great on the rocks, from a drawer in a private eye’s desk…",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
84,Silver Lightning Moonshine,,Craft Whiskey,40,"You wouldn’t believe from the nose on this white whiskey that it’s nearly 50% alcohol. Sweet, fresh-milled cornmeal combines with slightly acidic and floral pear, with just a dash of yeast to form an inviting and approachable nose. On the palate it’s equally affable and well-balanced, with sweet corn, crisp pear, and white pepper spice. A nice long finish with a touch of cooling rounds off an expertly-crafted and enjoyable moonshine.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
84,Ardbeg Auriverdes,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This year’s Ardbeg Day bottling is named in tribute to World Cup host Brazil’s national colors: Auri (Gold) and Verdes (Green). Very restrained to start: grassy, sweet with vanilla pod, shoreline, and smoke wrapped in a woolen blanket. The palate shows more smoke, light chocolate, Ardbeg oiliness, and soot. It’s fresh and charming, but ultimately is a quarterfinalist beaten on penalties.",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
84,Amrut Bourbon Single Cask #3441,60.0,Indian Whisky,100,"We can thank Bangalore’s climate for the arrival of this 2009 distillate. Honeycomb, vanilla shortbread, crispy tart shells, graham crackers, and malt extract make for an attractive proposition. It tiptoes onto the tongue, but within seconds you get the thundering sense of its full strength approaching. Dried fruits, wood spices, malt loaf, chewy caramels, shortbread biscuits, with Horlicks malted milk on the finish. A dash of water triggers a sensation of plump raspberries dipped in chocolate. £59",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
84,Sullivans Cove Double Cask,40.0,Australian Whisky,94,"This verdant Tasmanian whisky is the combined product of American oak and French oak port cask aging. You get waxy palm fronds, hazelnut shells, toasted spices, and celery tops laid over a groveside box wedged full of freshly-picked Florida oranges.Soft, honeyed, and gently spicy on the palate before the herbal and botanical notes overgrow it, leaving clove, pepper, and aniseed balls on the finish. Water cuts through the greenery to show lemon meringue pie with a grapefruit edge.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
84,McKenzie Rye,,Craft Whiskey,40,"From Finger Lakes distilling; one of two craft ryes I’m revisiting this issue. An interesting aroma of dry hay, dried fruit, and burlap that’s appealing to anyone who’s spent time on a farm. Smooth but not laid-back on the tongue, there’s plenty of good stuff going on here. Peppery rye, some soft fruit, that fresh burlap, and an urgent but not unwelcome heat. Maybe a little overdone on the fruit, but well-done overall.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
84,Chichibu The Peated 2013,,Japanese,235,"Can you get sweet peat? For that’s what we have here. Very fragrant, with delicate wood smoke mixing with citrus and roasted barley. When water is added, there’s a mossy note and the sweet warmth of cow’s breath. Continues in this vein in the mouth, with the peat now becoming like hot embers. Again, citric on the end, though more like Amalfi lemon with light bite. Very good. ¥24,000/700 ml",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
84,Spirit of Hven Seven Stars No. 1 Dubhe,45.0,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,124,"In the Straits of <em>Ø</em>resund, between Denmark and Sweden, sits the beautiful island of Hven. This is the first in a series of seven whiskies to mark the brightest stars of the Big Dipper asterism. Candied peel, walnut shells, warm marmalade, vanilla pods, and haylofts intermingle before Red Delicious apples shoulder in. It’s a lively, youthful dram of baked orange, milk chocolate, and vanilla tablet with a touch of pear. Best neat, as water subtracts from the experience. €90",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
84,Catskill Defiant Rye,,Craft Whiskey,35,"All four of these Catskill whiskeys are in exceptionally beautiful bottles. Pleasant, homey smell of furniture polish, dried mint and grass, golden syrup, and sweet dough, wrapped in a thin layer of oak. Brightly sweet, more mint and grass, some cashew richness, and an insistent singing thread of oak that broadens to the finish, where the sweet and the oak balance with a new note of melon. A bit of astringency at the end, but this is right decent whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
84,Broger Riebelmais,42.0,Austrian Whisky,66,"A few years ago, Broger branched out from <em>eau de vie</em> into whisky making in their Carl artisan still. This one is made from 100% Voralberg Riebel maize matured for four years before finishing in Sauternes casks from Château d’Yquem. There are pronounced sweet aromas, with kernels of cooked corn and potato scones. Fruity, clean-cut, and refreshing lemon sherbet and light butterscotch, but the sweetness is kept in check, even with a cream and sugar finish. A handsome introduction. €48",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
84,George Dickel White Corn Whisky No. 1,,White Whiskey,22,"“Mellow as moonlight” on the label; the old Cascade slogan, from the pre-Dickel branding days at Dickel. This is a throwback too; from before the barrel. The nose is full of sweet and fresh corn “cream” and cornbread, a nod to Dickel’s 84% corn mashbill. Some peppery notes join it on the palate, but that corn sweetness follows all the way to the end. One of the best white whiskeys I’ve tasted, and not overpriced.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
84,Michter’s US*1 Unblended American Whiskey (2013 release),,American Whiskey (Unspecified),43,"Off-market for two years. Nose of caramel, sugar wafers, and a touch of just-ripe nectarine. Sweet/smooth in the mouth, with sweet mint, rock candy, and gliding King syrup flavors slipping all over the tongue, while oak notes provide high spiciness. Finishes with a lingering light sweetness, like a dissolving sugar flake. With all the sweetness, though, it doesn’t cloy. Nice, if not complex.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
84,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Tormore) 1988,,Single Malt Scotch,150,"There’s something rather round peg in a square hole about Tormore, that grand urban palace of a distillery in wildest Speyside. The whisky, sadly, is often the same. Here, though, things look promising to start with: rice crackers, and a spicy, rye-like hardness on top of a vanilla-accented, sweet trail mix of a nose with some earthiness behind. The palate, for me, is still too rigid. For all its efforts to relax, this Tormore remains tense. £90",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
84,Dad’s Hat Rye Finished in Vermouth Barrels,47.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"A young (“minimum of 6 months”) rye, finished in California vermouth barrels. The results are polarizing; I’m in the “intriguingly tasty” camp. The nose: rye spice with herbal depth and fruit wreathing. The whiskey hits first, but herbal vermouth is right behind, putting more body on the spirit and cranking the finish in an unexpectedly dry, almost bitter direction. An aperitif whiskey, begging to play with cocktails, or even ice, but good neat. Craft whiskey continues to experiment.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
84,Whistling Andy Straight Bourbon,40.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Local Montana grains in an impressively brown all-Montana bourbon. Has a small-barrel smell to it—a dry wood and hard candy note I’m starting to recognize—and a snap of rye. Interesting: light but not weak in the mouth. I found their moonshine not that clean, but the wood’s done a good job on it. Rye grass and sweet corn mingle with pepper and anise. Clean finish. <i>(Montana only)</i>",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
84,Deerhammer Down Time (Batch 3),46.0,Craft Whiskey,48,"Another American single malt, from Colorado. A meaty, savory aroma, with molasses cookie and herbal cough drop underneath. Roughly sweet in the mouth, with hints of smoke and bitter chocolate, sweet orange and stewed apples, with a strong back note of anise. For all the strange name and really strange logo (antlers on a barrel?), this is not bad at all.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
84,Auchentoshan Virgin Oak,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Morrison Bowmore distillers has recently released a virgin oak-matured expression of its Auchentoshan single malt, which has no age statement. The North American oak casks have been charred prior to receiving this Lowland whisky as their first fillings. The result is a nose of Madeira, cinnamon, vanilla, and white pepper. Very spicy on the palate, with citrus fruits and plain chocolate. Lingering in the finish, with cocoa powder, icing sugar; becoming slightly more bitter with time.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
84,Wemyss Malts Spiced Chocolate Cup (distilled at Clynelish) 1997,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,108,"This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.£67",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
84,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Littlemill) 36 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,282,"Cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, located a couple of miles from Auchentoshan. The nose is sweet, with icing sugar, vanilla, honey, and peaches. Damp grass after a while. Initially sweet and full on the palate, slightly resinous, with marzipan and sherbet, then quite bitter oak kicks in. The marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
84,Master of Malt Boxes Blend,,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,"Master of Malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky. This was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of British rock band Athlete, and it's rather good. Sweet and rich with toffee, orange chocolate, and honey, it's another blend with a lot to say for itself.  £55",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
84,Stalk & Barrel Cask #3,46.0,Canadian,70,"Luscious sweet maltiness underlies a breadth of flavor that belies this whisky’s youth. Hints of acetone, green fruit, and hard pears joust playfully with earthy tones and elements of blue clay. Vague references to mulled red wine center around fleeting cinnamon sticks, ripe red fruit, and the grainy bitterness of buckwheat honey. Rich in grain and grasses, the palate is sweet, oily, and very spicy. Bottling at 46% and not chill filtering should please the anoraks. (<i>Distillery only.) </i>C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
84,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Braes of Glenlivet) 16 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"I have a soft spot for the Braes: not only a forgotten part of Speyside, but the only distillery whose roof I’ve stood on. Anyway, here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked, sugar-topped apple pie, the fruit cracking through warm pastry. Sweet, direct, and slightly nervy, Braes is never going to be a heavy hitter, but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
84,Royal Salute The Diamond Tribute,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,270,"How can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? It's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance, and I object to premium whiskies being just 40% ABV, but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary. It's rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
84,Hancock's President's Reserve,,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Nose is thin and sweet, smelling of popped corn and a bit of oak and vanilla. Mellow and smooth in the mouth, with warm corn and corn syrup notes, more oak and vanilla, but nothing overpoweringly sweet; good balance. Some oak in the finish, a slight curl on the tongue that's not unpleasant. “Single Barrel,” but no barrel number given. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
84,Cody Road Bourbon (Batch 8),45.0,Craft Whiskey,37,"“Aged less than 4 years.” Sharp new oak (this is 30-gallon barrel aged), with hot cinnamon and sugar in the nose. Dry, and a bit hot up front, but its wheat comes through in a smoother, sweeter middle and a gentle, warm finish where corn finally appears. No real flaws here; it could be better integrated, but it has a rough appeal.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
84,Ryan & Wood Straight Rye,43.0,Craft Whiskey,38,"Rye grain, fresh-sawn wood, and a hint of brittle sugar. No corn here: the mashbill is rye, wheat, and malt. Bitter rye edge drives this into the palate, blowing open space for the smoother body to follow and briefly sweeten things up before the rye warp collapses in an oily, spicy, savory finish. Quite discreet and small-scale; this doesn't roar, it urges. Good, but it needs more breadth and wood depth to be great. (<i>Massachusetts only.)</i>",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
84,Bruichladdich Octomore 6.1 5 year old,57.0,Single Malt Scotch,161,"Smoke comes at you immediately, the morning-after smoke of a spent fire, mixing with reeds and rushes, a touch of coconut, and light oak. Water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the Band-Aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies. The palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests, bold and quite thick; honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream. It needs hefty degrees of dilution. A work in progress. £100",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
84,Cardhu 18 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,101,"Cardhu—for me, at least—means intensity, and this delivers precisely that, with masses of

citrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. With

water, there’s red apple and Victoria plum, while the mouth is precise, with

any richness cut with fresh acidity. Zesty and fresh on the finish. Try it in a

Bobby Burns. Released without any fanfare, here’s evidence that Cardhu’s

rebuilding its reputation nicely. £66",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
84,Tomatin Legacy,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Tomatin Legacy has been matured in a combination of bourbon and virgin oak casks, and after an initial release in Europe, worldwide availability will follow. Honey and malt on the nose, melons; fragrant and mildly herbal. White pepper and ultimately a whiff of treacle. Fresh and lively on the sweet, fruity palate, with tinned pineapple, cake mix, and more pepper. Quite dry in the medium length finish, with a suggestion of chili. £26",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
84,Sir Edward’s 12 year old Blended Whisky,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,22,"A very different whisky to its unaged namesake, and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. That’s no bad thing.

This is less sweet than most blends, with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore, and a dusty, grainy note with a touch of oak, grape skin, and sweet heather. That said, not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
84,PennyPacker,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,22,"A straightforward bourbon with no flaws. Nicely balanced flavors of fruit (mandarin, apricot, pineapple), gentle sweetness  (honey, vanilla, caramel), and soft spice (cinnamon, mint). Gentle finish. Nice enough to drink straight in a pinch, but it comes across as more of a mixing bourbon to me.",John Hansell,Fall 2013
84,Pine Barrens Single Malt,,Craft Whiskey,45,"Distilled from a 10&#37;, 70 IBU barleywine from Blue Point Brewing on Long Island. I’m smelling light pine hop notes, dried spruce plank, and heavy fudge; a muddled, heavy nose. Much better in the mouth: the fudge is restrained, the spruce and hops bring a lightness and verve to things. Not the “single malt” you might be expecting, but very much American craft distilling; like nothing else, intriguing, bold, a bit young, and with a lot of promise. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
84,Rough Rider Bull Moose Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Sourced whiskey, moved to used bourbon barrels, then finished in barrels that held their Pine Barrens whiskey (also reviewed this issue). Pine sap, sweet juicy berries, and oak aromas; had to re-nose to be sure on that pine. Mouth is relatively smooth, much more so than the Rough Rider bourbon. Picking up some of that Pine Barren fudge, and a touch of rye grassiness. Finish is warm and spicy. A nice young rye.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
84,Stalk & Barrel Single Malt Cask 1,,Canadian,,"Just four years ago, two Barrys—Stein and Bernstein—opened the doors of Still Waters distillery on

the northern edge of Toronto. Distinct notes of poached pears, marzipan, flaky halva, and cinnamon apple pie embellish sweet ripe cherries, nutmeg, and a vague earthiness. Oatmeal, dry grain, and hot pepper combine on a sweet, polished palate. C$100",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
84,Ellington Reserve 8 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"Ellington has the creamy, sweet, and ultra-smooth mouthfeel down pat. Canada likes its mixing whisky to bite a little, but America prefers a silky smooth glide right down the gullet. Ellington Reserve certainly delivers with its rich, almost oily aura that springs to life with spicy-hot white pepper and newly-split clean firewood. Caramel and brown sugar underscore distinct notes of perfumed, candy-coated licorice amidst fragrant orange blossoms and flat lemon-lime soda. C$17",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
84,Arran 12 year old Cask Strength,,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This is the second batch of Arran 12 year old in cask strength format, and it contains a higher percentage of sherry cask-matured whisky than the first. The out-turn is just over 13,000 bottles. Fresh and sweet on the nose after an initial note of resin, with oats and hot butter. Full-bodied, syrupy and sweet on the palate, with apricots, ripe bananas, nutmeg, and walnuts. The finish majors in plain chocolate, maraschino cherries, and a suggestion of smoky sherry. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
84,Highland Park Einar,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Einar was joint Earl of Orkney from 1014, and this bottling moves the Warrior Series slightly further into familiar Highland Park territory. Some gentle smoke on the nose, with fresh newsprint, ginger, caramel, and a hint of halibut oil. Peat smoke, vanilla, and citrus fruit on the palate. A little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
84,Tullibardine 500 Sherry,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Finished principally in Pedro Ximenez Spanish sherry casks, Tullibardine 500 Sherry has a fragrant nose, with new leather, beeswax, apple, and vanilla. The palate is smooth and sherried, with more leather, brittle toffee, orange peel, honey, and nutmeg. The fruity finish is notably spicy, with lingering wood polish notes. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
84,Dry Fly Straight Triticale,44.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Triticale is a wheat/rye hybrid, which I guess appealed to the wheat-mad Dry Fly distillers. Aromas of grass, bubble gum, and oak. Taste is young, brashly sweet, but smooth enough to spread easily over the tongue. There’s spice—light cinnamon, a zip of allspice heat—and grassy brightness, but they’re dressing on the juicy sweet center. Not flawed, and well-made, but I wish it had more to say. Price is per 375ml.

",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
84,Fitch’s Goat Moonshine,,Craft Whiskey,,"Crystal clear and colorless. Somewhat rich for unaged corn spirit: corn, baked apple, grass, and a very light honeysuckle syrup. Quite mellow on the tongue; sweet, but with a drying finish of baked grain, sweet dried grass, and finally, just a hint of heat high in the mouth. A pleasant little glass.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
84,Wild Geese Single Malt,43.0,Irish,,"If you've ever tasted Connemara peated whiskey, you'll recognize this. As you'd expect for an Irish whiskey, it's sweet, with overripe apples and some pureed, almost creamy, pear. But that's all offset by a sooty, burned-dust smokiness and some gentle spice. It's quite soft and easy-drinking, and the taste is never less than interesting. But these days, it's up against some stiff competition. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
84,Chita Single Grain,48.0,Japanese,33,"At the moment, this is only available through Suntory’s Whisky Shops ‘W’ in Osaka and Tokyo, but as these act as mini-testing outlets, this grain whisky is one that should be noted. The nose is buttery and needs water to allow a flow of fudge, orange peel, crème brûlée, and green banana. It’s a bit like an alcohol-laced Danish. In the mouth there’s chewy toffee-cream sweetness offset by tart red fruits. A lovely, poised grain. ¥3,150",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
84,Limeburners Single Malt M76,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"Arguably the world’s most improved whisky, Limeburners is unrecognizable from the fledgling releases of a few years back. This is matured in 100-liter American oak barrels and finished in port. It is big and rich in flavor, with oily fruit and floral notes, a trace of young green barley, and menthol, licorice, and spicy cardamom. Australian whisky is a tidal wave starting to swell. It has some way to travel, but when it strikes it'll be huge. A$130",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
84,Elements of Islay Br4 (distilled at Bruichladdich),,Single Malt Scotch,,"More from Bruichladdich. The latest in the Elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. The fact that it’s backed up with bran, agave syrup, and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. The palate is sweet, fat, and juicy, typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the Laddie. In time there’s some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. £55 (500 ml)",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
84,Glenglassaugh Evolution,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Following on from Revival, Glenglassaugh has released 6,000 bottles of Evolution, an expression also made after the distillery’s reopening in 2008. It has been matured in first-fill George Dickel barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peaches and gingerbread on the nose, with brittle toffee, icing sugar, and vanilla. Luscious soft fruits dipped in caramel figure on the palate, with coconut and background stem ginger. The finish is medium in length, with spicy toffee.  £50",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
84,Ceran St. Vrain’s Taos Lightning Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Another MGP/LDI-sourced rye, which KGB Spirits then ages additionally at their Alcalde, New Mexico site; it’s tagged as a 15 year old whiskey. An oaky, sweet nose with hot cereal notes. The tongue impact is breathtaking: a hot, thick slam of spice, mint, and wood that cools to a long, sweet mint finish. A bit of water tames it a bit and brings out more oaky notes and more sweetness. Powerful stuff.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
84,Garrison Brothers Texas Bourbon Fall 2012 Release,47.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A 2 year old bourbon made from Texas-grown white corn. It sports a dusty nose full of dry corn and oaky spice. The whiskey is big-boned, juicy and sweet, but with a bitter streak of wood running through it. The finish confirms the youth of the whiskey as it flames in a long, hot wind-up. Some very interesting components here, waiting for better integration. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
84,Old Hobart Overeem Sherry Cask Matured,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"One of the challenges we face with new whisky is that it is evolving quickly, and while we understand that, it's hard to keep up. But the upside is we have shorter memories and that means life's easier for the likes of Old Hobart. A year ago this malt was two-dimensional, overly sweet, and definitely a work in progress. The change is remarkable. Now it's balanced, the sherry and sweetness are in order, and the sappiness has retreated. A$130",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
84,Brenne Estate Cask (Cask #261),40.0,French Whisky,,"What a pleasant change: a world whisky America can get hold of and Europe can&#039;t. This is a tiny French single malt whisky launched first in the U.S. This is very good, with honey, date, liquid chocolate, honeycomb, and some spice bite. But it&#039;s also very unusual, and my warning lights have come on: Brenne is released in single casks, so they vary dramatically. It&#039;s made by a French cognac maker.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
84,Forty Creek Cream,17.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Quite a bit darker than most other whisky creams. Chocolate and caramel—on the burnt side, an interesting difference—in the nose, with a sly hint of whisky behind it. Sweet and creamy, a bit clingy, with just a sting of whisky.  Somewhat generic, though, because that interesting dark caramel is in the nose only, and I’d like this to be a bit more distinctive; more Forty Creek. Still pleasant enough for booze candy! C$29 ",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
84,Balblair 2002 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 2002 expression of Balblair replaces the previous 2001 vintage as the ‘entry level’ bottling. It is naturally colored and non-chill filtered, in line with the rest of the Balblair range, and has been matured in bourbon barrels. Fizzy lemonade, banana skins, and violets on the nose, with soft caramel developing in time. Fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate, with ripe apples and vanilla. Long, floral, and lively in the finish. £40",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
84,Balblair 1996 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Balblair’s 1996 vintage expression replaces the previous 1995 variant as a travel retail-exclusive bottling, and maturation has taken place in bourbon casks. Ginger snaps, peaches, pineapple, and vanilla on the relatively light, fresh nose, which also has just a wisp of smoke in the background. Medium-bodied, the palate offers soft toffee, milk chocolate, spices, and the same fruit notes as the nose. The finish is quite lengthy, with a final flourish of black pepper. Price is per one liter.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
84,Port Ellen 32 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A mix of two types of cask, both refill. Typical Port Ellen on the nose, very clean, precise, and austere, hiding its sweetness in a new pigskin wallet. Though there are hints of apple and almond, it has a chalky edge and surprisingly low levels of smoke. With water there’s squid ink and waxed paper. The palate starts with Darjeeling tea and roasted fruits, then heads to the kelp-strewn seashore. As challenging as ever, and actually a bit too dry. £600",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
84,Auld Reekie,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The old name for Edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of Islay malts, and appropriate it is. The creosote, damp outbuilding, and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong, the peat pronounced in the taste, though gooseberry, green melon, and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix, and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish. ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
84,Bruichladdich Islay Barley 5 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Since its reopening eleven years ago this year, Bruichladdich has been growing barley on Islay—a laudable move. This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious, but already beautifully balanced.£38",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
84,Douglas Laing Old & Rare (distilled at Littlemill) 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"As with Rosebank, Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has made a habit of releasing single malts from the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, which formerly stood not far from Auchentoshan. The latest variant was distilled in November 1991 and bottled early in 2012. The nose is fresh and fruity, with vanilla and boiled sweets. Sweetly spicy on the straightforward palate, with ginger to the fore. Spice continues through the finish, with a hint of cedar. £157",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
84,High West Campfire,46.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"A blend of bourbon, rye, and smoky Scotch whisky. The foundation here is bourbon sweetness (caramel, toffee, vanilla) with a tug-of-war between rye spice (cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg) and peat smoke. Tobacco and honey-soaked berries round out the palate, with additional leather notes on the finish. Not something I would drink every day, but this whisky packs plenty of intrigue. (sourced whiskey)",John Hansell,Fall 2012
84,High West Valley Tan,46.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"High West now has aged whiskey of their own make. This oat whiskey was aged “less than two years” in used cooperage, and that’s just what it looks like, about chardonnay color in the glass. The aroma is mellow and sweet, with a hint of flowers and grapes. Clean and surprisingly mellow sweet grain flavors, even a bit creamy, but the 46% delivers a high bite. Very nice finish. (Limited annual release in December.)",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
84,Double Barrel Talisker/Craigellachie,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"We don't see very much Craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending, and from that we might draw the conclusion that it's not particularly distinctive in its own right. If it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then, because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry, green salad, and some prickly chili pepper, the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. €40",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
84,Seagram’s VO Gold,40.0,Canadian,,"Darker gold in the glass than regular VO, but sporting that same VO nose of caramel and dry corn. Fuller grain sweetness in the mouth, with some nice light fruitiness—white peach, seckel pear—coming out, and there’s a sweet cinnamon smear along the roof of the mouth. Dries significantly toward the end, and finishes quickly, but with everything in good order.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
84,Judd’s Wrecking Ball,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Rich, full, and clean cornbread nose with just a hint of herbal zip; not what I expected at all from a white whiskey with a jokey name and label. Light, vaporous corn glides over the tongue with a hint of fresh grass, easing off the palate to an airy corn finish; a lingering thought of corn. Corn eau de vie, with an accomplished touch on the still; very impressive.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
84,Bushmills Irish Honey,35.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Malt whiskey and honey flip back and forth in the nose; so precisely balanced my nose doesn’t seem to know what to make of it. Light and a bit frisky in the mouth, and the honey is more a grace note than a strong presence, though it does come in more in the finish. Not overly sweet, not heavy, but it’s hard to see the honey as a real game-changer.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
84,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Auchentoshan) 13 year old 1998,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,66,"Another recent addition to Aberdeenshire bottler Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range, launched late last year. The nose is very fruity, with sliced peaches and apricots, plus a porridge-like background note. Relatively full bodied and malty, with intense fruit notes, then dark spices appear. The finish is medium in length, spicy with aniseed balls, then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
84,Balblair 1989 Vintage,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The third and final release of the 1989 vintage of Northern Highland malt Balblair is on sale in Europe initially, with U.S. availability (at approximately $95) this fall. Initially quite reticent on the nose, with a hint of potato chips, mild vanilla, lemon, and unripe bananas. Full and rounded on the palate; nutty, with tropical fruits and lively spice. Medium length in the finish, with apricots, instant coffee, and milky cocoa.  £60",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
84,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Blair Athol) 22 year old 1989,,Single Malt Scotch,,"New to Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range is this single cask (#2927), cask strength offering from Perthshire’s Blair Athol distillery. Sweet and fruity on the nose, majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. Toffee, nougat, and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. Full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose, with vigorous spices, particularly nutmeg, then it begins to dry. The long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. £80",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
84,Glenkinchie Distillers Edition 1996,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Amontillado casks are used here, which add a certain almond-like note to the nose, as well as more obvious oakiness. The effect is a general deepening and lengthening of aroma and flavor. The dry notes have gone, replaced by a sweeter and more generous palette of flavors. The fresh meadow flowers are more like cut flowers in a florist shop, the fruits hint toward peach, and there’s a new citric burst on the finish.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
84,Oban Distillers Edition 1996,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is clearly Oban. Time in Montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. The orange zestiness has also been retained. Like the ‘Kinchie, what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. A new heavy floral note emerges. All in all, there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. Another edition that improves on the original.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
84,Corsair Buckwheat Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Is buckwheat a grain, seed, or nut? Doesn’t matter: you can malt it, so Corsair put it in their rye bourbon as a fourth…whatever. Aromas of corn, vanilla, and teaberry, with a pleasant broadness and light herbal notes. There’s a nutty note to the sweet corn and vanilla, and a move in the direction of astringency, but it’s intriguing, a definite plus. The layered finish has a woody nip to it, that dry earthiness, and sweet corn. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
84,Corsair Rasputin,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Distilled from imperial stout and “vapor infused” with hops, this is a bold example of Darek Bell’s “Alt Whiskeys.” Piney hops, hot toffee, and chocolate notes fill the nose. It’s a long ride on the palate: brisk spice first, then hops and hot malt, a mealy undercurrent that pulls you from a cocoa start to a hot and sweet finish, with a burnt note on the very end. Busy, but consistent.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
84,Alberta Premium,40.0,Canadian,23,"Sweet nose with a hint of soft-boiled egg, digestive biscuit, and cedar (nowhere near as nasty as it might sound!) Warming orange peel notes, toffee, rye grassiness, a trace of horehound, and light, oaky vanilla make a sweet but somewhat angular mouthful. Finish is a bit edgy and boozy; the weakest link in the glass. A bit of water helps the finish a lot. Nothing sticks out too much; a good whisky. (Canada only.) C$24",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
84,Tap 357,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Nose is full of a wonderful, authentic maple syrup smell with a warming background of whisky. The maple’s there in the mouth, too; not overwhelming, and blending well with the whisky. There’s a good balance here, for what it is, and the finish is clean. If you like maple, this is going to do it: it’s not cloying or thick, and could make a great cocktail with — really — bacon.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
84,George Dickel No. 8,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,18,"By far the “sweet spot” when compared to its siblings. The most versatile and the best value of the entire portfolio. Good enough to enjoy neat, but economical enough to use as a mixer. Caramel corn, vanilla, soft nougat, light barrel char, gentle fruit, hint of cinnamon and nutmeg.Value Pick.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
84,Tullibardine 1988,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Tullibardine has been offering a 1988 vintage edition for several years, but in 2011 it bottled a new variant at 23 years of age, matured in a mixture of first-fill bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads. Malt, vanilla, carnations, and peaches on the full nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, with toffee, lively spices, and more herbal notes duly appearing. The finish features cereal, spice, and white chocolate. £47",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
84,Mackmyra Special Number 07,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"The Mackmyra success story just goes on and on. There have now been more Specials than bottlings of Privus or Preludium, and the whisky makers seem to have hit upon a trademark taste that they tweak with each bottling. It's a mix of salt, pepper, citrus, and vanilla, and here the vanilla is at its most subdued and the salt is at its highest. That makes this challenging to anyone unfamiliar with the Mackmyra brand. SEK 649",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
84,"Wemyss Malts ‘Caribbean Fruits,’ 46%",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Wemyss Malts names the sources of these single cask bottlings for the first time in the series. ‘Caribbean Fruits’ is a 1990 Glencadam. The hogshead in which it was matured has yielded just 320 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with apricots, fudge, creamy vanilla, and drinking chocolate. Tropical fruits on the palate, with malt, hazelnuts, and spicy oak. Tannins and cocoa powder in the finish. £80",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
84,Auchentoshan 1999 Bordeaux Cask Matured,58.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"The 11 year old triple distilled Lowland single malt in this bottling has been matured entirely in French oak casks that previously contained Bordeaux wine, then bottled at cask strength. The nose offers contrasting sweet and sour fruit notes, red grapes and gooseberries, damp newspaper, warm stone, and vanilla. Herbal, with cloves and spearmint. Mouth-coating, bittersweet on the palate, with molasses and — inevitably — red wine. Dark chocolate, raisins, and aniseed in the drying finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
84,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glenburgie) 1990 21 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Here’s a rarity. A major player in Ballantine’s, this Moray coast distillery is rarely seen in single malt guise. Very gentle, sweet, and juicy start with licks of cream, a hint of barley, and the gentle grassiness typical of the distillery. In time, light almond and fresh lemon. The palate is lightly sticky — Glenburgie for its lightness always shows good succulence — with buttery vanilla, malt, and a touch of toasty oak. Gentle, sweet, and refreshing. ",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
84,Lark Para,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"Lark Distillery celebrates its 20th year in 2012 and it's starting to settle on a house style: big apple fruity whiskey with menthol, candy cough drop, and hickory notes, and some red berry fruits from maturation in quarter casks made from port barrels. This special bottling uses casks made of wood that held 100 year old Para Port, among the world's finest. All the Lark traits are there, with a liqueur-like bonus. Intriguing. $AUS 132",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
84,Big Bottom Whiskey Port Cask Finish Batch #2 3 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"A relatively high rye grain content for a bourbon (36%). The port adds richness (fleshy fruit) and helps the whiskey taste older than it really is (by masking some of its youthfulness?). Notes of ripe cherry, soft plum, mandarin orange in syrup, dates, and toffee. The spices (cinnamon, mint, and a dusting of cocoa) pick up mid-palate and finish strong and warming. A slight bit more port than I would prefer, but the spice vibrancy still shines through. ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
84,Hudson Manhattan Rye Whiskey,46.0,Rye Whiskey,,"Hot nose, plenty of rye spice — it is 100% rye — mint, bay leaf, sweet clove. Quite a kick, but there's good flavor behind it; more spice, oak, and a firm sweetness. The finish is quite quick, just some dry rye in the back of the mouth, and gone. Better-behaved than most Hudson whiskeys I've had; hardly mellow, but enjoyable. Price per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
84,New Holland Double Down Barley Brewers' Whiskey,45.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),,"Brazen stuff, blowing raw, fresh-sawn oak (six months in small, heavy char barrels) and cocoa/caramel right out of the glass. For all its youth, it's drinkable; hot, assertively oaky, but drinkable, thanks to the glowing depth of malt character in the glass. The oak's buoyed by rich, cocoa-tinged toffee, and the finish is like a very good hot chocolate. It's going like crazy; love to see where it would be in four years. Limited edition of 500 bottles. Price per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
84,Armorik Classic,46.0,French Whisky,,"Armorik is made by Distilleries Warenghem in the Brittany region of Northern France and you expect something gutsy and rugged. This is nothing of the sort, though the relatively high strength and the fact that it's non-chill filtered ensure plenty of taste, including a scattering of spices that tickle and tingle the palate at the finish. Before then, though, the key flavors are vanilla, honeyed cereal, overripe melon, and banana. Delightful.  €38 ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
84,Glengoyne 1996 Vintage,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Exclusively for the U.S. as an addition between the 10 and the 17 year old. Central to its composition is a ‘parcel’ of refill hogsheads, to which a number of European oak butts have been added. Initially slightly herbal on the nose, with developing fresh fruits and vanilla. Finally, caramel and damp leaves underfoot. Full and confident on the palate, with tropical fruits, stem ginger, and hazelnuts. Drying in the finish, with spicy, rich oak and creamy allspice. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
84,Laphroaig Cairdeas,,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Distinctively pale in color. (A hint of its age?) This annual limited edition release is finally available in the U.S. Youthful, vibrant, and thumping, with the sea flowing through its veins. Coal tar, peat smoke, brine, seaweed, bright fruit (pear, tangerine), and soft vanilla all compete for attention. The only thing holding me back from scoring it higher is that it comes across as a bit too youthful.",John Hansell,Fall 2011
84,Tomintoul 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,54,"One of Speyside’s youngest distilleries, Tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently, when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. This non-chill filtered example is, for me, the best of the bunch. Pale in hue, it has a light, clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. The palate has pear juice, light vanilla, and a long sweet finish. £34 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
84,Tomatin 30 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Selected by distillery manager Douglas Campbell, currently in his 50th year at Tomatin. It has been matured in a combination of American and European oak casks, and just 200 cases have been released. Citrus fruits on the nose, notably oranges, and apricots, with a hint of damp soil. More fruit on the palate, orange wine gums, ginger, and gentle oak. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with encroaching aniseed and tannins. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
84,Millstone Peated,40.0,Dutch,,"Van Zuidam distillery’s star has risen rapidly — it’s under ten years old —and its single malt and rye are confident forays into the world of whisky. So is this. This is 5 ½ years old and is a distinctly different take on peat, with little acerbity, oil smoke, or charcoal. A softer spiciness is present — it’s an almost ginger cake quality, with menthol and lemon-lime candy in the mix. €55 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
84,Hazelburn 8 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Hazelburn was first produced at Springbank during 1997. It varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ Springbank, as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. The 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. The nose is fresh, light, fruity, and faintly resinous, with gentle spice. Sherbet, malt, and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate, with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
84,Glen Breton Ice,,Canadian,,"Aged 10 years in icewine barrels — a Canadian specialty — and like icewine, comes in a tiny bottle. Sweet malt aromas, some grape character, with a brandy-like edge slicing through it. The high proof comes through as evaporative rather than hot, and it’s quite drinkable undiluted: some creaminess even, and some of that sweet icewine intensity to it. A drop of water brings more whisky out: bold, a bit hot. The icewine finishing is an experiment with promise. Price is per 250 ml.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
84,"Benromach Origins 12 year old, Batch 2",50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The newest member of the ever-expanding range hailing from Gordon & MacPhail’s own distillery in Forres. This example has been aged in port pipes — and it shows immediately on the nose. Benromach is a teasing mid-weight Speysider, and this has added depth of sweet damson jam-like aromas mixed with Seville orange (marmalade) and some milky nut. Rich fruitcake flavors on the tongue. This is a very well balanced and precocious 12 year old. Worth a look. ",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
84,Edradour Port Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The latest in this Perthshire distillery’s ongoing Port Cask series of releases has been wholly matured in a bodega port butt since being distilled in 2003. The nose is fragrant, featuring summer berries and glacé cherries, while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream, contrasting with red wine notes. The finish is quite lengthy, with raspberries, spicy oak, and a whiff of smoke. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
84,"Glen Ord, Milroy’s of Soho Single Cask",,Single Malt Scotch,,"A Glen Ord bottled by the London wine and spirits establishment of Milroy’s, and a relatively rare opportunity to sample single malt from this Diageo-owned distillery. The nose initially presents lemon zest, then peaches and caramel, with cream soda notes. Very fruity and lively in the mouth, with a nutty, malty undercurrent. Medium in length; firm, with spicy fruit lasting to the very end, accompanied by a touch of well-mannered fresh oak. £45 Currently not available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
84,Glenfiddich Age of Discovery 19 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,123,"Named in honor of the early Portuguese explorers, this newest Glenfiddich expression has spent a lengthy period of secondary maturation in Madeira drums. This has given a rich sweet fruitiness — think blueberry muffins mixed with moss alongside date, fig, and black grape. The palate is sweet and smooth with a pickup of gingery spices toward the finish. Well balanced and quite a departure. (Travel Retail exclusive, not available in the U.S.) £75",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
84,Sullivan’s Cove Cask Strength,60.0,Australian Whisky,,"There are now more distilleries on the Australian island of Tasmania than there are in Ireland, Japan, or Canada, and the island is demanding to be taken seriously as a whisky territory. At the forefront of the Aussie invasion is Sullivan’s Cove, once home to some decidedly ordinary whiskies, but now kicking into gear. This needs water, but is a unique mix of fruit, nuts, and soft malt. Clean, more-ish, and unique, this is Australia raising its flag.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
84,Michael Collins 10 Year Old,40.0,Irish,,"Don’t remember ever reading that Michael Collins suffered from schizophrenia… This is a bewildering whiskey suffering from an identity crisis; its fruity apple Irish heart wrapped in wood, some peat, and conversely, some sherbet and sugar-coated almonds. It’s not unpleasant — far from it — but the journey from sweet apple to sharp spice is a challenge. Stay with it and ultimately the complexities of the malt win through. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
84,Collingwood,40.0,Canadian,,"Sweet, rich candy — pulled taffy, boiled sweets — with a little hot edge. Signature Canadian sweetness, but with more depth and a gently mouth-coating feel. Touches of vanilla, caramel, and some of those candy notes again, but the finish isn’t cloying. No overt evidence of the toasted maplewood finishing. Another exploration of what Canadian whisky is, or can be, that stays within bounds and makes the sweet whisky idea work.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
84,Blair Athol,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. The finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt. ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
84,Caol Ila,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Without water, this is an aggressive malt, sharp and acerbic. With water, it’s still more in your face than any official bottling. Where you tend to associate Caol Ila with oily, peaty, and maritime characteristics, this is altogether more feisty and ballsier, with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of Islay, and even a nod to its peppery cousin on Skye. On the nose there is peat, but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there, too. The taste is quite sharp, with bitter lemon, licorice, and sooty peat to the fore. Certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery, and far removed from last year’s relatively gentle 25 year old release, but there are questions over the balance, and whether it’s a better whisky is a moot point. ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
84,Hazelburn,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. The nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it, though, and it’s a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. Later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. An interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling. ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
84,Stronachie,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A “branded” malt, meaning we don’t know which distillery this whisky came from. Fresh and quite fruity (peach, nectarine, golden raisin, orange, pineapple) with a nice underlying honey, vanilla, and caramel sweetness. Soft, gentle, malty finish. It’s clean, nicely balanced, and pleasant.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
85,Dry Fly Straight Wheat,45.0,Wheat Whiskey,40,"A fragrant nose offers scents of orange blossom, cinnamon, lemon peel, vanilla, and balanced oak. The palate has a drier orange peel note, as well as peanut shells, cinnamon, ginger, and bitter chocolate. Quite dry on the back palate, where the wood influence becomes much more prominent. The finish is light, with bitter chocolate, some nuttiness, tobacco, dried herbs, and drying oak. Pleasant spiciness, cinnamon, and citrus overall.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
85,Balcones Baby Blue Corn (Batch 19-1),46.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"A polarizing nose of tropical fruit (papaya, mango, melon) drenched in butterscotch vies with the distinct aroma of tennis shoes on asphalt. The palate is hot, dry, and somewhat ashy, with billowing smoke, tobacco leaf, and nuttiness, undercut by lime and orange oil. Drying and oak-driven on the finish, it’s sweetened by the addition of water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Spirit Hound Colorado Honey Malt (Barrel No. 4),45.0,Straight Malt,65,"Straight malt whiskey finished in barrels that previously held honey. The nose is enchanting, perfumy with fresh flowers, bubble gum, cinnamon-dusted apple slices, pink peppercorn, sassafras, and salt water taffy. The honey-barrel finish shows itself on the palate, which has milk chocolate, sugary chai, lemon, molasses, pralines, and, of course, unctuous honey. So syrupy and sweet, it truly gives new meaning to “dessert whiskey.”",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Chambers Bay Straight Bourbon (Batch 6),,Bourbon/Tennessee,43,"Lots to unpack on the nose: dried orange peel, blueberry, maple syrup, herbs, and fragrant spices—cinnamon, allspice, clove, caraway; with water, green papaya and cedar. The palate is dry and chewy with oak, orange, cinnamon, clove, cedar oil, roasted nuts, chocolate, and crushed red pepper. It finishes simply, with dry oak, nutty chocolate, and cinnamon.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Strathcolm 8 year old,40.0,Single Grain Whisky,36,"Spicy from the start, this has aromas of earthy whole spices, rolled marzipan, new books, and bakery shelves. Before it lays down the spices, it shows its hand with sweet vanilla, cereal notes, flapjacks, and almond paste on the palate. The finish has toasted oats, golden syrup, and spiciness. Decent whisky, though the sweetness is pegged back, and the other Strathcolm grains show greater personality. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
85,Blaum Bros. Straight Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The nose has fruity hard candy, citrus oil, and lime Popsicle stick, along with expressive grain. On the palate, the sturdy proof holds up well to a few drops of water, revealing iced herbal tea, mint leaves, cinnamon, black pepper, and orange oil, as well as plenty of chewy oak. The finish is where this whiskey’s personality really starts to show, offering rich dark chocolate and roasted almonds.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Penelope Four Grain Straight Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,38,"Notes of red fruit, blueberry, dried cherries, Grape Nuts, lemon oil, and an herbal spiciness on the nose, balanced against an influence of drying oak. The palate is smooth and light, with cinnamon, milk chocolate, peanut shells, green pepper, and oak tannins. The finish is sweet and offers a tropical note of sweet orange and lemon. This whiskey is light, but the four-grain mashbill creates an intriguing non-traditional profile.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
85,Tom’s Town Double Oaked Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"A nose of dark fruit, figs, sassafras, powdered orange candy, and brown sugar leads to a palate that’s lightly nimble, with vanilla, iced tea, lemon, cracked pepper, and textured oak. Water brings out sweeter notes, with orange and strawberry balanced against herbal flavors and eucalyptus. The finish is sweet and a bit light, tasting of sliced orange, vanilla syrup, toasted oak, and roasted herbs. A balanced, light, and somewhat non-traditional bourbon.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
85,Town Branch Kentucky Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,39,"Uncommonly delicate and floral: a bundle of honeysuckle and grandma’s potpourri on the nose, mingled with cantaloupe, almond milk, rice pudding, peach, and Nilla Wafer. It fills the mouth with an oily texture and flavors of tropical fruit, peach, melon, hazelnut, and citrus soap, finishing with lingering tobacco and nuts. Town Branch uses the same proprietary yeast for this bourbon as its Pearse Irish whiskey, which may explain the unusual flavor profile.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Glenrothes 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"Quite youthful on the nose, with barley, vanilla, and finally nectarines. Smooth and medium-bodied, with floral notes, custard, and milk chocolate. A relatively short finish, with sappy oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
85,Balcones Texas Pot Still Straight (Batch 19-1),46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Oily, earthy, and a bit vegetal on the nose, with nori, moss, caramel corn, toasted pecans, barbecue potato chips, and butterscotch haystacks. The oily-textured palate is heavy on smoky char, roasted corn and nuts, savory mesquite-cooked meat, and spearmint. On the finish, it’s all cigar wrapper, dark chocolate, mint oil, and coffee bean, with plenty of lingering char flavor.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
85,Filibuster Dual Cask Finished Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,41,"Faintly herbal but mostly sweet aromas: Swedish fish, Twizzlers, treacle, marshmallow, and toasted almonds, as well as Lipton tea bag and pine needles. The flavor is dominated by oak, along with charred corn, black pepper, roasted nuts, and pipe tobacco, while the finish takes a slight turn with lingering pine and cigar notes.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
85,Grant’s Cask Editions Ale Cask Finish,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,20,"Buttercream, fresh-cut bread, taffy candy, citrus, and a distinctive hoppy note from the craft ale casks. Charmingly smooth but quite light bodied, there is warmed bramble fruit, bitter grapefruit peel, and plenty of peppery spice. This stands up well to other ale-cask finished whiskies, but in the Grant’s range there are better whiskies with more to offer.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
85,Clan MacGregor,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,10,"Banana chips, peppercorn, coriander stalks, dry grasses, cracker bread, faint lemon zest, butterscotch, and green apple; more grain than malt character evident. With watery citrus, butterscotch, walnut, lemon peel, and caramel initially, it’s lighter-bodied but balanced. It develops more spices and a fine texture as it dilutes, lifted by cinnamon, caramel, and gentle spices. Overlook the hard-to-love nose, and this is tasty both neat and over ice.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
85,Crooked Water Regatta Rum Finish Rye,,Rye Whiskey,50,"Three and half year old rye finished in rum casks from Barbados. Rum-influenced notes of ripe mango, guava, and orange curaçao dominate the nose. A light, nimble mouthfeel with rum sweetness on the palate, plus candied mandarin, lemon, pineapple, and a light pine note. Similar notes on the finish, helped by a sprinkling of white pepper. Flavorful and rich, with the overlay of rum sweetness dominating the rye notes to some degree.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,Black Feather Bourbon,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The nose begins with a whiff of new wood, but moves to orange peel, apricot, green banana, raisin bread, black tea, and raspberry Popsicle. The palate is youthful and syrupy in texture, with notes of milk chocolate, burnt almond, vanilla frosting, and chili spice. The finish is barrel-influenced but light and honeyed, with notes of milk chocolate, nuttiness, and spice.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,Horse Soldier Barrel Strength,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"This bourbon is named for the Special Forces horsemen, known as the horse soldiers, who served in Afghanistan. The nose starts earthy and herbal, with notes of leather, licorice, and light smokiness. Drying oak on the palate, with bitter orange and herbal notes, roasted walnuts, and burnt cinnamon and brown sugar. A finish of orange, bitter chocolate, and espresso beans. Water coaxes out raspberry and honey blossom.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,District Made Straight Rye,47.0,Rye Whiskey,45,"Orange and flower aromas mingled with cinnamon candy, tea leaves, and fresh-cut wood show off the lively side of the grain from the start. In the mouth, this whiskey is spicy and vibrant, with chili pepper, Hot Tamales, green banana, and plenty of oak, finishing on dark chocolate, black tea, and lingering heat. A young whiskey, but well on its way.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
85,Gun Fighter Double Cask Rye,50.0,Rye Whiskey,34,"Orange, mango, strawberry candy, and licorice on the nose, while water brings out watermelon, more mango, and a soft wood note. A light palate offers fruitcake, orange, blackberry, chocolate, almond, gingersnaps, tobacco, and cedar spice. A finish of vanilla, orange, and more tobacco, with water bringing out hot chocolate, orange, burnt espresso beans, and drying oak. Orangey and tropical at the outset, but also deep and nutty, particularly on the finish.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection American Oak,,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"The nose is a bit hot and generally restrained, with dried leaves, earthiness, and waxy crayons. Light-bodied, very soft, and somewhat juicy. Stone fruit and grain flavors combine for an enjoyable peach-pie quality before the tannic finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
85,Charbay Doubled & Twisted,45.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),50,"A blend of 3 year old single malt (30%), 3 year old whiskey distilled from pilsner beer (20%), and 7 year old whiskey distilled from stout (30%). Unsurprisingly, the nose is hoppy, with an overlay of pine bough and a tropical fragrance of lemon and pineapple. The palate is deeper, with more hops and pine, plus bitter citrus, lime, and white pepper. The finish melds bitter chocolate, roasted pecans, and toasty oak. (3,960 bottles)",David Fleming,Spring 2019
85,Gentleman Jack,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,32,"A host of sweet confections—caramel corn, candied apples, toasted marshmallow, bubble gum, and gobs of banana taffy—are reminiscent of a warm summer night at the fair. The palate speaks of orchard fruits, sweet golden apples, and poached pear, as hints of peach and cocoa appear on the clean, enjoyable, and succinct finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
85,St. George Spirits Breaking & Entering,43.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"American whiskey takes an unusual direction with this blend of straight bourbons from Kentucky and Tennessee, straight rye from Tennessee, and malt whiskey made by St. George Spirits. On the nose, stewed plums and apricots, orange gumdrops, almonds, earthy grain—spilled wine in the garden. A resinous and hoppy palate, with poached pears, cooked ginger, lemon, white pepper, and milk chocolate-covered almonds. Lemon pith and mild oak on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
85,Navazos Palazzi Malt Bota Punta,,Spanish Whisky,104,"Red apple, dried fig, clove, baked ham, and plums boiled in sugar in this warm, fragrant, and aromatic whisky made with Spanish malt. The complexity of the nose is not sustained, as the spice characters dominate the palate after the initial few seconds. Baked orange, verging on tropical fruits, is overthrown by the black pepper and clove welling up from the underside of the tongue, leaving a bitter chicory aftertaste. (900 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
85,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Purple Corn,45.0,World Whisky,50,"Pepper and allspice light up with savory brisket notes, star anise, a dry nuttiness, and a pile of peanut shells. The flavor slowly comes into focus with stewed apple, red currant, pomegranate, and cranberry, background spices, and late caramel sweetness. The finish has throbbing, gum-tingling heavy clove notes with toffee penny chews and red licorice.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
85,A.P. Hotaling J.H. Cutter,48.0,American Blended Whiskey,50,"Expressively aromatic, with orange, chai spices, incense, spearmint, and Juicy Fruit gum, buttressed by earthy moss and cedar. Equally vivid flavors of dry oak, pepper, cinnamon Red Hots, dried orange peel, orange pekoe tea, and chili-chocolate, but it loses steam on the finish. Water tames some of the brasher qualities without dampening the liveliness.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
85,Blackened,45.0,American Blended Whiskey,43,"A collaboration between the late Dave Pickerell and metal group Metallica, this sourced straight whiskey blend was finished in so-called “black brandy barrels” for several weeks to the sound of Metallica’s music—a method aimed at enhancing the aging process. Dusty oak, potpourri, leather, licorice, vanilla, and caramel, along with banana, raisins, and plums on the palate. Bitter chocolate and spicy heat punctuate the finish, with a light citrus note.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
85,Proper No. Twelve,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Initially, Conor McGregor’s whiskey seems more laborious than notorious, with a rather unremarkable nose of fondant orange and mediocre spices, not helped by the first sip’s wishy-washy fruitiness of diluted orange and fudge, but before you tap out, it gets back on its feet and starts swinging for the fences with a redeeming comeback of gingerbread, clove, pepper, charred oak, and a knockout, gum-tingling buzz of spice.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
85,Jim Beam Repeal Batch,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,18,"A delicate nose of golden raisin, Cracker Jack peanuts, pleasing citrus, and hints of clove. The palate is fairly straightforward in its honeyed sweetness and warm cereal notes, with hints of tobacco leaf. Not exciting, but enjoyable in an understated way and a nice leisurely sipper.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
85,Two Stars Kentucky Straight Bourbon,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"Sweet and fruity to start, with Swedish fish, orange Creamsicle, circus peanuts, and some dusty spices: pepper, caraway, and allspice. There’s zippier spice and citrus on the palate, along with chili-chocolate, peanut brittle, cherry cough syrup, and a little leathery oak on the finish. It’s soft and light-bodied—serviceable, but not exciting. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Highland Queen Majesty 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Sulfury funk on the nose might intimidate, but it’s a harbinger of the whisky’s strong sherry influence. There are also aromas of cinnamon, allspice, tangy stewed fruit, roasted almonds, and saline. The palate is intensely floral, with raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, red berries, and a little milk chocolate. Richly flavored, but light-bodied; a gentle sherried whisky. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Wyoming Whiskey Steamboat Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Aromas of dry cedar, used sandpaper, and hay mingle with candied fruit—green apple Jolly Rancher, Asian pear—along with earthy tea leaves. The wood-forward palate highlights more tea leaves, dried apple rings, apple skins, gentle clove spice, and cedar. It finishes with dry wood, cloves, and a hint of dried orange peel. A peculiar whiskey that seems unsure of itself.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Cadée Deceptivus Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,50,"Soft oak, brown sugar, and a back note of iron start things off, followed by hints of corn muffin, red candy, and a subtle note of dried red fruit. The palate leads with vanilla rice pudding, a light note of orange peel, milk chocolate, and green apple. It’s creamy, light, and sweet, with baking spice enlivening the chocolate. The finish is lengthy, ending with vanilla icing and a buttery note.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
85,Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,29,"A delicate grassy nose with aromas of bread dough, green bananas, cardamom, and lemon. Light-bodied on the palate, with pleasant flavors of cardamom, lemon, and white pepper, it rushes through to a more substantial finish of roasted walnuts, tobacco leaf, unsweetened chocolate, and oak. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Pig’s Nose,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,29,"Stick your snout into aromas of rich tea biscuits, honey, tangerine, toasted almond chips, candied pineapple chunks, and a prickle of spice. It’s youthful but integrated, the grain domineering over the malt. A likable flavor sequence begins with lovely honey sweetness, honeydew melon, and pear, before a citrus phase, followed by an ominous wave of spice which vanquishes the sweet fruits, leaving a swift, spicy finish. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
85,The Street Pumas’,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Behind its comic book label, this pallid 3 year old, 40% malt content whisky has a nose of vanilla frosting, fudge, caramel, whole lime, orange peel, fresh apple, nougat, sesame seed bars, and faint notes of ground black pepper This works beautifully in long drinks, with its light character of dominant lemon flavors, vanilla, fizzy sherbet, and traces of spice. No messing around: it’s sharp, tangy, zingy, and refreshing. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
85,Clontarf 1014 Classic Blend,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,22,"Named after the Irish victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, this has a nose of vanilla, dusty spices, old sweet-shop toffee, dried banana, and polished wood furniture. While the tasty palate comprises fresh green apple, pear, citrus fruits, vanilla, boiled candies, and an appealing lift of spice, this would be tastier still with a bit more weight behind it.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
85,Trader Joe’s Bourbon Cask Finish Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,20,"On the nose, spiced plums, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and cooked fruit mingle with seawater and a waft of guava. A tug of war between sweet—orange oil, cookies with lemon icing—and spice—cloves, dried ginger—resolves into a finish of milk chocolate with a hint of hookah tobacco. This is light and a bit hot, but its perfumy character shows well. Finished in first-fill bourbon barrels. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Ainsley Brae Oak Cask Matured Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,28,"The scents of a forest floor—dried leaves, old pine needles, twigs—mingle with stewed fruit, biscuity malt, lemon oil, and rose petal soap. The palate is light and candy-sweet, like strawberry jelly beans, candied rose petals, and sugar cookies tinged with cinnamon. Youthful and very light, but pleasant. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Ainsley Brae Sherry Cask Finished Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,30,"An initial aroma of carrot peelings gives way to cedar, allspice, lemon, and chamomile; with water added, carrot cake, almond shell, and lemon icing emerge. On the palate there’s chamomile tea with lemon and clove, candied violet, orange, and cedar, swooping into a finish of oak and dried flowers. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Douhans,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,18,"Coconut cream, orange peel, vanilla, and plenty of sweet grain permeate the nose and carry through to the palate, which is uncomplicated and youthful; a creamy, floral, banana confection touched with lemon. Light and simple—if you like this style of whiskey, this is a good option. (<em>Walmart</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Wolfhound,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,19,"Ripe orchard fruits, white flowers, saltines, green apple candy, and a hint of floor polish on the nose, along with pie crust that expresses itself as a sweet nuttiness on the palate. The flavors are simple—caramel, roasted hazelnuts, milk chocolate, and orange—and the finish short. If you’re after an ordinary Irish blend, this should do the trick. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,WhistlePig Farmstock Rye Crop 002,43.0,Craft Whiskey,73,"Whistle Pig raised the share of its own 2 year old rye from 20 percent to 32 percent in this second Farmstock release, balancing it against 6 and 10 year old sourced ryes, like in the 001 release. Fresh oak mixes with vanilla, orange peel, and pepper on the nose, leading to a palate of vanilla and butterscotch. Citrus emerges with water. Pepper notes return on the finish, along with chocolate and caramel. There’s youthfulness here, but also potential.",David Fleming,Fall 2018
85,Kings County Peated Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"On the nose, the peat presents itself as an autumn bonfire, with dried logs and dried leaves mingling with gentle spices of white pepper, dried ginger, and a bit of salinity. The wood keeps burning through the palate, which is fairly hot and replete with classic bourbon flavors of vanilla, caramel, roasted nuts, and apples. Pleasant enough, but ultimately a simple whiskey.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
85,Pennington Distilling Co. Davidson Reserve Rye,50.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Though it takes some easing into, this whiskey shows pretty clove and vanilla notes on the nose, along with some Elmer’s glue and grape Kool-Aid. The palate is where the rye grain starts to shine, with spice, peaches, plums, and milk and white chocolate, and cooked cherries on the finish. Water is a must to cut through the youthful heat.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
85,Grant’s Elementary Carbon 6 year old,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,30,"The black-labeled Carbon relates to heavily charred casks, which bring aromas of toffee, raisin, chocolate, dark concentrated fruits, barbecued meat, and ashy soot. The smokiness broods malevolently if you leave the glass. The texture feels too light to shoulder the flavors of dark char, toffee, spice, and dark fruity chocolate as the balance becomes swamped in smoke. It’s like a young child wearing their father’s thickest winter overcoat. (<em>Global Travel Retail only</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
85,Baltimore Spirits Co. Epoch Rye (Batch 1),50.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"This is one for the oak fanatics. Wood and grain assert themselves right from the start, but the nose retains balance with aromas of butterscotch, fresh ginger, and herbs. The oak-forward palate shows pleasant flavors of cherry cough drop, dark chocolate, blackberries, red licorice, star anise, and ginger. Oak continues on the finish, which has nice length. Don’t be shy about adding water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
85,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Port Cask Finish,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,30,"This is finished for 8 months in tawny port pipes and is quite restrained on the early nose, opening up to reveal rose petals, milk chocolate, and double cream.  The palate is floral, with raisins  and red currants. Drying in the  finish, with peppery oak and  cinnamon.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
85,Pearse Distiller’s Choice,42.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,50,"A stronger grain distillate characterizes this malt and grain blend aged for under a decade. More forthright than the Original, with mint leaves, fresh orange, dry spices, lemon peel, and the bouquet of aromatic florist’s grasses. Enticing soft fruits are subdued by the grain flavors of spicy green herbal notes and astringent clove, although it mellows to a redeeming finish of sherry trifle and bubble gum. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Millstone) 6 year old,,Dutch,75,"Originating from Zuidam Distillers’ diverse inventory of casks, this single malt whisky conjures thoughts of bread dough, white grape, and slightly sour spices. The orange flavors start as a deep glow, then blossom beautifully into rich marmalade aromas. Initially mouth-drawing, with bold, juicy flavors of peach and orange supported by toffee and a gentle lift of spices. Appetizing taste of spiced orange cake to finish. (637 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Slyrs) 3 year old,,World Whisky,90,"White pepper-dappled summer fruits on the nose, with squishy overripe melon, banana peel, zesty lime, dried grasses, and clove, with a slightly rubberized note like BMX handlebar grips. This young Bavarian single malt has a rich, syrupy texture and tastes of sour fruits, bitter orange peel, and barley, shifting to creamy caramel and peppery spices. Finish of caramel, peppercorn, and peach pit. Not bad at all. (691 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,J&B Rare,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,23,"Justerini &amp; Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light, Speyside-style blend has grassy notes, with crystalized lemon slices, Bramley apple peel, woodsmoke, and almonds. Light and sweet on the tongue, it unpacks lemon peel, satsuma, juicy watermelon, pepper, and aniseed. Grain whisky and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,Davidson Reserve Four Grain Tennessee Straight Whiskey (Batch 1),50.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"This whiskey shows some green-spirit youth, but it’s headed in a good direction, with sassafras, toasted nuts, leather, forest aromas, and a touch of furniture polish. It’s much bigger on the palate, as burnt peanut candies meet baking spices, and treacle. The wood jumps out a bit and the fiery youth is undeniable, but plenty to like. (2,580 bottles)",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,J. Henry & Sons 5 year old Wisconsin Straight Bourbon (Batch 34),46.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"The nose offers a nice mélange of herbal and fruit notes, as pine sap, earthy forest floor, and menthol balance with sweet Bananas Foster and baked apple. More banana on the palate, plus juicy stone fruits sprinkled with cinnamon before a drying finish that nicely weaves cocoa, spices, oak, and saddle leather.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,New Deal Distiller’s Reserve Oregon Straight Bourbon,40.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Makes a pleasant first impression as sweet apple and corn notes meet summer flowers, Cracker Jack, and fresh oak. The palate shows a pleasingly oily texture, as butterscotch candy and roasted peanuts come with hints of spice and orange peel. The nutty finish shows toasted almonds and caramel.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,Tommyrotter Triple Barrel American Whiskey,46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Aromas of menthol, licorice, and herbs have a slightly antiseptic quality, yet the caramelized oak and grilled pineapple flavors keep it grounded in bourbon. Bold and intriguing on the palate, it pours a bit hot, with lots of cedar shingle and sandalwood balanced by banana and toasted marshmallow. Cinnamon and candied orange on the finish. A blend of Indiana bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys finished in red wine casks.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,Ballyhoo,43.0,Irish,30,"Fresh and grassy, it’s quite dainty, with peach, Liquorice Allsorts, and light florals. Sugary sweetness, lemon slices, and candied orange jellies, concluding with hot white pepper and residual sweetness. This is sourced 4 year old grain whiskey finished in port barrels, though the label does not disclose this. Otherwise, an original, delectable finishing concept.

85,Dewar’s 18 year old The Vintage,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"Vanilla laced with spice, fondant icing, grapefruit peel, and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. In the mouth, grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla, yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. A lingering bitter orange finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
85, Dewar’s White Label,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"Honey, fudge, a little melon and white grape, dry roasted spices, and peppercorn, but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. The palate has pulpy white melon, lemon, lime, and some grapefruit acidity, before sweetening with honey. Quite tart at times, some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. A clean, juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
85,FEW Italia,,Craft Whiskey,50,"Super floral with bright lemon and yuzu, this beams with originality, as violet candies, rose petal, and pine forest join the fray. The mouthfeel has a satisfying oily texture and a slightly tart, bright citrus lift before the creamy sweetness settles in, nicely balanced with drying oak tannins.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
85,Coppersea Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye,48.0,Rye Whiskey,80,"A very grain-forward nose, reminiscent of caraway or a fresh pumpernickel loaf. A soft, dusty rye, with hints of peppermint, spearmint, and cinnamon candy and bitter brown sugar. Quite dry, with some bitter oak, dry hay, and fresh-sawn lumber. Dried herbs, grilled pineapple, and lingering pepper on the finish. Made from rye malted by hand and distilled in direct-fired stills, this whiskey is more focused on grain than oak. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
85,New York Distilling Co. Ragtime Rye Applejack Finish,50.0,Rye Whiskey,46,"A true fruit bouquet on the nose, with apple, lemon, peach, and apricots, balanced by gentle wood. Very buttery and creamy on the palate, with a panoply of earthy white chocolate, pretty baking spice, and minced apple. A little too much fresh lumber and banana flavor, but well-balanced and intriguing. The applejack cask finish is a nice touch, but the rye could still use more time in the barrel. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
85,Whiskey Del Bac Classic Unsmoked,42.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Driven by earthy oak and dark cocoa on the nose, this whiskey is alluring in its rustic richness, with saddle leather and a pocketful of dried fruit pulled from an old backpack. On the palate, the cherry and red berry fruit meet some pleasant peppery and clove spice, with the impression of lemon oil. Pleasingly drinkable, with caramel and more oak on the modest finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
85,Kurayoshi 3 year old,46.0,Japanese,65,"Aged for just 3 years, the nose is a fresh fruit salad of green apple, honeydew, lychee, and kumquat. The green fruits and tangy citrus on the palate fall under attack from peppery arugula leaves and active spices. A structure as light as cotton candy; the flavor of orange taffy is all that remains when the dust settles. The finish is dry and peppery, with a slight herbal note. (1,440 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
85,Lost Spirits Abomination The Crying of the Puma,54.0,Miscellaneous,50,"An aggressive punch of peat—creosote, tar, rubber, and seaweed—mingles with wood spice, butterscotch, vanilla pudding, and red apple on the nose. The palate shows charred meat, charred wood, earthy smoke, crème brûlée, and red apple flavors. The short, ashy finish satisfies with dark chocolate and black pepper. At such a high proof, it takes water well and develops in the glass.

85,Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Straight Rye (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017),,Rye Whiskey,90,"Initially, an unwanted mustiness is present, but it quickly turns into a damp cellar note, followed by dill, eucalyptus, fresh oak, and mint. Hints of smoke emerge over pecan shell and chewing tobacco. Then a cherry cough syrup note appears, with baking spices gaining steam, but the whiskey never truly finds a desired dominant note or balance. The finish gives it hope: it lingers with a hint of brown sugar.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
85,Woody Creek Straight Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"An enjoyable 2 year old from Colorado, the sweet stone fruit nose, laced with mint and herb garden, betrays this spirit as a bit young and primary. Still a touch hot and lacking some intensity, but pleasing clover honey sweetness on the palate and long, warming spice with a cocoa finish bode very well for the future.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
85,Fukano 12 year old Single Cask No. 273,,Japanese,100,"Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, and burnt sugar crackling atop crème brûlée, with ground almond and tarragon. The texture is mouth drawing and astringent, like it’s warping the dimensions of your mouth for its own ends. Dark chocolate and bitter plum transition into cocoa powder and plum pudding with traces of oak. Persistent heat, with herbal notes and chili spice on the finish. Leave the water aside. (456 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
85,St. George Baller Single Malt,47.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Hugely floral and perfumed on the nose, with rose petals, violet candies, and dried orange peel. This is the Gewürztraminer of American single malts—sweet lychee, laced with sachet aromas that explode as if opening Grandma’s dresser drawer. The palate is more tropical; dried pineapple, canned peach syrup, and spice. This could be polarizing, but it’s utterly captivating and worth a try.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company 30 year old (distilled at Macallan),,Single Malt Scotch,604,"Ebony colored whisky with dark aromas of dense fruitcake, fresh fig, Medjool dates, sultana, and Christmas spices of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon, though a struck-match note lurks within. The treacle-thick palate has Coca-Cola, clove, aniseed, eucalyptus, sultanas, leather, blackcurrant, black cherry, dried fig, and raisin. The currant-bun finish is tannic and woody; tastebuds flinch and recoil. This is a grizzled old-timer best left to adventurous souls.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Cambus) 24 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,62,"Nearly a quarter of a century since Cambus Distillery closed, select casks are still being bottled by the independents. Grapefruit peel, fruit teas, lemon zest, mixed spice, cardamom, and wild garlic make for an intriguing nose. A sweet taste of sugared almonds, lemon bonbons, strands of candied peel, bananas, and vanilla, before the spices stomp all over the sweetness. Hot, dry, spicy finish with just a lick of butterscotch.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
85,Stalk & Barrel Corn,50.0,Canadian,36,"This 5 year old corn whisky is blended with mature rye and single malt, creating a soft and creamy dram with flickers of grain dust and smatterings of spice. Pleasantly hot with sweet spices and fruit market aromas. Very pleasant esters, hints of acetone and pepper, it fades into corn syrup and traces of cinnamon. More woodiness would raise the score.

85,Westland American Oak Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,70,"Floral and spice, including orange blossom and clove, this pours berry fruit on the palate before the chocolate malt balls set in. Seamless, nicely done, and certainly moreish, as the clean, drying finish gives way to biscuit, brioche, and <em>pain au chocolat.</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
85,Mars Iwai Tradition,40.0,Japanese,55,"Prunes, barbecue seasonings, and hoisin sauce, sweetened by rich caramel; soak up the heady aromatics. Gloopy texture on the palate explodes into life with burnt orange, dried mango, and banoffee pie, spiraling down to black licorice, burnt oak, and Brazil nut. The name acknowledges Kiichiro Iwai’s role in ushering in whisky making for Hombo Shuzo in the 1960s, drawing on the notes diligently recorded by Masataka Taketsuru in Scotland.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
85,Brothership Irish-American Whiskey 10 year old,45.0,Multinational Whisky,50,"Grassy, grainy, and floral on the nose, with hints of citrus, grape soda, and apples. The palate is creamy, fruity, sweet, and light, with creamed corn, milk chocolate, and grassy and floral notes. There’s a hint of spice and a milk chocolate finish. An interesting flavor profile, but the blend of bourbon and Irish single malt whiskey never quite comes together as a cohesive whole.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2017
85,"Oola Discourse Three Shores Whiskey Black Label French Oak, Cabernet Barrel Finished",47.0,Multinational Whisky,70,"A blend of Highlands scotch, Canadian whisky, and high-rye whiskey from Seattle’s Oola Distillery, with an additional year of aging in cabernet sauvignon barrels. The wine influence is apparent, with plum, cherry, and raspberry on the nose. French vanilla, dusty oak, white chocolate, and stone fruit dominate a creamy and mellow palate. Poached pears, honey, and cornbread flavors bring a little too much sweetness and lack depth.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2017
85,WhistlePig FarmStock Crop 001,43.0,Craft Whiskey,90,"Bright and lively, with violets, plenty of fresh oak, and traces of mint and pine, leading to a palate of butterscotch, bright citrus, warming spice, and sweet vanilla with drying and dusty cocoa. There is a glimmer of youth, expected given that 20% of this blend is their own distillery-made rye, aged less than 2 years. It’s an exciting glimpse of what’s to come, but the younger rye does little to enhance the great stuff they’ve been sourcing.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
85,Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Straight Rye,,Craft Whiskey,60,"Very aromatic and pretty, with floral lilac, violet, and rosewater notes that follow through on the palate like a grandmother’s kiss. The perfumed soap and sachet qualities are underscored by oaky contributions of vanilla and crème brûlée. Perhaps not for everyone, but this shows another thoroughly enjoyable side of rye whiskey.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
85,Sir Edward’s Smoky,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,22,"This blend delivers just enough peat turf to live up to the name, without alienating the peat phobics. A pleasant nose of chocolate hazelnut, pecan nut, dried tropical fruits, and gentle wood and peat smoke.  Orange, toffee, banoffee pie, Kola Kubes, and a little spiciness. Plenty of flavor even if the mouthfeel is a little thin. A short finish with a spicy flare and a few lingering smoky embers.

85,Duncan Taylor 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,70,"A toasty and spicier interpretation of an 18 year old blend. Toffee, salted pecans, Dundee cake, and sultana aromas. A beautiful, thick texture replete with ripe red fruits, cardamom, fennel, and star anise. Caramels drift past on a river of spice, wreathed in a fine layer of smoke, then oak, mixed nuts, and cracker bread. The fruity sweetness is momentary and fleeting, leaving the front of the mouth loaded with spice.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
85,Duncan Taylor Five Star,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,17,"It begins innocently enough. Ripening strawberries, cotton candy, and fudge on the nose, but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness. Soft mandarin citrus, vanilla fudge, sponge cupcakes, and a decent wedge of malt form the core of the palate; the spice is disappointingly mild considering the potential of the first sniff. Sweet and syrupy finish. Still, solid enough to make your world better at the end of a hard day.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
85,Buchanan’s Deluxe 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Overlook the fact that this bottle is saddled with one of the most impenetrable closures known to mankind. Unperturbed, this blend flaunts its big toffee aromas, whole almond, and floral top notes. With light fudge and gentle orange influences, it is smooth and rounded, top loaded with spice and hazelnut at the front of the mouth. More grain character and roasted spices show through on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
85,Buchanan’s Master,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,45,"This adheres to the rules laid down by blender Keith Law. The nose yields mint toffees, cereal notes, butterscotch, and whole peppercorn. Juicy orange, with elements of burnt orange, dark toffees, and a pleasant balance of sweetness form the palate, followed by a wave of peppery spices and late dashes of dates and sultana. The finish has more peppery spice and peppermint. Obey the Law.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
85,Bond & Lillard,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Delicate and flavorful chocolate, caramel, and dried fruit begin a delightful sipper that really becomes easy drinking, with hints of cola, cherry, and maple syrup. Then it’s the spice, specifically cinnamon and allspice, over a slight bitterness, like grapefruit rind, that suggests complexity awaits. But no, the short finish hurts its next-level consideration. Price is per 375 ml",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
85,Two Lanterns American Whiskey 4 year old,43.0,Craft Whiskey,120,"An intriguing whiskey, this smells like a flat, warm beer that was so good you still want to drink it the next day. Triple distilled from Samuel Adams Boston Lager, the hop notes are quite identifiable and really work well, imparting citrus, pine, and floral aromas. The palate is medium-bodied, with marshmallow sweetness, stone fruits, guava, and passion fruit, sprinkled with sea salt. Unusual, yet delicate, lively, and almost refreshing.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
85,Brenne 10 year old 2016 Release,48.0,Single Malt French Whisky,100,"Brenne has a fruity, vinous demeanor unlike anything else on the whisky market, and this year’s bottling deploys a greater use of Cognac barrels. Ripe honeydew melon, poached pear, strands of lemon and mandarin, and warm, creamed rice pudding. Mandarin segments in watermelon juice liberally sprinkled with pepper, then some fudge-like sweetness emerges, barbed with fennel. The French oak spices persist into the finish, heaping on the pepper and licorice.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
85,A.D. Laws Four Grain Straight Bourbon Cask Strength (Barrel #48),57.0,Craft Whiskey,78,"An intense nose offers complexity with minty herbal notes, licorice, fresh-sawn oak, and peppery spice at the forefront, giving way to pithy orange peel on the palate. With a bit of water to subdue the punch, this becomes impressively smooth and fruity, revealing sandalwood aromas and offering a lovely, long finish of candied orange and sweet chocolate-covered cherries. 60% corn, 20% wheat, 10% rye, 10% barley.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
85,The Cooper’s Croze,43.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,70,"Master cooper Ger Buckley has the most significant job at Midleton. Named after the croze that he uses to cut the groove for the cask head, these older-aged whiskeys give his rendition a broad back of toasted oak, vanilla pods, and cracker bread, with dark sultanas from the <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks. This has a richer, warm, glossier mouthfeel, showing toffee, vanilla, lump charcoal, and black fruits. A shadow of bitter oak creeps in toward the dying moments.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
85,Jameson Round,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,38,"This final lesson in the Deconstructed Series teaches us of the cask influence of the wood. The nose is warm and inviting, with toasted oak, rich vanilla, and bruised orchard fruit in a cider press. Sipping is rewarding: caramelized apple, oily pot still spiciness, toasted coconut, crunchy oat bars, cinnamon bark, dark treacle, pecans, and plump raisins. The creaminess of vanilla custard develops with dilution. If you’re late for final boarding, this is the one to grab. (<i>Travel Retail exclusive</i>) €36",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
85,Bowmore 9 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,37,"The latest addition to Bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. Matured predominantly in <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks, with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. The result is a whisky featuring drinking chocolate, black pepper, and soft peat on the nose. Sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate, with dates, plums, and light caramel. Smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Glen Scotia Distillery Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,119,"This is the third single cask Distillery Edition cask strength. It was distilled in December 1996 and bottled as a 20 year old in April 2016. Coconut ice and vanilla fudge on the very sweet, confectionery-led nose, with a suggestion of salt in the background. Full and supple on the palate, with a big hit of ripe apples, then cinnamon and nutmeg. Very long in the finish with light black pepper. A Glen Scotia for those with a sweet tooth! <i>(Distillery only bottling) </i>£95",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Lagavulin 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,135,"This is the fourteenth 12 year old Lagavulin bottling in the series and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. Vanilla and wood smoke on the early nose, then black pepper, lemon, marine aromas, and scented notes, with a hint of peaty yeast. Big, sweet, and direct on the smooth palate, with milk chocolate and black pepper, while the smoke keeps building. The finish is long and smoky, with persistent pepper. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Linkwood 37 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,900,"This is a 1978 veteran from the rebuilt Linkwood Distillery. The nose is slightly musty, even bitter, with sawdust and apple peel. The palate is sweet, with a suggestion of sherbet ‘fizz,’ elusive peatiness, and fruit spice, plus vanilla, walnuts, and ultimately, slightly grippy oak. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (6,114 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Littlemill 25 year old Private Cellar Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,3000,"This bottling of 1990 whisky from the demolished Littlemill Distillery was initially matured in ten American and European oak casks before being married and finished in first-fill <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks. Boiled fruit sweets, subtle vanilla, red apple peel, and cereal on the nose. The palate is rich, sweet, and full. Intense fruitiness, then fruit spices, hazelnuts, and some oak notes. Very long in the finish, with aniseed and plain chocolate. Mildly tannic at the last. Complex and satisfying. (1,500 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Cù Bòcan 2005 Vintage,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"The latest vintage expression of Tomatin’s peated Cù Bòcan was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Fishy smoke on the nose, with ripe red apples, toffee, milk chocolate, and malt. Creamy mouthfeel; ripe pears in peat smoke, sweet spices. White pepper, plain chocolate, and a lick of licorice in the relatively long and lively finish. (11,400 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Tullibardine The Murray,,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Distilled in 2004, The Murray was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is offered at cask strength, non-chill filtered. The nose opens with confident, sweet fruit notes—overripe bananas and peach slices—with background milky coffee. Rich and sweet on the palate, developing vanilla spices, chewy tropical fruits. The finish is long, with cinnamon, licorice, and oak tannins.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,Auchroisk 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,450,"Distilled in 1990, this rare expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. Quite shy on the nose, even at cask strength. Ultimately, faintly floral notes, with pear drops, vanilla, and linseed. Very smooth on the palate, with soft fruity malt, vanilla, peach, and dark berries. Buttery mango and nutmeg in the finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (3,954 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
85,The Sovereign (distilled at North British) 25 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,80,"Green grapes, fresh apple, caramel, wood spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, and digestive biscuits show the freshness of this quarter-century dram. Before the alcohol grips, sweet corn flavors and acidic-citrus fruitiness present themselves (a North British characteristic). A pleasurable, thick-textured taste of cookie dough, lime, lemon, orange Jell-o, and oak spices. A sparkling citrus finish dances on the tip of the tongue. Water discharges the taste of artificial sweeteners, so buck up and take it as it comes. (<i>K&amp;L Wines Exclusive</i>)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
85,Cadenhead’s Indian Corn 26 year old,,Canadian,160,"Like many older corn whiskies, this one unfolds slowly. Strong Cadbury caramel bar and slightly meaty, with sour fruits and cedar on the nose. Sweet and hot, with floral notes and initially a discordant touch of perfume. Pulling tannins provide structure for glowing pepper, sultanas, sweet spring flowers, some earthiness, and a touch of wet slate. Not as woody as most whiskies this age; a testament to long maturation in used barrels. <i>(</i><span class=""s1""><i>Cadenhead’s exclusive, Great Britain and Europe</i></span><i>) </i>£128",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
85,Barr an Uisce 1803 10 year old,46.0,Irish,80,"To stand out in the increasingly crowded marketplace of sourced, single malt Irish whiskey, you need a good, original hook: this whisky is cut with Wicklow water. Shhh! Don’t tell St. Kevin. The bourbon casks have developed a sweet, honeyed nose with fresh hay, peach pit, and some mature oak characteristics. Lighter weight than the blend (<i>see below</i>), it relinquishes golden honey, satsuma, ground ginger, crystal sugar, and tame spices. Pleasantly drinkable and incontestably well-made, but the liquid needs greater individuality.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
85,Redemption Barrel Proof Rye 8 year old,,Rye Whiskey,100,"Think of an herb garden. It’s pronounced with herbs such as parsley, dill, and hints of basil and mint. Fruits develop (canned peaches and pears), followed by earth, floral, and oak. Then a medicinal note sets in, forming as cherry cough syrup, striking an unbalanced, astringent mouthfeel with hints of mint and salted chocolate. A drop of water softens the medicinal approach and returns the herbal, fruity, and earthy richness. Finishes medium with a hint of dill.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
85,Bowmore 1999 vintage PX Hand-Bottled,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"The mid-priced Fèis Ìle release took Bowmore off into darker than usual territory. The key here was how the cask (PX is, after all, as sweet a sherry as you can find) had been so well controlled. Rather than being a thick, sweet mess, a balance was struck between the two elements: the cask added density and raisined fruit, while the distillery gave aromatic smoke and orange, and both combine to layer on molasses, leather, and dark chocolate. A success. £100",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
85,Edradour 9 year old 2006 Barolo Cask Matured (Batch 5),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"This expression of Edradour was distilled in April 2006 and was the fifth batch to be matured in Barolo wine hogsheads. Fruity farmyard aromas, spice, then developing heather honey, soft oak, and caramel. Earthy fruit notes on the palate, with walnuts, malt, and pepper. Mildly mouth-drying in the medium-length finish, with aniseed and black pepper. (2,000 bottles) £50",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
85,Ledaig 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,115,"This 18 year old variant of Ledaig from Tobermory distillery on Mull was released in spring 2015 and is finished in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. Old warm leather predominates on the early nose, with salt, pencil shavings, a suggestion of asphalt, and dried fruit. Big fruit and spicy peat notes on the robust palate, which features sherry and a sprinkling of brine. Drying slowly, with licorice and marginally tannic oak behind persistent smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
85,Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2016 (distilled 2010),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The annual (albeit limited) Loch Gorm release allows you to chart Kilchoman’s development in sherry casks. Here, first-fill and refill sherry casks (<em>oloroso</em> to be precise) were used. The latter seem to have more of a say, as the distillery character is more apparent: sweet fruit, marine smoke, and clementine, before the golden raisin from the cask develops. The palate is smokier and also more overtly sherried. A bolder style, but very well balanced. Limited, so get in there ASAP.",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
85,Limeburners Sherry Cask,61.0,Australian Whisky,169,"Brace yourself: the marauding alcohol vapors will slap you across the chops within inches of the glass. The finishing vessel, a small sherry cask, exudes sweet red fruits; Fragola Fabbri candied strawberries, stewed apples, and brandy characteristics. Diving in neat, become immersed in a sweeping intensity of fruity plum, crabapple, and fig. Taming with water unlocks flavors of honey, caramel, green fruits, and vanilla, though it retains that plum leitmotif throughout. Finish of black pepper on stewed fruits. A$220",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
85,Stalk & Barrel Red Label Blend,43.0,Canadian,31,"Raising the bar a little higher, Still Waters is introducing Red Label, a blend that is rich in 100% rye, all-corn, and single malt whiskies. The undisclosed base whisky is sourced, the rest made in-house. Luscious with sweet esters, lilacs, white clover blossoms, oak sugars, vanilla, and a brace of warming spices. Round, mouth-filling, and creamy on the palate, and after a second, pleasing rye spices emerge. Hints of barrel notes with glowing pepper and citrus pith. Mix or sip. C$40",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
85,Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice 1997 (distilled at Tomatin),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Matured in refill bourbon barrels, this Tomatin is softly floral on the nose, with sweet fruit spices, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. The palate is fresh and fruity, with cream, milk chocolate, and nutty spice. Fruity to the end, notably ripe apples and red berries, plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
85,Box The Early Days (Batch 002),,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,140,"Two-thirds malt smoked with Scottish peat, the remaining third is unpeated Viking malt, all filled into first-fill bourbon quarter casks, achieving 30ppm. Peat smoke, lobster pots, pine forests, smoked fish, and some zesty lemons. A beautiful, dense texture of candied peel and sweet lemons; smoke flaring briefly before dying back to a honeyed conclusion. Water picks out an almond and nougat note with lemon sherbet. If you are new to Box, this is a fantastic place to begin. (2,000 bottles) €124",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
85,Trail’s End,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"An 8 year old Kentucky straight bourbon finished in Oregon oak that apparently brings about vanilla cake batter, caramel, hints of coffee, and citrus. Soft and delicate to the taste, with exploding French toast notes, cinnamon, allspice, and a hint of blueberry jam. The finish comes and goes, but leaves an impressive watermelon Jolly Rancher-cinnamon combo at the end. This one is meant to be sipped without the addition of water or ice. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
85,John Myer New York Straight Rye Single Barrel,45.0,Craft Whiskey,42,"Fresh oak, sweet malt, caramel, and spiced cherries flirt with cracked pepper on the nose, while the smooth and sweet palate offers up clean flavors of citrus zest, butterscotch, drying oak, and saddle leather. Pleasantly herbal and licoricey on the palate with a perky cinnamon-spice finish. Nicely executed. 70% rye with certified organic grain. 375ml",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
85,Two Brewers Yukon Release 03 Peated,46.0,Canadian,74,"Distilled and matured under the midnight sun in Whitehorse, Yukon, Two Brewers whiskies benefit from having a brewery to keep the cash flow positive during the 7 year maturation period, and a brewer to manage the fermentation flavors. Peat smoke, freshly-washed hospital garments, antiseptic—typical Islay with a lot more fruitiness. Sweet canned fruit cocktail and persistent smokiness all wrapped together in a neatly-balanced unit. Hot peppers, hints of green licorice, and caramel. C$95",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
85,Auchentoshan Blood Oak,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"A non-chill filtered bottling matured in a mixture of bourbon and red wine casks. The nose offers a big early orange hit, vanilla, and red wine notes. Smooth on the palate; more orange, black pepper, and spicy red wine.  The finish is relatively long and spicy, with bitter chocolate orange. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
85,New Southern Revival Sorghum Whiskey,44.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Is it whiskey? Sorghum’s a grain, but sorghum syrup is pressed from the stalk of the plant. But HighWire Distilling uses Muddy Pond sorghum syrup, which mashes the grain in with the stalk. So…we’ll say yes, whiskey. Spritely on the tongue: lively and quick, sweet but spicy with oak, and not an off note. Crying for a cube and a shot of seltzer. Whiskey? Probably. Good? Yes!",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
85,Two Brewers Yukon Single Malt Release 2,46.0,Canadian,72,"Canada’s sub-arctic Yukon Territory has become fertile ground for making whisky. Blended from a mix of barrels distilled in 2009, then finished in Pedro Ximenez sherry barrels, Two Brewers Release 2 shows multi-layered complexity. Lovely sherry notes meld into rich malty grain. Sweet and warming, with tinges of sandalwood, apples, and exotic fruits. Silky mouthfeel, finishing on the vaguest notions of wildflower honey and wintergreen<em>. </em>(<em>Canada only</em>) C$95",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
85,Caldera Hurricane 5 (Batch 0001),40.0,Canadian,26,"Caldera Distilling of River John, Nova Scotia sits across Northumberland Strait from Green Gables, Prince Edward Island. Its namesake whisky is made in a tiny alembic still from grain grown right on the distillery property, then blended with rye whisky from Alberta. Fruity, with oak caramels, burnt firewood, herbal tones, and glowing peppery spices. Mild vanilla, citrus pith, buttery fudge, and a long warming glow in the chest. (<em>Canada only</em>) C$34",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
85,The Quiet Man,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,40,"The man in question was John Mulgrew, an unassuming Belfast bartender who kept his counsel and told no tales. Blended and bottled in the wonderful city of Derry, this is a first-fill bourbon cask-finished whiskey brimming with honey, gentle vanilla, banana chips, fresh florals, dusty ground pepper, and Chinese five-spice. It delights on the tongue, with sweet golden syrup, a satisfying nuttiness, and corn. A smooth finish with a whimper of spices wrestled into submission.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
85,A.D. Laws Secale Straight Rye,50.0,Craft Whiskey,75,"Same specs as the Secale Rye Single Barrel<em>.</em> Grassy nose, spicy hard candy, hot mint, and split-rock dryness. Dry rye grain, a tweak of bitterness, and alcohol heat. Finish is a bit oily/sticky. Good example of the modern MGP-inspired rye interpretation: grain-forward and no-nonsense.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
85,Balblair 1999 (2nd release),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"This Balblair vintage replaced the previous 1997 bottling, and maturation took place in a mix of bourbon barrels and sherry butts. The nose offers milk chocolate, candied ginger, caramel, honey, and musty oranges. Relatively dark fruits on the palate, with licorice, honey, and vanilla. A medium to long finish, spicy, with slight oakiness.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
85,The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1985 30 year old (Cask #612),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Here, the distillery character is more restrained, as if it is taking a period of calm reflection before the next evolution. There’s slightly more maltiness here and the texture has changed into a light acacia honey stickiness and a development of more oxidized notes, showing a gentle maturation. It’s one I kept going back to; teasing, slightly elusive, but rewarding. £1,300",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
85,Glen Garioch 1797 Founder’s Reserve,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,46,"The entry level, no age statement expression of Glen Garioch, offered at an unusually high ABV for a single malt in this price range.  Grapefruit , lively spice, vanilla, malt, and black pepper on the nose. Milk chocolate, chili, cooking apples, and something slightly savory on the palate. Citrus fruits and lots of spice in the relatively lengthy finish. An unusual and pleasing dram for the money. £32",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
85,Laphroaig 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Now you see it, now you don’t. Brought back like Frank Sinatra for last year’s 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, here’s Laphroaig in gentle Islay sunset mode, all soft fruits and oils. There’s typical marine-like smokiness of course—particularly on the palate. I’d go neat with this to observe what is rather excellent balance. And snap it up, who knows when there will be another?",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
85,Wemyss Malts The Hive,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,54,"Having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions, Wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. Fortunately, the nose of light honey, lavender, heather, and spring blossoms confirms that it’s business as usual. Melon, mango, passion fruit, and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet, fruity profile. Gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. It’s crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. Still a crowd pleaser. £37",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
85,Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel,52.0,Rye Whiskey,60,"This non-chill filtered rye is bold and ready for a spice-hungry palate. At first the aroma gently introduces herbs, pepper spice, cinnamon, and vanilla; preparing for a hopeful taste of the same. Instead, there’s a surprise: toasted rye bread at the beginning followed by cinnamon and caramel, with a medium-length finish.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
85,Stalk & Barrel Single Malt (Cask 52),46.0,Canadian,70,"Aromas of halva, dry hay, poached pears, and apple pie. The palate is sweet and full, with ripe cherries and a certain earthiness along with dusty grain and aromatic wet hay. Peppery heat enhances hot ginger and cinnamon hearts. This is malt whisky, held together by strong cereal notes with a fruity, creamy, medium finish. It’s already tasty at 3 years; one wonders what glories another 3 would bring.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
85,Gordon & MacPhail 8 year old (distilled at Pulteney),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"Offered in the ‘Distillery Labels’ series by Gordon &amp; MacPhail, this expression from Wick’s Pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when Gordon &amp; MacPhail was its principal bottler, and 8 its standard age. Aged in refill bourbon barrels. Soft fruits, dried grass, and faint wood smoke on the nose. Smooth and nutty on the palate, with smoky spice, a sprinkling of salt, and ripe pears. The finish is medium in length, mildly peppered, nutty, and oaky.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
85,Kininvie 23 year old (Batch 3),,Single Malt Scotch,173,"As if making up for lost time, wee bottles of Kininvie are popping out every month. This is a fine demonstration of the distillery style which sits—appropriately enough—between the lightness of Glenfiddich and the fruity sweetness of Balvenie. Here, flowers are to the fore, along with <em>creme anglaise</em>, and a light herbal edge. There’s some weight to the palate, but very little oakiness. A perfumed finish akin to elderflower maintains the frothy floral aspect. A perfect spring dram. £120",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
85,Spirit Works Straight Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Aged 2 years, 1 month in 53-gallon charred oak barrels, it&#039;s straight. So&#039;s the nose: green, herbal and oily with rye, and backed by oak. Mouth is honest: youthfully zesty rye flavors, grassy freshness, oak and alcohol warmth, and a savory rye finish. Nothing gets in the way of a pure experience. Good young rye.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
85,Woodinville Straight Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Good bourbon nose—oak, corn, allspice, a little sweet citrus—but some solvent notes flitting around too. Feisty in the mouth; warming, punchy oak, softer pillow-thumps of corn, and some bitter rye notes. More rye comes out as it sits. Finish is long and warm. Good young bourbon; priced like a good older bourbon. Craft still presents some hard choices.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
85,Jack Ryan 12 year old,46.0,Irish,65,"The Ryan family has been running the Beggars Bush pub in Dublin since 1913, and historically they bottled their own whiskey. This is enticingly sweet from the bourbon wood, with taffy candy, vanilla cream, and peeled orange. The warm, fruity flavors encompass sweet orange, lime, and pineapple before a wave of honey and maltiness rides in with an undercurrent of Kendal mint cake, though the fruit persists. Satellites of citrus around drying oak make the finish. Solid, composed, and decent.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
85,Pendleton Midnight,45.0,Canadian,35,"Beginning with dried orange peels and steely rye that smells like a creek bed, the nose slowly develops light fruit, caramel, and vanilla fudge. Finally, pears, sweet plums, and raspberries emerge. On the palate, Midnight erupts into glowing hot spices, citrusy sweetness, dark fruits, candied ginger, and mildly grassy prairie sage. The heat and sweetness build into plummy sweet and sour sauce with vague hints of barrel notes. The long finish is unusually spicy.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
85,Famous Grouse Mellow Gold,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,33,"This has enticing flavors that will meet with the approval of the regular Grouse drinker: heady florals with fresh peach, light honey, pecan, and underlying caramel. The palate is soothing with vanilla and tangerine, hallmarks of Grouse, plus rosewater, almond, and whispering spices. Gently does it, that’s the key to this: kick back and relax. This showcases the Midas touch of Gordon Motion’s skills in liquid alchemy. A great value blend to boot. £22",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
85,Dewar’s White Label Scratched Cask,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,26,"What lies beneath the surface of Dewar’s? Here, the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred, then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents, a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla, light lemon, milk chocolate, and sweet toffee, ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label, this is less obviously sweet and creamy, adds complexity, and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly, this is up to scratch.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
85,Balblair 2004 Sherry Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,83,"Balblair has released two Travel Retail-exclusive variants of its 2004 vintage, matured in bourbon barrels and sherry casks respectively. The Sherry Matured version was aged in American and Spanish oak sherry butts. It is only available in Asia. Oriental spices, soft leather, and damsons on the nose. Milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight in time. The palate features lively spices, cooking apples, vanilla, medium-sweet sherry, and hazelnuts. Spices persist in the finish, with honey and raisins.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
85,Edradour Ballechin 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"After eight no-age-statement releases of Edradour’s heavily-peated Ballechin, the brand finally comes of age as a core product. It is bottled at 10 years of age after maturing in a combination of bourbon barrels and <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. Earthy peat and fragrant spices on the nose, old leather, and faint toffee. The palate initially offers very fruity peat, then newer leather, aniseed, and plain chocolate, with lingering fruity peatiness. More plain chocolate and ginger in the smoky, medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
85,Edradour The Fairy Flag 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This expression was released to celebrate the Scottish feature film “Fairy Flag,” and after maturing for 8 years in bourbon barrels, the whisky then spent 7 years aging in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. Initially meaty with rich sherry, raisins, and cocoa powder, then increasing vanilla notes, plus warm leather and wood polish. Sweet and very spicy on the palate, with caramel, chili, and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length, with peppery plain chocolate. £65",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
85,Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015),,Single Malt Scotch,135,"As pale as you&#039;d expect, this year’s Special Release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet, bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. The smoke comes across very gently, allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. The palate stirs in some emulsion paint, a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise, and gradually deepens. With water there are more smoke and marine notes.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
85,Dry Fly Washington Wheat,45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Wheats have a fruitier nose than bourbons, it seems, and this is no exception. Gentle, almost delicate fruits on the nose: white grapes, honeydew melon, baked apple. So smooth on the palate: sweet pastry, light baked apple, a nice oak grip keeping it all together. Sip it straight, or build a big highball with just a splash of soda on the ice. Such a friendly whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
85,Cedar Ridge Malted Rye,43.0,Craft Whiskey,38,"Sharp, even a bit of a sour edge, and some stemmy grass. Sweet and chewy grain in the mouth, with a nice touch of oily rye bitterness, some hot oak that quirks the tongue a bit, then a finish that melts into creaminess.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
85,Cody Road Single Barrel Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,45,"A wheater, 70/20/10 corn/wheat/malt, barrel proof, and 32 months old. A rich corn nose, with some wood notes and a slightly antiseptic sting of alcohol heat. Young in the mouth—cinnamon candy, a bit meaty—but all the right pieces are in place: warmth, corn, oak spice, and a smooth progression to the warm finish. Good already, and showing even more promise.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
85,Wigle Straight Rye,,Craft Whiskey,62,"Organic Pennsylvania-grown rye, 3 years old, pot-distilled a 20-minute walk from the Monongahela River. Nose: sharp rye and hard oak, floral wreathing, but not hair-crispingly hot. Oh, nice rye mouth, flavorful, not overly bitter, the oak’s held in check, and there’s a minty sweetness to it. Finish is well-tempered, until a note of perfume sneaks in at the end.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
85,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 2005,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Initially very ozonic, fresh, and marine. So much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. Everything is very restrained, some cold-smoked fish, mineral, and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. That mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced, and at its best neat.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
85,Duncan Taylor Octave (distilled at Glen Grant) 1995,,Single Malt Scotch,151,"The impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. Here, Glen Grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist, with some bodega notes, blackberry, and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. The palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. A pleasing dram. £99",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
85,Pittyvaich 1989 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015),,Single Malt Scotch,400,"Good to see Pittyvaich back in the Special Release roster. Here we have the heavy, nutty character of the distillery given full expression. The emphasis here is on a mix of nuts, cake mix, and dense fruits: even a little hint of cigarette tobacco. When neat, the palate has real density that is enlivened by water, which brings out fresher—and decidedly more green—notes. Worth a dram.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
85,Usquaebach 15 year old,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"The blended malt in the series is drawn from select aged Highland single malt whiskies chosen by Stewart Laing. A luxuriant nose of rich, runny caramels, deliciously malty, and balanced with notes of dried apple, mixed peel, and pecan shells layered over warm spice. Smooth, with a light to medium body showing toffee apple, raisin, and caramel, tasting fatter with time and yielding pineapple notes. A finish of soft, sucked toffees and tingly spices. A top-class, well-executed drink.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
85,Kinahan’s Blended Irish Whiskey,46.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"They say that Jerry Thomas made Kinahan’s his whiskey of choice in 1862. A sniff today might reveal molten honey, flapjacks, dry grist, and a fresh apple Danish (apple, custard, and pastry). The palate has a nip of lozenge sweeties, more apples, peppermint, vanilla, and a slow slide into chocolate, lemon pith, and cocoa. The 25% malt content presses home the flavor. Palate-coating. It’s a blend of fine quality, and Kinahan’s revival adds to the resurgence of Dublin’s whiskey story.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
85,Glen Breton 14 year old,43.0,Canadian,101,"The warehouses at Glenora are not heated, so aging virtually stops in winter. Thus, the whisky doesn’t reach its peak until its mid-teens. By then, it is malty, fresh, crisp, and grassy, with hints of vanilla and delicate, slightly bitter fruits, including apricots and citrus pith. Fragile floral notes join exotic hints of mango and a nuttiness reminiscent of almond skins and sweetened coconut. <em>Air do dheag slàinte, Glenora</em>, as they say in Cape Breton’s Gaelic Highlands. <em>(Canada only) </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
85,Auchentoshan Cooper’s Reserve 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, this expression of Auchentoshan was aged for 14 years in a mix of bourbon and <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. It is not chill-filtered prior to bottling. The nose yields polished oak, malt, milk chocolate, marzipan, figs, apricots, and ginger. Rich and full on the palate, spicy, with vanilla, mango, and finally Seville oranges. Medium to long in the finish, with almonds, soft oak, and warming spices.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
85,Benromach 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"A new member of the core range, this has a cinnamon spice nose with wood smoke elements that grow into hickory as it opens. There’s also sandalwood, citrus, and dried fruits. Medium-bodied and juicy, there’s light sherried notes on the tongue, alongside perky acidity, especially with water. The smoke has better integration on the palate, allowing tangerine and sultana to come through. G&amp;M’s aim has always been to make a classic pre-60s Speysider, and that’s achieved here.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
85,Glen Scotia Heavily Peated 10 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,76,"Higher in strength than the standard Glen Scotia 10 year old, this heavily peated expression is part of the distillery’s Legends of Scotia series, and celebrates Campbeltown&#039;s historic Picture House. Just 6,000 bottles. Fruity peat on the nose, with lots of apricot and peach notes. Finally, fresh cigarette ash. Voluptuous in the mouth, and fruity, then sweet spice and drier peat notes develop. The finish is medium to long, with spicy tar. €70",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
85,Glenfarclas 105,60.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Brimming with distillery character. Gentle malty notes come through initially, accompanied by apple core and classic ‘Farclas weight. The alcohol, though high, is not obtrusive. In time there’s some orange marmalade, and this bittersweet element helps to add another layer of complexity. Water brings out toffeed depth. Even neat it isn’t too hot, showing heft rather than bludgeoning power. In time there’s black cherry, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Highly recommended.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
85,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Aultmore) 6 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,85,"Remarkably rich color, indicative of a first-fill cask. A clean if hot nose with carpenter’s workbench, Comice pear, and lots of oak. Aultmore’s acidity comes through on the palate, with its zingy intensity cutting through the wood and achieving a certain balance. The palate shows a mix of fruit and wood sugars. Young certainly, but bottled at the right time given the intensity of the wood element. Water makes it more sappy and summery. Not hugely complex, but fun.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
85,Wigle Organic Wapsie Valley Corn,46.0,Craft Whiskey,58,"The first bourbon made in Pennsylvania in over 25 years, using locally-grown, organic Wapsie Valley dent corn, which comes in yellow and maroon; a 1 year old bottling. The aroma is distinctive: deep mint, clove, and red plum. Warming and sweet, then broadening on the palate, the corn becomes prominent. Finish is hot, but tasty. This is a young one, with promise.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
85,Glendalough 13 year old,46.0,Irish,100,"The oldest release yet under the Glendalough name, this bourbon cask whiskey brings forth a nose of lush caramels, malt, milky hot chocolate, nutmeg, with herbal notes hovering at the periphery. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and reassuringly malty. After an early spice kick, there is grapefruit, with mint eventually taking charge. Fizzy, effervescent candies pop on the palate and tongue. A medium-length finish, the mint diminishing to leave cinnamon and a little charred oak. A fine discovery.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
85,Kinsey Rye,43.0,Rye Whiskey,28,"Bright grainy rye in the nose, bitter and green, with contrasting streak of sweet cola. Quite balanced in the mouth; the rye is more savory and saves the bitter spark for the finish, the sweetness less obvious, the body neither featherweight nor heavy. That’s really not bad at all. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
85,Chivas Regal Extra,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"A new <em>oloroso</em>-forward Chivas positioned to split between the 12 and 18 year olds? I got this. Refined and inviting nose of lemon pith, black fruits, and Kola Kubes. The velvety texture is wonderfully smooth, redolent of an apricot custard Danish, lime zest, raisin, currant, mixed peel, and walnut, with a growing bitter-lemon note. Quite unique finish, like sucking on lumpy Spanish lemons speckled with spices. (<em>LA, NY, Miami, Chicago, Northern California, but will go national</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
85,Glenkinchie 2000 Amontillado Finish Distillers Edition,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Bottled in 2014, this expression of Glenkinchie was distilled in 2000 and finished in <em>amontillado </em>sherry casks. The <em>amontillado </em>gives a more rounded feel and greater profundity to the single malt. Peaches, apricots, almonds, and soft ginger on the nose, Smooth and balanced on the palate, gently spiced and nutty, with cherries, caramel, discreet sherry, and vanilla. The medium-length finish features vanilla and lingering, spicy Jaffa oranges, drying slowly to oak. £63",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
85,Cù Bòcan Limited Edition Virgin Oak,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,73,"Cù Bòcan is the lightly-peated variant of Tomatin single malt, and while most Cù Bòcan is matured in a combination of sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks, this expression was exclusively aged in virgin oak. Fragrant on the nose, with lemon, lanolin, vanilla, poached pears, and peppery rye notes. Rich spice and vanilla on the palate, zesty and warming, with apple pie, and caramel. The finish is medium in length, with spiced fresh oak. <em>(Worldwide except U.S.) </em>£50",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
85,Oban 1999 Montilla Fino Finish Distillers Edition,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"This vintage edition of Oban was distilled in 1999 and finished in <em>montilla fino</em> sherry casks, which lend a greater richness and complexity to the Oban house style without detracting from its essential characteristics. It was bottled in 2014. The nose is fragrant, with musky pineapple, and salted caramel. Silky on the palate, with Seville oranges, ginger nuts, and cloves, plus a faint suggestion of brine. Persistent orange and dry spice notes in the oaky, medium-length finish. £75",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
85,High West Double Rye Single Barrel (cask #1097-2),50.0,Craft Whiskey,47,"Traditionally, this release has been a showcase for the raw power and spice of both young and old rye. In this single barrel release, the spice and fire have been considerably tamed by deep caramel, vanilla, and sweet corn. The spice is still there, with oak, rye, and cinnamon, but is no longer the star. The proof shows up in the finish, which is long and quite dry. An understated expression of one of High West’s flagship releases. Sourced whiskey. (<em>Drink Up New York only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
85,Wemyss Malts Toffee Tuile (distilled at Aberfeldy) 1999,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,129,"Following on from another 1999 single cask Aberfeldy in the previous batch of Wemyss Malts’ releases, we have Toffee Tuile, matured in a hogshead. The nose is sweet and approachable, with tinned fruit cocktail, vanilla, malt, and fresh ginger. Tropical fruit, brittle toffee, hazelnuts, a hint of caramel, and more ginger on the nose. The finish is medium in length, fruity, and mildly spicy. (393 bottles) £88",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
85,Jim Beam Pre-Prohibition Style Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,23,"The old Beam rye never got a lot of respect from aficionados. It’s been pulled, reformulated, and repackaged. Let’s try it. Smell: sweet grass and pepper. Taste: hot, flashy, sweet on top, with rye oiliness underneath, a tickling bitterness that blends well with oak into the finish. The higher proof plays well, giving this a punch of flavor the old yellow label didn’t have, and at a good price. It’s Manhattan time! Value Pick",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
85,Spirit of Hven Seven Stars #3 Phecda,45.0,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,90,"Willingly, we travel further along the Big Dipper with whisky maker Henric Molin. His latest creation exudes rich, dark, chewy toffee, Brazil nut shells, chopped dates, licorice, stone fruits, grilled beef mushrooms, and worked leather. The flavor starts slowly, like trying to ignite a fire of damp twigs. Once established, there is good weight and density, with treacle, dried fig, black cherry, and cinnamon, but the finish diminishes quickly after swallowing, leaving blackened oak and burnt sugar. 795 SEK",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
85,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Dailuaine) 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,66,"Dailuaine is a fascinating distillery and this has a fascinating nose, as it shows a heavy sulfury new make entering maturity and starting to pick up extra weight from the cask. There’s a glimpse of sweetness, a little fruit, but the dominant character is a savory meatiness (beef stock cubes). The palate shows dried mint and masses of this meaty/sweet interplay. Is it commercial? Probably not, but it tells a really important story. I like it a lot. £45",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
85,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Auchroisk) 11 year old 2003 (cask #9),,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Most of Auchroisk&#039;s malt goes into Diageo’s J&amp;B blended, so a single malt release is an uncommon treat. Aged in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a nutty, roasted malt nose. On the palate it’s soft and lush, with honeyed roasted malt, walnut, ginger, and salt. A spicy mid-palate leads to a dry finish that abandons a lot of the flavors established. A solid mix of flavors, but the finish shows why it&#039;s often used for blending. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
85,The Lost Distilleries Blend (batch 6),,Blended Scotch Whisky,512,"The sixth incarnation of Master of Malt’s cult blend of closed distillery whiskies contains Port Ellen, Brora, Mosstowie, Glenisla, Imperial, Caperdonich, and Glen Mhor with grain whisky from Port Dundas. Apples and sugar browning in a pan, smooth driftwood, and dairy fudge, but with the Glenisla it’s noticeably smokier than earlier batches. Sweet <em>blancmange</em> initially, before it soars to a tangy, spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper, ground ginger, peanuts, and florentines. Smokin’ liquid history. (534 bottles) £350",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
85,The Lost Distillery Company Gerston (batch 2/1),46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,65,"A pale primrose of a dram. Waxed lemon, salted butter pats, white peach, honey, and the wood smoke from green stems. A sip brings Highland toffee, honey, chocolate fudge, rich tart fruits, with dried apple, raisin, mixed peel, and a late appearance of malt, pepper, and smoke. It wraps up with a glossy, clingy finish, but it’s short. Experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle, pralines, and fudge to the surface. Overall, a very decent drop.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
85,Old Forester 1870 Original Batch,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"The first release in the “Whiskey Row” series. Nicely balanced flavors with a youthful kick. Fairly straightforward in profile, with plenty of spice (cinnamon, clove, mint, and nutmeg), citrus fruit (orange, tangerine, grapefruit), and honey vanilla. Dry, spicy finish. A little rough around the edges, but otherwise an enjoyable whiskey.",John Hansell,Spring 2015
85,Arran Malt Orkney Bere,,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Isle of Arran Distillers has introduced a second edition of its Orkney Bere expression, made with an ancient variety of barley still cultivated in the Orkney Islands and aged in bourbon barrels. It is a cask strength 10 year old variant, and 4,890 bottles are available. The nose is quite oily, with ripe peaches and pineapple cubes, plus developing floral notes. Viscous and sweet on the palate, with tangerines, caramel, and rich spices. The finish is lengthy, with coconut and milk chocolate-coated caramel.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
85,Bunnahabhain Ceobanach,,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This is master blender Ian MacMillan’s interpretation of what Bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. There’s light smoke, coming across like smoked halibut, a mineral edge, white fruits, and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. Water brings out almond. On the palate, the smoke offers a slightly peppery, almost Talisker-esque kick. Light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. Though there’s no age statement, none of the whiskies are under 10 years. £46",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
85,Glengoyne Teapot Dram (Batch 3),,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Named in honor of the copper teapot from which distillery workers were ‘drammed’ until the 1970s, this distillery-exclusive bottling has been matured in first-fill <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose is fruity and fragrant, with profound spicy sherry notes. Mouth-coating, with lots more sherry, plus prunes, drinking chocolate, and a little oak. Lingering in the finish, with drying sherry, light spice, and dark chocolate. A great dram for lovers of a true sherry monster! £60",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
85,Wemyss Malts Peaches and Cream 1989 (distilled at Glen Garioch),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,133,"This 25 year old single cask bottling of Glen Garioch from Wemyss was one of a dozen released in late 2014. The hogshead in which maturation took place yielded 357 bottles. The nose gives apple, banana, vanilla fudge, nutmeg, and soft spices. Creamy and nutty on the palate, with a squeeze of lemon, soft toffee, and milk chocolate. The finish is medium in length, spicy and nutty, with cocoa powder and just a suggestion of smoke. £87",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
85,Wemyss Malts Summer Fruit Cup 1998 (distilled at Auchentoshan),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,107,"This is the Lowlander among Wemyss Malts’ dozen single cask releases for the fall of 2014. Maturation took place in a bourbon barrel, which yielded 295 bottles. Tinned peaches in syrup, caramel, mild vanilla, and damp tweed on the nose. Medium-bodied and intensely fruity on the palate, with apricots, raspberries, and ginger. Fruit notes linger in the finish, with spicy milk chocolate. £70",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
85,Big Bottom Barlow Trail Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,30,"Big Bottom has made their name finishing sourced whiskeys. Now they’re experimenting with a blend of undisclosed whiskeys in a bourbon base. The result is a riff on Canadian-style whisky. Dark gold in color, the nose is light oak, caramel, cinnamon, and cherry. On the palate it’s a pleasant mix of creamy vanilla, oak, and cinnamon. A medium finish features light charred oak and black pepper spice. A unique approach to the style, one that manages to really work.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
85,Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Rye French Oak Finish (Barrel F2-038),45.0,Canadian,65,"Fruity with dried dates and figs, peaches, peach pits, purple plum pits, and hints of black licorice. Tingling cloves and ginger add zip to traces of bitter chewing tobacco. Powerful, firm, and drying with pulling tannins like a fine Bordeaux. While this is gorgeous whisky in its own right, the French oak flavors have overwhelmed the familiar clean, spicy, fruity base of the original Masterson’s on which it was built. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
85,Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean Infused,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,70,"Chopped vanilla beans were added to barrels of Bowman bourbon (in varying amounts); the barrels were married after 24 months and bottled. The nose has soft vanilla and sweet orange; it&#039;s almost soothing, balm-like. Vanilla is not at all overpowering in the mouth, but shows more as a richness around the edges. Otherwise, a good, sprightly bourbon with a nice citrus and oak finish; like to try this in a cocktail.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
85,Wigle Wheat White Ash (Small Cask Series),46.0,Craft Whiskey,27,"Wigle’s also doing a series of finishing experiments with the addition of honeycombed wood chunks to their organic wheat whiskey; this one uses white ash. Sweeter nose than the straight-up wheat whiskey <em>(see below)</em>; mouth is cleaner, and the astringency I noted on the end is ameliorated. All a matter of degrees though; quite similar to the regular wheat whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
85,James E. Pepper 1776 Rye,50.0,Craft Whiskey,27,"Big mint/grass nose with sweet grain and a touch of vanilla behind it. Fiery, slippery with rye oiliness, popping with that mint, and rye-bitter on the finish; a bit of a bully. That&#039;s not all bad, though; too many ryes strive to be smooth these days, but this lets it rock, and does it well. A chunk of ice doesn&#039;t hurt this at all. Potent, bold. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
85,Wyoming Single Barrel Bourbon (#1056),44.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Wyoming Whiskey (Kirby, Wyo.) is making bourbon from Wyoming grain, on a column still, aged in full-sized barrels...in the Wyoming climate. Minty, grassy, meadow-varied plants; a bit of cedar and old clothes. Mouth is fuller, with more corn sweetness and balance than the small batch <em>(see below)</em>. Notes of sweet citrus, rye punchiness, and that cedar flit by quickly in the mouth, and the finish is long and smooth. Much preferred over the small batch.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
85,Jura 1984,44.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This Jura expression was distilled in 1984 and matured in bourbon casks for 22 years before a further 6 years in Gonzalez Byass Matusalem sherry butts and 2 years in Amoroso and Apostoles <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. The nose opens with beef gravy, soon followed by prunes, cherries, dark chocolate, and PX sherry. Full-bodied, rich and sweet on the palate, with lively spices, and more cherries, and chocolate. Long and fruity in the finish, with spicy sherry and licorice. £750",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
85,Bruichladdich Octomore 7.2,,Single Malt Scotch,191,"Also distilled in 2009, this is mid-gold in color and medium weight, with a mass of sage-like smoke. More cask influence than 7.1, with smoked coconut, and again a mix of sweet fruits and lemon behind this smoky lead. Oily and rich, but a little fragmented on the tongue; the elements are beginning to cohere to produce integrated complexity. Octomore in mellow mood, with smoked chestnut and a little farmyardy Pinot note. Another positive work in progress report. £125",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
85,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (2014 release) 12 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"This whiskey’s signature over the last several years has been wood dominant, with plenty of dried spice (the exception being the 2013 release which I really enjoyed—it was chock full of balancing sweetness). The 2014 release is similar to the pre-2013 releases, with dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla) and dried citrus on a soft bed of maple syrup, caramel, and honey, leading to resinous oak grip on the finish. A dynamic bourbon, but still leaning heavily on the oak spice.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
85,Octomore Islay Barley 2009,64.0,Single Malt Scotch,239,"An interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry, or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. Overt smoke is in check when neat. In the mouth, however, it comes through massively, mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. Thicker and more farmyard-like than Port Charlotte. Great potential, with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
85,Glen Garioch Single Cask #990 1998,,Single Malt Scotch,115,"A 15 year malt selected by the Loch &amp; K(e)y Society. Hard apple cider leads the nose and is backed by honeyed malt and cinnamon-baked pear. The entry is lush caramel apple, but quickly transitions as the sheer power and spice of the mid-palate comes crashing in with oak, ginger, and pine. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with lingering heat. This is the kind of big, bold, dry whisky that American whiskey drinkers might enjoy. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
85,Glenrothes Sherry Cask Reserve,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,88,"Bold, with a slightly blunt entrance. The cask influence is to the fore, mixing rum and raisin with a slight yeasty/dough-like edge that sits alongside caramelized fruits. In time, there’s sweet draff, malt loaf (with butter), and the smell of old cupboards. It gets creamier with water. Medium-bodied with a light savory note in the middle that then drifts toward Brazil nut, and Assam tea. A solid performer. Bristol Milk sherry rather than old <em>oloroso</em>. £55",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
85,Littlemill 21 year old Second Release,47.0,Single Malt Scotch,207,"This is a distillery bottling from the now-demolished Lowland plant of Littlemill, near Glasgow, and the release consists of 4,550 bottles. There has been no chill filtration. Fresh pineapple and mango on the nose, inflated balloons, a hint of vanilla, and cocoa powder. Medium-bodied, with focused tropical fruits, ginger, and caramel. Lengthy in the finish, with gentle spice and milk chocolate-coated toffee. £130",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
85,Old Pulteney 35 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,815,"Just 450 cases of this veteran expression from Old Pulteney have been released, offered in non-chill filtered format after maturation in a mixture of bourbon casks and Spanish oak sherry casks. Light fruit notes on the nose, notably tangerines, plus vanilla, lemon, and sea salt. Orchard fruits, spicy sherry, worn leather, and cocoa powder on the silky palate. Spicy and drying in the finish, with mild oak tannins.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
85,Cuatro Series Oloroso,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"The nose opens with savory notes. Richer, more fragrant and profound sherry than is present in the Fino or Manazanilla expressions. Full-bodied, with big, musty sherry notes and Seville oranges on the palate, plus lots of spice. Gum-tingling spices, with sultanas and dates in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
85,Wemyss Malts Melon Vine 1994 (distilled at Aberfeldy),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,143,"This 20 year old single cask release from the Perthshire distillery of Aberfeldy runs to 242 bottles, matured in a hogshead. Apricots, green apples, ginger, and icing sugar on the nose. Soft fruits, notably peaches, gingery oak, and more icing sugar on the palate. Milky coffee, caramel, and eucalyptus in the slightly oaky, medium-length finish. £90",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
85,Nikka 12 year old,43.0,Japanese,44,"This blend is soft and quite sweet, with low levels of spice and that characteristic Nikka richness behind, a classic fist in a velvet glove. Ripe, round, and generous, there’s cocoa and butterscotch, with plenty of persimmon and nutmeg. Lush, round, and balanced; a classic Japanese blend. This will become the core blend in the range, and should be appearing in the U.S., hopefully, in 2015. ¥5,000",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
85,Low Gap Blended Whiskey 2 year old,46.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Warm, delicate vapors curl from the glass: dry grain, sweet orange peel, honey candy, but all of it ethereally light. Quick in the mouth, makes other whiskeys seem heavy with wood. Sweet grain is the base of the structure, with a skin of soft citrus candy and custard notes. Wood is mostly present as a lightweight frame, almost like a zeppelin framework containing delicate volumes of flavor. This is craft, charting a new course.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
85,Stillhouse Red Hot Moonshine,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,28,"True to its name, the nose is exactly Red Hots candy along with a touch of corn underneath. The entry is soft cinnamon, but it quickly ramps up to fiery Red Hots candy. The proofing here matches the flavor precisely, for a pleasantly spicy but not overly fiery mid-palate. The finish is short and cleans up well with light lingering cinnamon left behind. A good balance of sweet and spicy, and a solid offering for the genre.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
85,Sons of Liberty Pumpkin Spice,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,49,"The aroma is rich with pumpkin pie notes and a strong citrus component. There’s eight tons of actual pumpkin in the year’s run of this seasonal; impressive, and you can smell the roasted gourd. The whiskey’s not sickly sweet as feared, but more like a homemade, sugarless pumpkin pie, almost savory. The flavor is solid, rich, and integrates well. For what it is, it’s done well, and it’s done boldly. I’d maybe back off the orange a bit.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
85,Broger Distiller’s Edition,,Austrian Whisky,104,"A rich, sumptuous nose of deep, oxidized sweetness derived from storage in 128-liter madeira barrels, this cask strength Broger has wafts of fallen orchard fruit, gooseberry fool, young rhubarb stems, and lime curd. It’s thick, chewy, and syrupy, wallowing in flavors of toffee apple, deep vanilla, and stewed fruits, though with a dash of water, some brown bananas and coffee cream notes peek through. A fabulous nose, but the palate is pulled toward an overripe, fruity profile. (164 bottles) €84",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
85,Aultmore 12 year old,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"Aultmore is normally light and estery, and this pale dram is true to this. After a whiff of fresh turmeric, there’s an almost oily green note with William pear before acetone, and something akin to school Bunsen burners (a good smell) emerges. The palate is more coherent than the nose; sweet, rounded, and more substantial that you expect, with tinned pears in custard. Lively and charming; shows none of the firmness of youth suggested by the nose.",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
85,Darkness! (distilled at North British) 18 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,111,"This North British has been led astray; well, subjected to three months’ confinement in first-fill <em>oloroso</em> sherry wood. Such are the ways of Darkness! There’s a savory nose of peppered filet, mustard seed, and tarragon. Interesting, but not to everyone’s taste. The creamy texture consists of evaporated milk, strong caramel, dark toffee, and black currant granola, though that savory character persists. Water pumps up the cream, raspberry, and cereal notes until it sees daylight, becoming almost a breakfast whisky. £70",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
85,Uisce Beatha Real Irish Whiskey,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,29,"This is straightforward, straight shootin’ Irish whiskey. Creamy country fudge, toasted muffins, glorious sweet malt, waxed lemons, and delicate spices on the first sniff. It’s light in the mouth, with lemon curd, juicy caramels, and vanilla custard tarts: simply bursting with warmth. It concludes with spices twinkling on a malt theme. Have your Irish whiskey experiences only been with the big names? Go live a little. You ought to get this: sugar and spice and all things nice.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
85,Adelphi (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1989 25 year old,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,265,"Pale gold, with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond, light bread crust, and freshly-baked sponge cake. In time, there’s Starburst sweets. Some heat, even at this relatively low strength. There are mineral accents and, with water, the signature ginger. The palate is very sweet and soft with jelly fruits. Clean and supple, especially with water. Zesty, with a refreshing acidic balance.",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
85,Glenglassaugh Torfa,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,67,"<em>Torfa</em> is apparently Old Norse for “turf” or “peat,” and this no age statement Glenglassaugh was made using malt peated to around 20 ppm phenols. Heathery peatiness on the early nose, with dried fruits, malt, and cream soda. Ultimately, leathery, mellow smoke. Sweet and lively on the palate, after an initial flavor of coal soot, with ripe peaches, chili, and ginger, backed by floral peat and a hint of ozone. Spicy peat smoke in the relatively long and fruity finish. £40",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
85,Glenturret 26 year old 1986 (Hunter Laing/The Glenturret),,Single Malt Scotch,505,"With only a 10 year old house bottling of Glenturret available, brand owners the Edrington Group have collaborated with independent bottler Hunter Laing to produce this ‘semi-official’ 26 year old expression, matured entirely in refill bourbon casks. Pineapple, dates, honey, and hard toffee on the floral nose. Full-bodied, waxy and chewy on the palate, with vanilla, ginger, cherry liqueur chocolates, and dark spices. Lengthy in the finish, with emerging bitter chocolate notes. £300",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
85,Kornog Taouarc’h Kentan 14 BC,46.0,French Whisky,79,"If you cannot wait for Jean Donnay to start distilling at Gartbreck on Islay, console yourself with this Celtic whisky made by the sea, with malt peated to 35-40 ppm. The nose has hard, dry peat, cold charred logs, and heather twigs, but enough creamy sweetness to keep it buoyant. It shimmers and twists on the tongue, showing shades of light and dark. Nuts, treacle, licorice, and raisins emerge, though the structure shows its youth. Dry, sooty finish. €60",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
85,Master of Malt Reference Series III,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,178,"With the majority of the blend coming from older single malts, this forms a counterpoint to I and II (see below). Toasted spices, fennel, black peppercorns, cocoa, malt loaf, split orange peels, and salted caramel invade the nose. The palate is a gluttony of chocolate. Beneath, look for dried fruits, macchiato, peanut shells, and some tannic bitterness as the older malts show their wares. It leaves a cocoa finish without the sweetness. A great concept for self-educating your palate. £106",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
85,Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 20 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,85,"Situated between siblings Barterhouse and Old Blowhard in flavor profile. Firm spice, botanicals, dried fruit, and a kiss of honey rest on a bed of caramel, along with resinous oak, leather, dark chocolate, and a hint of tobacco on the finish. Lovely nose, but there&#039;s substantial oak on the palate. The sweeter notes make an effort to balance the oak, but the oak still dominates. For these who like drier, spicier bourbon.",John Hansell,Fall 2014
85,Basil Hayden’s,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,42,"Interesting that the label says “Artfully Aged,” yet there’s no actual age statement. Lively nose, good rye snap and spice, a bit of mint and oaky edge. Not hot, well-behaved on the tongue, and happily gives back everything taken on the nose. Sweet, spicy, and easy to like, this is whiskey without flaw, well-done and tasty, if not overly ambitious or challenging.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
85,Ransom The Emerald 1865 Batch 1,,Craft Whiskey,90,"Made from an Irish whiskey recipe from 1865 (“dug up” by David Wondrich), with malt, raw barley, rye malt, and rolled oats, distilled in an alembic pot still. Amber with a distinct red/pink cast to it. Very fruity nose—greengage plum, mulberry, sweet orange—with creamy vanilla. Tastes of sweet cereal with a firm bitter keel; the fruit returns as an echo in the finish. A very craft beer-like whiskey; challenging, interesting, unexpected. A bit brash, but worth investigating.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
85,The Irishman Single Malt Batch 1703/2013,40.0,Irish,70,"The Walsh Family releases 6,000 bottles in every small batch of their single malt. Each bottling is a combination of triple distilled whiskey matured in <em>oloroso</em> sherry and bourbon casks. The nose is bright with vanilla icing, butterscotch, and dried peach. The taste is quite active, with honey, cinnamon, gingerbread, ground almond, and dark chocolate. There is a brief flat spot where the bitterness burns through, before it fades to leave a pleasing tickle around the gums.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
85,Jefferson’s 10 year old Batch 18,47.0,Rye Whiskey,40,"Whiffs of whole cloves quickly turn to cedar shavings, acetone, menthol horse liniment, corn syrup, and German rye bread. Brighter and fresher than other 100% ryes, but somehow a bit muddied with a grainy, earthy, wet-clay mealiness. Searing spices turn rye drinking into an extreme sport. Leather, peppermint, sweetish rye grain, and firewood gradually emerge. A blistering finish pulls like tannic black tea, while underlying rye grain notes drift along forever.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
85,Edradour 1999 Natural Cask Strength cask #295,,Single Malt Scotch,118,"Distilled on June 20, 1999 and bottled in November 2013, this expression from the Perthshire distillery of Edradour was matured for 14 years in a sherry butt. The outturn was 687 bottles. The nose is notably sweet, with jammy aromas —strawberry and raspberry— while hazelnuts and walnuts lurk in the background. The same fruit and nut notes from the nose carry over, along with sultanas, candied peel, Jaffa orange, and spicy leather. The lengthy finish is viscous and gingery. £70",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
85,Lagavulin Triple Matured Edition,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"A very laid-back start with the sweetness of the sherry cask bringing a fat, figgy, dried fruit aroma which initially suppresses the peat, only allowing a little pipe smoke and smoked meat to emerge. With water, there’s balsam, tar, dried seaweed, and fabric Band-Aid. This is repeated on the tongue, with dark fruits suddenly changing to spent kiln and bonfire ashes, but there needs to be more cohesion between the elements. £80",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
85,Chichibu On The Way,,Japanese,245,"Lifted, quite estery and delicate, with fruit blossom, preserved lemon, and light minerality. It needs water; when added, out burst blossoms, brioche, and fondant icing. On the palate, there’s a frothy pink party going on: marshmallows, flowers, raspberry, and cream. Water adds silkiness, while the finish throws out yuzu, then tightens in the manner typical for a young whisky (it’s 3 years old). Not only on the way, but getting there. ¥25,000/700 ml",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
85,Ranger Creek .44 Rye,47.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"A new Small Caliber Series bottling, distilled from 100% rye. Nose gives rye dough, mint candies, and a push of rye oil and crushed grass. Punchy and perky on the tongue, hot and spicy young rye character with black pepper and bitter rye slicing through a sweet body; quite dynamic. Ranger Creek makes exciting whiskeys, for sure, and this one shows an increasing talent for balance. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
85,Spirit of Hven Seven Stars No. 2 Merak,45.0,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,124,"Henric Moulin is a passionate ‘grain to glass’ whisky maker who established Sweden’s third pot still distillery in 2008. This 25-cask batch puts up a nose of cantaloupe, green grapes, fruit syrups, Black Jack candy, kid leather, and a whiff of peat smoke. Soft in the mouth, it’s peppery, with herbal notes, slabs of vanilla fudge, and a little milk chocolate. Water adds a dash of creaminess, but it’s preferable neat. The wax-dipped bottles will appeal to Maker’s fans. €90",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
85,Stalk and Barrel Cask 10,46.0,Canadian,64,"Ontario government retailer LCBO bought this barrel for an exclusive bottling, and it’s a doozie. The first nose is all fresh flaxseed before peppermint, anise, and sweet fragrant flowers waft in. A few minutes later the nose morphs into peach cobbler with lingering suggestions of dry grain. Cooked peaches sustain the palate until sweet spices arrive, bringing hints of oak and creamy barley sugar with them. There’s lots of action in this whisky glass. (<em>Ontario only) </em>C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
85,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Dalmore) 17 year old cask #0080,,Single Malt Scotch,152,"This Dalmore single cask variant was distilled in October 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead, which yielded 139 bottles in January 2014. Freshly-mown hay, then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. Nutty caramel in time. The palate features Terry’s chocolate orange, vanilla, and nutmeg. Citrus fruits and malt in the finish, with hazelnuts and a hint of oak. £90",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
85,Signatory (distilled at Cameronbridge) 1995,43.0,Single Grain Whisky,44,"A pale grain from the colossal Fife distillery, released at 18 years old as part of Signatory’s Vintage Single Grain Collection. Vanilla icing, digestive biscuits, pumpernickel, toasted coconut flakes, crushed cumin seed, and a background note of fresh mint are apparent. The vanilla and blossom honey flavors are in union with the buttery, lightweight texture, and there’s a pulsating spiciness that lives on in the finish. A refreshing alternative. £26",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
85,Glen Deveron 20 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,152,"The nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling, with less spice and succulent fruitiness. A hint of nougat, but overall, drier and ‘quieter.’ The palate is silky, with walnuts and allspice, while fruit notes are provided by plums. Following the overall theme here, the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant, featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. Relatively lengthy. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £90/liter",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
85,Broger Triple Cask,42.0,Austrian Whisky,66,"Austria now boasts more than a dozen distilleries. Combining maturation in fresh bourbon, sherry, and Madeira casks can help younger whiskies like this to combine different flavors. The Madeira and sweet sherry dominate the nose initially, but there are dried cherry, fresh fig, marzipan, and shelled pistachio too. It’s a smooth, light to medium-weight dram with good maltiness, ground almond, latte, dry sherry, milk chocolate, apple, and baked pears. The long finish leaves raisins and a coffee-bean intensity. €48",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
85,Sortilège,30.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,28,"According to the maple syrup geeks who make Sortilège, Quebec’s sugar maple forests produce their sweetest, woodiest, most robust flavors in the early days of the late-winter syrup season. This maple whisky is proof positive. Creamy sweet, slightly peppery, leafy in a good way, and richly imbued with woodsy maple, Sortilège stays firmly in the whisky camp, though just downwind from the sugar shack. Like maple syrup itself, it leaves the palate slowly. Price is per 375 ml.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
85,Redemption White Rye,46.0,Rye Whiskey,20,"Very grassy, with dry earth and pink peppercorn layered in, but none of the heat you’d expect from unaged 92 proof rye. Very well-behaved on the tongue; oily, bittersweet, with the 95% rye mash rolling like an unhurried river, one long, smooth wave of rye flavor. A whiskey like this could be called too simple, but this is strikingly single-minded. A likely candidate for cocktails at the price.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
85,Johnnie Walker Explorers&#039; Club Royal Route,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,159,"I had to double check that price. My feelings are well recorded on premium whiskies bottled at 40% and if you were to ask me whether the whisky&#039;s worth the price tag, the answer&#039;s no. That doesn&#039;t make it a bad whisky, though; far from it. It has a light, dusty, and fruity nose reminiscent of raspberry sherbet, and on the palate there is trademark smoke, and pleasant toffee and treacle. Good, but in stellar company here. (<em>Travel Retail only</em>) Price is per liter.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
85,Jefferson’s Presidential Select 30 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,250,"A thick, heavyweight bourbon. Older doesn’t always taste older, and this 30 year old Jefferson’s tastes younger than its sibling 25 year old. The influence of 30 years in oak is evident with its polished leather, tobacco, and charred oak. However, there’s a surprising sweetness that props up the oak with maple syrup, blackberry jam, cinnamon roll, and vanilla cream. Very even-keeled. Yes, it tastes old, but with redeeming qualities. Dark and mysterious in personality.",John Hansell,Spring 2014
85,Bw3 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This is quite a saline Bowmore, but there is sufficient sliced apple, cut flowers, and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. With water you get crisp oak, roasted barley, a hint of nectarine, bison grass, and wet reeds. Starting lean in the mouth, it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. Slightly muted, but well balanced. £60/500 ml",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
85,Lagavulin 37 year old,51.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is a venerable Lagavulin which immediately shows its age with a nose that mixes the savory (hoisin sauce) with the mature notes of dunnage warehouse, sandalwood, and a minty lift. In time, there’s bog myrtle, old attics, rain-moistened wool, and a smokiness akin to a dead briar pipe. Slightly dull to start, it perks up in the mid-palate with lanolin and black olive brine, and a Darjeeling-like grippiness. Interesting for sure, but past its best. <i>(1,868 bottles)</i>.",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
85,Lg4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Lagavulin),,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Hard not to compare this to the 12 year old, as they are of similar strength and character. This is more about the peat bank rather than the shore, more eucalyptus than kelp. This pungent, earthy note is retained with water, alongside some brine. The palate is like carrageen moss pudding, with a touch of nutmeg at the end. Plenty there, but it all moves very quickly when I want it to linger. That said, a solid performer. £47/500 ml",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
85,Noss Head,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,67,"This expression has been matured entirely in bourbon casks and offers a fresh nose of ozone and lemon, becoming quite fragrant in time. More mouth-coating than might be expected, yet easy drinking, with milk chocolate, malt, tropical fruits, and an edge of sea salt. The finish is medium in length, with wood spices. £40/liter",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
85,Canadian Club Black Label 8 year old,40.0,Canadian,33,"In the 1980s, when white spirits elbowed whisky aside in the marketplace, unneeded barrels of Canadian Club continued aging. Japanese whisky lovers delighted by the resulting flavor boost demanded a new Japan-only CC. Sweet and hot, the classic pruney, figgy fruitiness of Canadian Club interweaves with new cedar fence posts. Vaguely pulling tannins lend a bitter edge that first amplifies blistering hot pepper, then muffles it into the soothing, glowing warmth of bubbly ginger ale. (<i>Japan only) </i>¥ 3,375<b> </b>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
85,Wood’s Tenderfoot Whiskey (Batch #3),45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Here’s something interesting: all-malt, but not all barley malt, there’s some rye and wheat malt as well. The rye pokes through as fresh grassy notes, struggling with the young barrel character. Detonates on the palate: spice, fudge, vanilla, grain, and oak. This is brash, loud stuff, broad-shouldered, insistent, and cocky. Could find favor with the hophead clan of craft beer drinkers. You’d think it could use some taming, but given a chance, its boldness is appealing.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
85,Compass Box Great King Street Experimental TR-06,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,48,"One of two blended whiskies vying to be the official next Great King Street release, this is the peated version and it's gustier than the original, with less citrus and more peat. Indeed, it's impressively full-flavored, with peat in the driving seat and ginger cake, lime, and dark chocolate, biscuits and pepper in the mix. Best of all, unlike far too many Scotch whiskies this year, it doesn't use peat to hide immature spirit. £30",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchentoshan) Batch 2,,Single Malt Scotch,101,"Batch 2 runs to 295 bottles and, in common with the rest of the range, carries no age statement. Peaches in brandy, ginger, honey, and milk chocolate on the pleasingly floral nose. The palate is silky, with more floral notes, plus cedar, oak, and soft spices. Almonds and allspice in the medium length finish. £63/500 ml",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
85,Glen Garioch Virgin Oak,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,120,"The Aberdeenshire distillery of Glen Garioch has released its first ever virgin oak-matured expression, which has employed heavily charred American oak barrels. According to master blender Rachel Barrie, “Glen Garioch’s intense flavor means it holds up well in a new fill cask.” Ripe peaches on the nose, spicy oak, vanilla, and more soft, floral notes in time. Malt, milk chocolate, nectarines, nougat, and mild cloves on the palate, while the finish is medium in length, with ginger and lively oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
85,Tomatin Cù Bòcan,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Named after a mythical hellhound that is said to stalk the area around Tomatin distillery, Cù Bòcan is lightly peated and matured in a combination of virgin oak, bourbon, and sherry casks. Just 60,000 liters are produced each year. Lemonade and coconut on the early nose, with developing almonds. Slightly earthy, with soft smoke. Rich, full mouthfeel, malt and honey, with the smoke more evident now, plus cinnamon and cloves. Nutty. Lingering oak and dry peat smoke in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
85,Cadenhead’s (distilled at	 Auchroisk) 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Pale, with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom, almond icing on a custard cake, and even a little candy floss. All very aromatically intense, with quite a hot focus on the tongue. With water you keep the concentration and add in lemon, jellied fruits, and light, dusty spiciness.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
85,Leopold Bros. Maryland Style Rye,43.0,Craft Whiskey,44,"Maryland, Monongahela, and, I guess, Modern are the American rye styles. Maryland was a gentler rye, less spicy, and not as hot/sweet as modern rye. This has the dry-grass spice of rye, a hint of cocoa powder, and a bit of funk that blows away to hints of fruit. Light and clean on the palate, some sweetness that rapidly dries out in a grassy, herbal wave. Intriguing, without being overwhelming.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
85,Chichibu Chibidaru 2009,,Japanese,152,"<i>Chibidaru</i> is a Japanese slang term meaning “small,” which is appropriate given the size of the cask—quarter-size—used for maturing whisky from a <i>chibidaru</i> distillery. This has the intensity of youth with some lemon meringue pie, pomelo, and hint of night-scented stocks. As the nose suggests, this is a wee (<i>chibidaru</i>) sweetie with mouthwatering citrus character and soft-centered sweetness moving to mace, strawberry, and a popping candy finish. Akuto-san is making some great whisky. £95",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
85,Teeling Small Batch Grain Whiskey,46.0,Irish,55,"The Teelings were responsible for giving us the quite wonderful Greenore, which moved up the gears until it hit stunning at 15 years old. This, I suspect, is back to the start and is a work in progress. But it has all the right parts even if it isn't firing quite yet. Its nose is industrial and a tad sappy, but the taste makes up for it: sweet, light, with smoky ashtrays and almond pulp.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
85,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Glen Garioch) 17 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Distilled in September 1995 and matured for 17 years in a refill hogshead, this bottling of the Aberdeenshire malt Glen Garioch

offers a nose of fresh peaches and vanilla, followed by a sprinkling of chili powder, and even a suggestion of boiled ham. Voluptuous in the mouth, with summer fruits, toffee apples, and a significant amount of ginger. The finish

dries quite rapidly, with fruity spices. £60",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
85,Wemyss Malts Candied Fruit (distilled at Auchentoshan) 1998,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,95,"One of the batches of spring 2013 single cask releases from the prolific Wemyss Malts, Candied Fruit is a 15 year old Auchentoshan, and 294 bottles are available. An aroma of sweet shops, vanilla, and white pepper on the nose, becoming maltier, with dates, sultanas, figs. Apples and pears on the light-ish palate, with coconut and ginger. The finish is fruity<b>—</b>spicy

satsumas<b>—</b>and finally, drying. £62",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
85,Jim Beam Signature Craft Rare Spanish Brandy Finish,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Quite the antithesis of the Signature Craft 12 year old, released at the same time. This one is finished in Spanish brandy barrels, so I expect it to be a polarizing whiskey. The brandy influence shows, with sweet fruit (sultana, honeyed tangerine, pineapple, ripe apricot) and spice (vanilla, cinnamon, ginger) interwoven with caramel. No age statement. Youthful, but not immature. A limited edition release.",John Hansell,Fall 2013
85,Big Bottom Bourbon (finished in Zinfandel casks),,Craft Whiskey,35,"Sourced whiskey, selected then finished by Big Bottom in Zin casks at their Oregon warehouse. Ruby glint to the whiskey, and a big, sweet, hot nose with a wine-side fruity slant to it. Wine’s more apparent

on the palate; there’s a bit of oak bite and red wine tang heating up the bourbon, which is broad, without obvious corn. The corn appears in the finish, which is firm and gripping. The Zinfandel finish is well-played here.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
85,Telsington IV 2012,42.0,Liechtenstein,,"Last time we reviewed Telsington it came with a warning. Everything from triple distillation, unusual ways of drying the barley, and through to Pinot Noir wine casks for maturation is designed to take you from your comfort zone. Not for everyone, we wrote. But this is a big step on. There’s an almost bourbon or rye quality to this. There’s burnt toffee and stewed red berries. Deliberately nothing like scotch, but we’re starting to see

what Marcus Telser is aiming for. €71",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
85,That Boutique-y Springbank Batch 2,,Single Malt Scotch,89,"That Boutique-y Whisky Company is an independent bottler noted for quirky and very contemporary label design. The whiskies carry no age statements. Springbank Batch 2 has an outturn of 450 numbered bottles. Initially, overripe pineapples and dry hay on the oily nose, cut by a sprinkling of salt. Brittle toffee, and finally, hand-rolling tobacco. The palate is very fruity; more pineapple, plus peach, developing peat, plenty of spice, and more tobacco. The finish is relatively long and slightly herbal. £58",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
85,Shieldaig 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,31,"This is a sharp dresser, with a firm, solid mouthfeel and an altogether finer and more focused taste than Shieldaig Classic (see

below). It’s not coastal or earthy particularly, either. Instead the flavors are softer and built around mocha, smooth creamy toffee, and some soft fruit, including a touch of overripe banana and melon notes. The savoriness this time comes from a touch of pepper rather than salt.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
85,James Brookes Blended Whisky,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,18,"This is like listening to a quiet and understated musician and slowly starting to realize that there are all sorts of clever

nuances just beneath the surface. This evolves from a floral and welcoming nose, through a saline note and on to pepper and a Highland earthiness, but wrapped up in a rich, honeyed body. A nice balance between the ruggedness and sweet softness. All rather pleasant.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
85,Downslope Double Diamond,40.0,Craft Whiskey,32,"More pale than other crafts I usually see; the whiskey is 12 to 21 months old and spends time serially in wine casks, medium toast American oak barrels, and finally “very experienced” French oak. Smell is

quite young, but clean, with notes of orange and rye grain, and a whiff of nutty toffee. Quite a lively mouth, with much more toffee, less orange, a hint of odd spice (cardamom?), and a twist of milk chocolate at the finish. Interesting stuff.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
85,Italian Single Malt Red,40.0,Italian,,"It might be Italian single malt, but it isn’t whisky. It’s getting there, though, and this is very sippable in its own right. This is from the far North of Italy, where the influence is heavily Austrian. It’s very well made indeed, is bursting with vibrant fruit, and is good enough now to be enjoyed as an aperitif. It will appeal to Italian palates, which are fond of very young spirits. €35",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
85,Jura Turas-Mara,42.0,Single Malt Scotch,61,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, Jura Turas-Mara takes its name from the Gaelic for “long journey.” It has been matured in an array of casks sourced from America, Spain, France, and Portugal. Initially, green apples on the nose, then sweet fruit notes<b>—j</b>elly babies<b>—</b>plus coconut and fudge. A little linseed in the background. Vanilla, peaches, mango, and lively spices on the palate. The finish dries, with aniseed balls, becoming slightly powdery. €50",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
85,Crown Royal Limited Edition,40.0,Canadian,,"Starts off sweet, followed by nutmeg, cinnamon, clean oak, and a zesty bitterness. This austere yet elegant whisky slowly develops a deep complexity. Silky corn and bourbon-like vanilla toffee override distinct suggestions of apple juice, as dusty rye along with hints of dry grass lead into mashy cereal notes. Finishes with tightly integrated flavors of white pepper, gingery spices, hints of fresh-cut wood, and hot peppermint. Lovely. (Canada only) C$37",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
85,Cardhu 12 year old,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The decline in the Spanish market has resulted in Cardhu becoming more widely available, which is A Good Thing as far as I am concerned. This is a grassy malt, which at 12 years also has a heightened citric spray of sweet orange zest and a gingery aspect (it’s great with ginger ale). Intense and vibrant with macadamia and a light heathery note, the palate confounds expectations, having a thick chewiness before the grass zings through, adding lift. ",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
85,Glenlivet 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,33,"As with the ‘Fiddich (reviewed in this issue), here’s a malt where an improved wood policy has brought a dram to life and added complexity. The Glenlivet has always been about lightness, but the trick is to have sufficient solid base to allow its flower to blossom, so as well as lily, orchid, and pineapple, there’s a thick creaminess that gently beds all of these flighty flavors down. With water, there’s mandarin and rose petal, and a sneeze of white pepper. Simply lovely. <em>Value Pick</em>",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
85,Creative Whisky Co. Exclusive Malts (distilled at Littlemill) 24 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The first Lowland single malt bottling to be made available in the U.S. by the Creative Whisky Co., this 24 year old cask strength, single cask bottling from the now-demolished Lowland distillery of Littlemill offers toffee, fresh pineapple, and sultanas on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous in the mouth; mellow, with vanilla, cocoa powder, and soft spice notes. Brazil nuts and old oak in the gingery finish. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
85,Tullibardine 25 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The oldest expression in the Tullibardine lineup provides malt, cedar, stewed apples, and wood shavings on the nose. Mouth-coating, with orange and cocoa powder. Dries quite steadily, with oak lurking behind ripe bananas in the lengthy finish. Another very accomplished old Tullibardine, but the notably pleasing palate of the 20 year old just gives that bottling the edge. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
85,Wemyss Malts Fruit Bonbons (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1989,66.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of four Spring 2013 single cask releases from Wemyss Malts, Fruit Bonbons was distilled at Glen Garioch in 1989 and bottled during 2012. The out-turn was 325 bottles. Homemade lemonade and a dash of table salt on the early nose, then heather, ginger, and finally the sweetness of icing sugar and fudge. Apples coated in cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, and dark treacle on the palate. The finish dries, from apple pie to oak and plain chocolate. £90",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
85,Douglas Laing Director’s Cut (distilled at Teaninich) 1982,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 30 year old bottling from Teaninich was distilled in December 1982 and matured in a refill butt. Just 201 bottles have been released from cask #9323. The nose is characterized by lemon curd, flat Coca-Cola, and spicy malt. The palate is smooth, sweet and fruity, with vanilla and stem ginger. Autumn berries and more ginger figure in the lengthy, slightly charred finish. £195",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
85,Thomson 18 year old Barrel No. 22,46.0,New Zealand,,"Mat and Rachael Thomson run a small, hands-on whisky business, moving toward a sizeable and successful whisky business. Truth be told, much of what's left from the Willowbank distillery is average. This isn't. It's an example of just how good the distillery could be, with citrus at its heart, plus gutsy and prickly savory notes and some salt and pepper to fill it out. Later on there's a trace of spearmint and even menthol. NZ$142",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
85,Nant Single Malt,43.0,Australian Whisky,,"This is a creamy, rich, refreshing departure from the more common styles of Australian whisky and it's ample proof that diversity will be a major part of the Oz story. This is milky chocolate and cocoa, almost like cachaça, with some soft violet and red wine notes, and—somewhat bizarrely—black currant sorbet. As I said about shouting Aussies above, this is anything but; a delicate, light-fingered exercise in style. A$125",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
85,Ranger Creek Rimfire,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A “mesquite smoked Texas single malt whiskey,” this is a distillation of Ranger Creek’s Mesquite Smoked Porter. If you’re expecting to get shot out of the saddle, surprise: the aroma is quite delicate, with light mesquite, malt, melon, and butterscotch. The mesquite strikes first in the mouth—ashy, drying, a bit medicinal—followed by the cooler, sweeter malt and melon, and a hint of the chocolate malts in the porter. Another good young (6 months) whiskey from Ranger Creek. Price is per 375ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt,54.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Have you ever noticed how some distilleries never appear under independent labels? They say they put a teaspoon of whisky from another distillery in each barrel; no longer a single malt. Whether they really do, who knows? So here is a blended malt with 99.99 percent of the whisky from one distillery. This has no peat and is sweet, honeyed, and rich, with vanilla, banana, lime sherbet, and tropical fruits. Almost certainly from Speyside…but where? £50",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
85,Westward Oregon Straight Malt Whiskey,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"All-malt, double pot-distilled, aged 2 years in new, charred, 53 gallon oak barrels. Nose has cereal and muted apple notes, some light grassiness, youthful. Exciting on the palate: hard candy, vanilla, oaky spice, hints of maple; it’s a jubilance that doesn’t end, but doesn’t get tiresome like some sugar-high toddler either. Finish is just more of the same, which is okay, but mildly disappointing. Well done, but quite pricey. Price is per 375ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
85,Wild Geese 4th Centennial Limited Edition,43.0,Irish,,"Grandiose name for a perfectly acceptable but ultimately tame and straight-ahead Irish whiskey. There are hints of pot still oiliness, and the expected green fruits are in place. But the only new trick on offer here is the fact that it is less sweet and cloying than its brand siblings, the apples are like baked apples filled with mincemeat, with nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix. Frustrating, in that it hints at greatness but doesn't follow through. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
85,George Dickel Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,25,"A 5 year old rye whisky made in Lawrenceburg, Ind. (with the signature LDI 95% rye mashbill) that went through the Lincoln County Process after aging. A somewhat anemic nose, lightly grassy; sweet with edges of mint, vanilla, and oatmeal. The mouth is more rewarding; the rye’s bitter spice and sweet mint emerge to flame across the tongue. It’s very easy to drink, with a flare of oily mint intensity at the finish. Good, but you expect more from Dickel.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
85,Auchentoshan Valinch 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,60,"This is the second edition of Auchentoshan’s cask strength Valinch bottling, which carries no age statement and has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. As with the previous Valinch expression, only 2,000 cases have been released globally. Very fragrant on the nose, with pears, applesauce, and vanilla fudge. Spice, cream, and lively Jaffa oranges on the palate. A touch of (not unpleasant) new make spirit comes through in the relatively lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
85,Douglas Laing (distilled at Glenturret) 18 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled in September 1994 and bottled at 18 years of age as part of Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series, this Perthshire single malt displays a nose of malt loaf, tinned prunes, white pepper, and a suggestion of soy sauce on the nose. Finally, much more floral. Peppery on the palate, with citrus fruit, gunpowder tea, medium sherry, and cocoa powder. The powdery cocoa notes persist in the long, spicy, discreetly oaky finish.  £80",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
85,Canadian Club Dock No. 57 Spiced,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"A judicious infusion of vanilla and spice bolsters cinnamon, pepper, caramel, and aged oak, while leaving the rye whisky character intact. Prune juice tinged with citrus fruit balances sour black licorice and earthy artist’s canvas. The palate has a creaminess, but with pithy, silky tannins. Burning hot cinnamon hearts and syrupy sweetness take us vaguely into liqueur territory. A complex nose, but a simple palate that soon fades into white grapefruit and a warming peppery glow. (Canada only) C$26",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
85,New Holland Beer Barrel Bourbon,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Another MGP/LDI-sourced whiskey: but New Holland finishes it in oak barrels that they’ve used to age their Dragon’s Milk imperial stout, an interesting reversal of the bourbon barrel-aged beers brewers are making. It gives a dark wood nose with cinnamon and hot fruit. The whiskey’s a bit light in the mouth but enticingly smooth, a flow of corn, wood, and anise that flares up at the finish in a nice rush of heat. Quite good…but not great. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
85,XXX Shine Salted Caramel,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Appropriately caramel-colored. The smell of caramel and taffy pushes out of the glass, but as you get closer, there’s the fresh green snap of clear corn whiskey laced through it like fruit in your dessert (with an authoritative boozy crack to it). Nothing’s overpowering on the palate — a swirling, balanced ride of sweet candy, fresh corn, and estery booze — but the finish sings a clear, pure note of…salted caramel. This could teach flavored vodkas a thing or two. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
85,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (bottled 2012),,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Honeyed citrus, vanilla, and hints of toasted coconut on the nose.  Similar follow-through on the palate—sweeter up front and then becoming dry with firm spice and toasted nuts. Long, resinous, warm spice finish.  I’d like a little less dried spice on the finish—or more sweetness to balance it. Otherwise, a nice bourbon.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
85,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Arran) 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,63,"Distilled in February 2000 and matured in a single refill hogshead, this example of Arran is part of the Provenance range which highlights the season of distillation on the bottle label. Malt, salt, milk chocolate, vanilla, and developing citrus notes on the fragrant nose. Quite full in the mouth, fruity and zesty, with a hint of grist. Long and softly spiced in the finish, with almonds and a final suggestion of aniseed. £40",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Blair Athol) 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 12 year old example of Diageo’s Perthshire single malt has been matured in a sherry butt and features milk chocolate, malt, and digestive biscuits on the nose; becoming fruitier, notably with lemon curd. The palate is rich, sweet, and spicy, with barley, honey, and white grapes. Vanilla and spicy orange marmalade in the medium-length finish. £40",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Glen Scotia 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Lemonade, hints of aniseed, and putty on the nose. Tropical fruits, spice, and milk chocolate on the palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with a hint of licorice. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Glen Scotia 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,67,"Nougat and a suggestion of fresh newsprint on the nose. Quite full-bodied, with a palate of mixed nuts and peaches in brandy. The finish is slightly waxy, with fruit and nut chocolate. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Highland Park) 15 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Unlike ‘house’ bottlings of Highland Park, all of which are aged in sherry casks, this expression in Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series has been matured in former bourbon wood. It was distilled in September 1996. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with nougat and peanut butter, plus a slightly herbal note, and finally discreet, sweet peat smoke. Medium-bodied, citric, and spicy, with a little smoke. Smokiness turns to ash in the finish, with citrus fruit and caramel. £70",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Lagavulin 12 year old 2012 Special Release,,Single Malt Scotch,111,"This is usually a bracing expression of Lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat, ozone freshness, but with greater sweetness than in 2011, though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. The palate is, yes, smoky, but there’s also light cereal, praline, violets, and seashore aromas aplenty. Fills the mouth with intensity. Okay, it’s edgy, but that’s what you expect.",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
85,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Ledaig 1993 St-Joseph Wood Finish,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled in May 1993, this bottling is of the Ledaig heavily-peated variant of Tobermory single malt. Aged for 19 years, it was ‘finished’ for 40 months in wine casks from the St-Joseph AOC in northern Rhône. Pickled beetroot, emerging caramel, and distant log-fire embers on the nose. Voluptuous and fruity, notably spicy—pepper and ginger—plus mulled wine notes. Quite lengthy in the finish, with lingering spice. Peatiness is most evident here. 2,200 bottles.  ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Littlemill 21 year old Burns Malt,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Online retailer TheWhiskyBarrel.com has released 60 bottles of 21 year old single malt from the now-lost Lowland distillery of Littlemill. Maturation has taken place in a sherry hogshead and cask #35 yielded 306 bottles, with the balance being held by whiskybroker.co.uk. The nose is rich and thick, with old sherry, caramel, and cinnamon, while the full palate boasts aniseed, pipe tobacco, and an effervescence that is unusual in a whisky of this age. The finish is lengthy, with drying sherry notes. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,"Wemyss Malts (distilled at Glen Scotia) 'Strawberry Ganache,' 46%",,Single Malt Scotch,,"This single cask variant of Glen Scotia has been matured in a sherry butt for 21 years, and the cask yielded 833 bottles. Fruity on the nose, with sultanas, cherries, marzipan, and milk chocolate. The palate showcases overripe oranges, sherry, and plain chocolate, with a tang of brine. Drying in the finish, with pepper, licorice, and subtle smoke. £110",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Clynelish) “A Day at the Coast” 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of the latest batch of single cask bottlings from Wemyss Malts is a 15 year old Clynelish, named ‘Fresh Fruit Sorbet.’ 331 bottles have been released. Tinned pears, new-mown hay, honey, and lemon sherbet on the nose, with a hint of machine oil. The palate is smooth and fruity, with pears, figs, and a suggestion of black pepper. The dominant fruitiness continues through the sugary finish, with a background prickle of spice. £60",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
85,Kornog Sant Erwan 2012,50.0,French Whisky,110,"Bearing the easiest name of all the Kornogs to pronounce, this is also the least challenging and complex. It is, pretty much, a straightforward peated whisky with more citrus fruits than the others, some apple and pear in the mix, and some chilled spices. The finish is long, smoky, and spicy. Benefits massively from a little water. €86",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
85,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Straight Rye,50.0,Rye Whiskey,70,"Very different than other straight rye whiskeys you might be familiar with: there’s no corn in the recipe, just a large percentage of rye and a small amount of malted barley. It’s youthful, with spice as the defining character (cinnamon, mint, allspice, freshly ground pepper), balanced by blackberry preserve, caramel, butterscotch, and a hint of cotton candy. Lingering dried spice and polished oak on the finish provide balance to the sweeter notes.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
85,Filibuster Dual Cask,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"There’s that 95% rye mashbill that tags this as an LDI-sourced rye…but it’s been finished in French oak white wine barrels. Pepper, warm ripe red plum, sweet vanilla, and a slice of nougat make for a sweet and urgent nose. The rye blows up in the mouth, lots more peppery spice, some flashy mint, and a thin, honeyed sweetness that hints at the nougat. Finish is a bit clingy, but a nice young rye with an interesting difference. (sourced whiskey)",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
85,Still Waters 1-11 Special Blend,40.0,Canadian,,"Still Waters blends sourced whiskey with under 9.09% of their own young spirit as top dressing (hence the name; it’s one part in eleven). Sweet cereal, honey, and flowers on the nose, which become much more authoritative in the mouth. Still sweet, but with a firm thump on the tongue, hot thin honey, crushed flower petals, and a lively, welcome heat for 40%. Clean, cereal-honey finish. Could be a bit more robust, but I like it fine as it is. (Ontario exclusive)C$35",Lew Bryson,Winter 2012
85,Jefferson’s Ocean-Aged,44.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"This Jefferson’s bourbon spent most of its life (almost four years) on a boat in the ocean. All that rocking and environmental conditioning has this whisky tasting four to five times its age. Yes, there’s plenty of resinous oak and leather, but there are also balancing notes of molasses, treacle, toffee, old demerara rum, and roasted nuts. A peppering of cinnamon, mint, tobacco, and maybe…yes, brine add intrigue.",John Hansell,Fall 2012
85,The Dalmore 1980 31 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 1980 expression of The Dalmore Constellation has been solely matured in a Gonzales Byass Apostoles oloroso sherry butt. The resultant whisky is sweet on the nose, with dates, figs, milk chocolate-covered caramel, and finally a suggestion of eucalyptus. Briefly fruity on the palate, becoming bitter, with dark coffee notes. Long and spicy in the finish, with black pepper and licorice. Cask number 2140; 227 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
85,Glen Garioch Vintage 1997,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The first Glen Garioch vintage to be exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and also the only one so far to post-date the closure of  their on-site floor maltings. This leads to a less peaty note in the spirit than in other vintages. Matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. Tinned peaches in syrup and nougat on the nose. Sweet malt, heather honey, vanilla, restrained cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger on the palate. Subtle oak notes in the lengthy finish. £50",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
85,"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1996 (Release 3, Cask #10019)",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Light amber. A very clean, mealy, and creamy nose with real sweetness and a belt of vanilla before things settle into the realm of cooked fruits enlivened by masses of peppermint. The oak shows itself as hot sawdust and a little cedar. In the mouth, that sweetness continues to alternate between a prickly feel and sweet fruit syrups, while Macallan’s oily earthiness anchors it both on the tongue and to the distillery. 285 bottles.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
85,Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Rosebank) 21 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has been responsible for quite a number of releases from the ‘lost’ Lowland distillery of Rosebank, and this one was distilled during January 1990 and bottled in April 2012. The nose is pleasingly floral and fragrant, light and gently honeyed, with a suggestion of barley in the background. The palate features spicy, sweet orange, herbs, and a slightly contrasting note of citrus fruit. Spices persist into the warming, lightly-oaked finish. £135",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
85,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Clynelish) “A Day at the Coast” 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of the latest single cask bottlings (354 bottles) from Wemyss Malts specifically for the U.S., “A Day at the Coast” was sourced from the East Sutherland distillery of Clynelish. Ozone, warm sand, and wild grasses on the nose, plus a hint of honey, grated ginger, and a freshly-opened box of milk chocolates. The viscous palate features rock salt, white pepper, coconut, green apples, and a squeeze of lemon. Medium to long in the finish, softly citric, and salty.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
85,Jailers Premium Tennessee Whiskey,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Sweet corn and dried cherries on the nose; pleasantly, quirkily intense. The palate is clean, sweet with corn and a hint of those cherries, framed by oak, and leads to a finish with no surprises: corn, oak, and a slight clench of heat. It’s almost predictable: there are no real flaws, but there’s no greatness, either. Still, solid delivery is a good thing. (sourced whiskey) —LB",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
85,Auchentoshan Springwood,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"Part of Auchentoshan’s new travel retail line-up, Springwood carries no age statement, contains younger whiskies than Heartwood, and has been matured in 100 percent ex-bourbon wood. Acetone, tinned peaches in vanilla, and whipped cream on the floral nose. The palate is clean and fruity, initially citric, with emerging apricots in honey, and fresh spices. More spice in the finish, with focuses on milk chocolate, cinnamon, and a suggestion of Madeira. €42",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
85,Bladnoch 9 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Following on from the official 8 year old release of Bladnoch, distilled and matured under the current Raymond Armstrong regime, comes a 9 year old variant in the familiar distillery label series. It offers a spring-like nose of cereal, freshly-squeezed lemon juice, meadow flowers, and a hint of milky coffee. Spicy toffee, apples, honey, and ginger on the palate, which finishes with a floral note, lemon, apples, and lively oak. £40",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
85,Clynelish 14 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Ahh, Clynelish. The enigma of the northeast coast. A single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. This is a palate whisky, the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits, notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. It’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging, strangely savory, lightly sweet, juicily fruity. Enigmatic indeed.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
85,Wemyss Malts ‘Rum ‘n’ Raisin’ Single Cask,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Produced at Tullibardine distillery in 1989, this ex-bourbon hogshead has yielded 299 bottles. The expression lives up to its name with rum and raisin ice cream on the nose; floral, with glacé cherries, dried apricots, and pistachio nuts. More nuts and lots of spice on the palate, plus dark chocolate, dates, and prunes. The finish is medium in length, with spicy, benign oak. £85",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
85,Knob Creek Rye,50.0,Rye Whiskey,,"Unlike the Knob Creek bourbons (which are 9 years old), there’s no age statement with this new rye, which tastes relatively younger. It’s bracing, vibrant, and spicy. (The rye contribution is unmistakable.) Cinnamon spice and crisp mint dominate, with charcoal, botanicals, ginger, nutmeg, honeyed fruit, vanilla, and caramel. Warming spice finish. Its dynamic personality should shine in cocktails, but from a sipping, drinking neat perspective, I wish it was a little older like its siblings.",John Hansell,Summer 2012
85,Bakery Hill Classic Single Malt,46.0,Australian Whisky,,"Bakery Hill has been at the forefront of Australian whisky for some years now, but David Baker's struggled to keep making good whisky and simultaneously open export channels for it. That's about to change, and a good thing too, because this is very good indeed — clean, fresh, and malty with plenty of honey and vanilla — smooth, blemish-free, and excellently made , this wouldn't look out of place in Speyside. A$88",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
85,Elijah Craig 20 year old Barrel No. 3742,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"The second 20 year old single barrel release, sold at Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center. (I rated the first one a 96.) Like its predecessor, this one sports a beautiful nose — and beginning of the palate — with toffee, nougat, pecan pie, and coconut truffle. But some fairly aggressive, tactile oak on the finish keeps this whiskey from earning a higher rating.",John Hansell,Summer 2012
85,Henry McKenna 10 year old Barrel No. 693,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Single barrel, and not chill-filtered. Notably spicy (especially cinnamon) and gripping on the palate — the ten years in oak are not lost here. Some botanical notes too, especially toward the finish. Somewhat aggressive, but underlying notes of caramel, candy corn, and ripe tangerine help soften the blow. Despite its slightly imposing personality, it shows character and never steps over the line. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.) ",John Hansell,Summer 2012
85,Corsair Hopmonster,46.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Well-named: hops aroma comes flying right out of the glass — green pine and light peppermint — along with hot, sweet booze, but it’s a very clean scent, not feinty or heavy. The whiskey itself is quite light, not overbearing, and sweet with more pine and mint, along with a very pure malt character and a light touch of oaky vanilla. This is IPA booze, a rain-pure version, and more barrel could ruin it. Great gateway whiskey for a beer geek. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
85,Balcones Brimstone,53.0,Craft Whiskey,74,"Oddly smoky nose that grows on you — this is blue corn smoked with Texas scrub oak — you can smell burnt oak and light wreathings of corn. The first jolt is jalapeño without the heat, followed by a cornbread rush with a very light riff of smoke. The smoke builds to the finish and curls nicely around the corn. A very different whiskey experience; one I could get to like (could I try some with a plate of brisket?). ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
85,Traditional Ben Nevis,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"An attempt to replicate the spirit produced at Ben Nevis in 1882. The malt is peated to around 30 ppm, and a first edition of 700 bottles with no age statement has been released. Initial starch on the nose, then buttery smoked haddock, a hint of chili, sherry, and gentle wood smoke. Full-bodied, spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and peat. Stewed fruit and lingering spicy cigarette ash in the finish. £60",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
85,Lagavulin 12 year old 2011 Special Release,,Single Malt Scotch,103,"Brought back as an annual limited edition to satisfy the cravings of those who like their peat full-on and never understood why Lagavulin moved to 16 years of age, this is the Kildalton coast single malt at its most boisterous. Aromatically, it blazes a seaweed-strewn, zigzag pathway between sea, shore, and land: bog myrtle and samphire, beach bonfire, sea spray, and melon before, with much-needed water, there’s slow-burning Latakia pipe tobacco and Lapsang Souchong tea.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
85,Jura Feith A’ Chaorainn 1976 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,796,"The name of this limited-edition bottling translates as ‘the lands around the rowan,’ and the component whisky has been matured in three, fresh-run American white oak hogsheads. Tinned peaches, a hint of smoke, and developing cream soda on the nose. Soft toffee and ultimately, chimney soot. The palate is full and fruity, with Brazil nuts, drying quite rapidly, with coriander notes. Dark chocolate and licorice characterize the finish. (500 bottles). £500",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
85,Auchentoshan Valinch,,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Auchentoshan Valinch is essentially a cask strength version of the popular Classic expression. It is named after the metal tube used to extract samples of spirit from the cask. A nose of tinned peaches in syrup, Madeira, cinnamon, newly-planed wood, coconut, and vanilla notes. Sweet and spicy on the creamy palate, with vanilla, honey, and praline. Oak and spice in the peach liqueur-like finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
85,Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Imperial) 1997 13 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Pale straw. One of a seemingly never-ending stream of Imperials from Duncan Taylor, all of which show remarkable consistency and are rarely over-wooded, thereby allowing the distillery character to shine. Here are echoes of Loire Sauvignon Blanc — nettles, gooseberry, cut grass, fennel tops, and fresh herbs — with a hint of Imperial’s giveaway American cream soda softness. The palate is as soft as soy milk. Classic Imperial.£38",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
85,Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition carries no age statement, though it contains a blend of whisky more than 15 years old and spirit produced since the distillery reopened in 2003. It has been matured in former bourbon barrels. The nose exhibits barley, citrus fruits, pear drops, crystallized ginger, marzipan, and cocoa. Oily in the mouth and slightly earthy, with brazil nuts and developing vanilla fudge and lemon on the palate. Fruitiness persists through the spicy finish. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
85,Wemyss The Hive 12 year old,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Wemyss has picked up where The Easy Drinking Whisky Company left off a few years back and are selling their mix of malt whiskies under a descriptive flavor name. This is the best the company has done so far. It is a delightfully soft, fruity, and dessert-like whisky with, yes, lashings of honeyed malt to make it a soft, succulent treat of a whisky. Wemyss comes of age.  £36",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
85,Jefferson’s Straight Rye Whiskey 10 year old,47.0,Rye Whiskey,,"A 100&#37; straight rye from Canada. This is curiously similar to (and more affordable than) WhistlePig rye, which is also a 100&#37; rye, 10 year old Canadian whisky, but at a slightly higher 50&#37; ABV. (Neither whiskey identifies its origin.) It oozes spice (mint, cinnamon, hint of nutmeg) balanced by layers of sweetness (honeyed vanilla, caramel), with nutty toffee emerging on the finish.",John Hansell,Fall 2011
85,Jefferson's Very Small Batch Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"The whiskey’s formula has been improved, and now consists of a higher percentage of older whiskies (into the high teens) than the original release (which I rated 81). Nicely balanced, with candied fruit, blackberry jam, soft vanilla, kettle corn, and a kiss of mint. Pleasant, unpretentious, and uncomplicated.",John Hansell,Fall 2011
85,Clynelish Distillers Edition 1992,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 1992 vintage from Clynelish distillery is part of Diageo’s Distillers Edition range of ‘finished’ single malts, and it underwent a secondary period of maturation in oloroso seco casks prior to bottling. Sweet sherry, honey, and oranges on the nose, with a gentle note of rum and cloves. The palate initially offers vibrant sherry, sultana, and hazelnuts, with developing cloves, angelica, and spices. The finish is medium in length, with a mild note of enduring ginger. £45 (Not available in the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
85,Glen Garioch 1994 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The latest release from Glen Garioch is a limited edition 1994 vintage, produced when the distillery still boasted working floor maltings, and is therefore more peaty than spirit subsequently distilled. Pear drops, vanilla, and developing caramel on the nose. Freshly-opened cigarette packets, and, in time, brown paper and vinegar. Quite dry and austere on the palate, with stem ginger and subtle smoke. Persistently spicy in the medium-length finish, with an elusive late flurry of smoky, chocolate caramel. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
85,Glengoyne 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Glengoyne’s entry-level 10 year old is the most readily available of their malts, and is made using entirely unpeated malt. The producers claim this helps to preserve “the essence of its flavor.” Fresh and well-rounded on the nose, with medium sweet aromas suggesting malt, oak, and a hint of sherry. Smooth and delicate on the palate, it is slightly oaky, with a suggestion of cooking apples. The finish is pleasingly long, with buttery, vanilla notes, slowly drying. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
85,Glenturret 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 10 year old expression from the Perthshire distillery of Glenturret has replaced the 12 year old. Glenturret is at the heart of The Famous Grouse blend, and the distillery was re-branded as ‘The Famous Grouse Experience’ in 2002. Nutty and slightly oily on the nose, with barley and citrus fruits. Sweet and honeyed on the full, fruity palate, with a balancing note of oak. Medium length in the sweet finish. £31 (Not available in the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
85,Mackmyra Moments &mdash; Drivved,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"Early bottlings of Mackmyra were a challenge — salty peat, intense woodiness, and unusual juniper-influenced spices made the whisky an acquired taste. Over time though, sweet fruit brought more balance and the whiskies have bloomed. This special bottling — one of four in the Moments series — recalls those roots but delivers a meaty, spicy, and earthy flavor with melt in the mouth syrup. Imagine honey poured on a heavily peppered well-done steak. €141 (Currently not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
85,Kornog Sant Ivy 2011,,French Whisky,105,"This is another young peated whisky, but the earthy and dusty smoke is wrapped around a honeycomb and milk chocolate center. It’s both rugged and comforting, the whisky equivalent of chili chocolate: a bittersweet love affair for those who enjoy the contrary nature of sweet and savory. €77 (Currently not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
85,Speyburn 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Okay, how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? How many have started your whisky life with this and then set it aside? Time to rethink. Speyburn, one of the forgotten distilleries of Rothes, is a charmer. Sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose, the palate shows ginger, cream, and rhubarb. (Value Pick)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
85,Auchentoshan 1998,,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This 1998 vintage triple distilled Lowland Auchentoshan has been matured in fino sherry casks, which are rarely used for Scotch whisky maturation. The nose presents violets in fresh soil, honey, spice, developing citric fruit notes, and almonds. Quite full-bodied, fruity and zesty in the mouth. Lengthy in the finish, with spice, nuts, and oak. Becoming dry and gingery at the last.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
85,Gordon & MacPhail “Private Collection” Port Wood Finish (distilled at Caol Ila),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Sweet, viscous, and weighty; much more so than its sister whisky (reviewed above) that was finished in Madeira casks. But the same Caol Ila DNA is here — tar, olive brine, pepper — along with fleshy red fruit and chocolate. Lingering ripe fruit and tar on the finish. Save this one for after dinner, or with a book at bedtime.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
85,The Dalmore Spey Dram,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,69,"The Spey Dram is made up of 36 percent whisky matured in ex-oloroso casks and 64 percent from American oak. The nose offers fresh oranges, brittle toffee, cream, and ginger. The nutty palate reveals fresh fruits, and is significantly spicier than the other Rivers expressions, with ginger and even chili notes. The finish is long and notably spicy, with less chocolate than in the three other Rivers variants, ending with a touch of treacle. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
85,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1980,,Single Malt Scotch,410,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. This is from a first fill American oak hoggie, and the extra time in cask has given it a classic mature Glenlivet character: a rich, complex mix of cooked apple, pine, and citrus, cut with rose petal. The fruitiness has moved from pear into baked apricot. Water adds an almond note. The scented notes have been retained (especially on the finish), but have deepened into sweet spice. The oak gives light grip. Have with chilled water on the side. £250",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
85,Canadian Club Classic 12,40.0,Canadian,,"Nose is much more integrated than the others; caramel and light honey tones with an oaky vein. After four CCs that were sequentially innocent, clumsy, eager, and balanced, this one is confident: well-rounded, sweet but not goopy, oaked but not prickly. Well-named: this is a classic Canadian.  ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2011
85,Bulleit Rye Whiskey,45.0,Rye Whiskey,,"No age statement, but it includes 4 to 7 year old whiskeys. The mashbill is 95% rye — much higher than most standard rye whiskeys out there. It’s brisk, vibrant, and loaded with spice (crisp mint, warming cinnamon, cocoa, hint of anise). Fruit — ripe nectarine, apricot, golden raisin — drizzled with maple syrup. Dry oak rounds out the finish. Bold enough for cocktails. Mature enough to drink neat (or on the rocks). ",John Hansell,Summer 2011
85,"Inverleven, Chivas Brothers, Deoch an Doras bottling",,Single Malt Scotch,,"This veteran Lowland Inverleven — distilled within the now decommissioned Dumbarton grain distillery complex — is a recent addition to Chivas Brothers’ Cask Strength Edition series, and is exclusively available at distillery visitor centers and from www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com. The nose is creamy, gentle, and sweet, with vanilla, rum raisin ice cream, and a subtle, contrasting peppery note. Mouth-coating, with citrus fruits and slowly developing dark chocolate, which lingers through the long and gingery finish. (500 bottles). Currently not available in the U.S. £275 ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
85,Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Mortlach),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Certainly not the best Mortlach I’ve tasted, but it’s a solid effort and at a good price for a 21 year old. Nicely balanced — Lorne Mackillop’s hallmark — and somewhat reserved, too (for a Mortlach), with intriguing lime, kiwi, caramel, floral notes (on the nose), nutty toffee (especially on the palate), soaked barley, and charcoal, with a rather syrupy, mouth-clinging texture toward the finish. Worth a look.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
85,Kilchoman (Summer 2010 Release),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This young distillery’s fourth release, aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (This is the first one available in the U.S.) The two previous releases that I tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the Autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. I miss the sherry, to be honest. I think it softened the whisky, added a new dimension, and perhaps even masked some of the youth. Still, this is a very nice effort: brisk, vibrant, and bracing, with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar, along with pear, citrus, vanilla, licorice root, bourbon barrel char, clove, bitter chocolate, and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
86,Compass Box The Circle (2019 Release),46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"Rosey Mitchell, of Three Sheets cocktail bar in London and winner of the Compass Box bartender competition, collaborated on this whisky with Compass Box whisky maker Jill Boyd. Apple strudel, well-toasted malted bread, red apple, and hints of peat smoke: this pushes in lots of different directions. Light fudge, a well of active spices, orange, and peppercorn with smoked citrus peel on the dry finish. Convoluted and discombobulating. (6,151 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Leopold Bros. Small Batch American Whiskey (Barrel No. 1206),43.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),33,"The nose is plucky and herbaceous, with tarragon, dill, licorice, and heaps of chili powder and cornmeal—a bit like elote from a street vendor. Savory flavors dominate the palate, which is dry and nutty; water brings out meaty chili, unsweetened chocolate, and coffee bean. The finish has grilled corn, more chili spices, and roasted pecans. Water softens the edges, but use a light touch so as not to over dilute.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
86,Chicken Cock Beer Barrel Select,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Dried orange and apricot, cherry hard candy, and vanilla frosting on the nose, along with cantaloupe, peanut butter, and grainy notes of seed corn. The palate is light, spiced, and oak-driven, with more corn, peanuts, chocolate sauce, and orange oil, plus vanilla, iced tea, citrus oil, lemon, spice, and chili pepper. The finish offers more heft, but is light, though with some interesting elements on offer.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Westland Black Raven Brewing Co. American Single Malt,50.0,Single Malt American Whiskey,100,"Herbal and peppery on the nose, offering dill, licorice, guava, and green banana, as well as a hint of mint and black cherry cough medicine. The mouthfeel is somewhat tart, with burnt espresso beans, bitter chocolate, and a note of toasted almond. A long finish of caramel and bitter chocolate, as well as charred, bitter hoppy notes melds with a sweet, honeyed and syrupy taste and texture. A fascinating flavor progression.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Barr An Uisce Wicklow Hills,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,35,"Lemon drizzle cake and finely shredded orange peel on this Barr An Uisce first-fill bourbon cask-matured blend of 21% malt whiskey and 79% grain that has enjoyed a 3-month oloroso sherry finish. With light lemon, green melon, and flashes of citrus, it revs up the toffee and marzipan notes, ending with a pleasing, sweet swan song of caramel and white chocolate. A gentle dram for quiet times.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Davidson Reserve Small Batch Tennessee Straight Sour Mash,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"A pleasant nose of spicy, perfumed oak that’s also lightly floral and melds well with notes of coriander and dill, pistachio pudding, and hints of earthiness and minerality. The palate has plenty of spice and heat, with youthful notes of papaya, cinnamon, salt water taffy, bitter chocolate, and young oak. Water unlocks more pronounced cinnamon and a light nuttiness, improving upon a somewhat youthful finish.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Omar Bourbon Cask Single Malt,46.0,Taiwanese Whisky,80,"Dried banana, curry powder, chopped cilantro, and creamed coconut on the nose, but there’s a note of oak astringency and a scent of menthol toothpaste as well. With crème caramel, banana, dried apricot, and candy sweetness, the whisky has a good weight in the mouth, and builds to flavors of tangerine, with perky peppery spices under the tongue. Lengthy finish of banana taffy and a shower of spice.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Strathcolm The Extra Special,40.0,Single Grain Scotch,30,"This opens promisingly with creamy, buttery aromas of vanilla frosting, toasted crumpets, and dry spices, and delivers on that promise in flavor. A charming silky texture with vanilla sweetness, hints of lemon, spice, and flavors of baked goods arriving in time for the finish of toasted spice. One to splash over ice and sip in the great outdoors. (6,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Broken Top Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Made at Oregon’s Cascade Street Distillery and purporting to be “mountain-style” bourbon, this whiskey presents a mix of herbal and fruity aromas to start, along with baking spice, brown sugar, and vanilla frosting. The palate is light-bodied but rich in oak, roasted nut, dried chili, cocoa powder, and cigar, with dried flower notes when water is added; plenty of oak and dark chocolate on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
86,Jeptha Creed Four Grain Straight Bourbon,49.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The nose is dry and chalky, with notes of dried leaves, dried cherries, and raspberries. The palate is also dry, with some peppery spice. Water unlocks chocolate, and the dryness recedes a bit. The finish is the best part, offering orange Creamsicle and vanilla notes, though still dry. Water brings out light tobacco leaf. Unusually dry and somewhat ashy, with some appealing notes that never quite emerge.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Founding Farmers Rye (Batch 14),50.0,Rye Whiskey,45,"This rye was divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasting panel due to its unusual smokiness, the result of using smoked barley in the mash. On the nose, it presents as mesquite, cooked sausage, tilled earth, Lapsang Souchong, and dry leaves, along with saline and nuts. The palate is full, dry, and savory, with peppered smoked meat, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and big oak flavor. A short dry finish, with cigar notes, but little ash. Distilled at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits Distillery.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
86,Last Straw Straight Ontario Rye,43.0,Canadian,57,"Last Straw’s inaugural whisky is a humdinger of a 100% rye, with oodles of oomph and a pleasing balance of grain and barrel notes. Youthfully malty, it shows rye spices, dry hay, barrel tones, hot black licorice, some citrus notes, and candied fruit. Hints of butterscotch and vanilla temper black pepper and sweet pine pitch. Lots of nuances for a 3 year old. The flavor sings at bottle strength. $75 CAD ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
86,Old Potrero Single Malt Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,70,"Made with 100% malted rye. A nose of candied orange, cherry, green banana, and melon, along with sultanas, prunes, berries, and nuts. The palate starts orangey and sweet, followed by licorice, espresso, bitter chocolate, cashew, molasses, burnt sugar, and spice. Water unveils roasted peanuts, marshmallow char, more chocolate, and coffee beans. The finish is balanced oak, charred almonds, more coffee beans, tropical melon, and orange. Pleasurably crunchy, with intriguing overlays of bitter chocolate, espresso, and nuttiness.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
86,Clan Denny 2008 10 year old (distilled at Craigellachie),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,59,"This bottling from Douglas Laing was distilled in January 2008, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in October 2018. Floral notes on the nose, with barley, vanilla, soft spice, and baked apple. Full-on orchard fruits and more barley on the palate. Soft and sweet. The finish dries, becoming slightly earthy and tannic, with black pepper. (371 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
86,Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Fettercairn),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,59,"Earthy on the early nose, with a brief whiff of boiled cabbage and contrasting hints of violet. Ripe apples and pears on the relatively full palate, with toffee, honey, and a background earthiness. The finish is medium in length, herbal, with ginger and bog oak. (308 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
86,Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Bunnahabhain),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,59,"The nose gives off gentle sea breezes, earthy and nutty aromas, then cocoa powder. Pineapple, toffee, and milk chocolate on the palate, with a suggestion of brine. Nutty in the finish, with white pepper and lingering lemon. (367 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
86,St. George Single Malt (Lot 18),43.0,Single Malt American Whiskey,100,"Plummy, earthy, and zingy with grapefruit and pine aromas, along with orange marmalade, raspberry, and hazelnut. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth, it has flavors of lemon cake, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and intense floral and fruity hops, as well as sweet plum and mocha notes. This whiskey’s beauty is in its delicate balance, although it may veer too far out of the middle lane for conventional palates.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Belle Meade 9 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask Finished,,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Buttery, nutty, and richly spiced, this has all the hallmarks of a sherry-finished whiskey—dried fruit, hazelnuts, chocolate—but retains its bourbon core with strong peanut, concord grape jelly, and roasted corn aromas. On the palate, it’s bourbon first: peanuts, cooked cherries, and plenty of oak. But the sherry softens and rounds out the mouthfeel, adding gentle spice, dried fruit, and silkiness.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,A.D. Laws Four Grain Ruby Porto Cask-Finished,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Aromas of orange, roasted pineapple, lime, pine nuts, cinnamon, and leather on the nose, with a cherry-strawberry note. Light, refined cherry on the palate, with roasted walnuts, dark chocolate, and light char. Water unlocks bright cherry and chocolate fudge, with notes of char and roasted coffee beans. A nutty, fruity finish carries on the red berry note, along with a swirl of vanilla and chocolate. A deft balance of fruit, sweetness, and spice.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
86, Deadwood Rye,,Rye Whiskey,25,"Named for the town of Deadwood, S.D., where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876. A blend of two rye mashbills, 95% rye and 70% rye, aged at least 2 years in American oak. Orange blossom on the nose, herbal notes, pine nuts, anise, and fragrant oak. A honeyed palate offers kiwi, tangerine, and orange, balanced against bitter chocolate and espresso. The finish is sweet, with floral orange notes and chocolate syrup.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
86,Deadwood Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Vivacious and fresh aromas of raspberry, licorice cookies, brown sugar, herbal tea, and toasted oak. The palate falls a little short of the setup, with a light body and some youthful heat driven by oak. Nevertheless, orange and lemon peels, roasted pecans, caramel, blackberry, nutmeg, and black pepper punch through the wood, demonstrating a well-executed, if simple, bourbon.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Infuse Spirits Broken Barrel (Batch 03),,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The nose is sweet and wood-driven, with butterscotch, molasses cookies, toasted pecans, and a faint floral note. Cinnamon, chili pepper, almonds, orange, and candied violets buoy a somewhat thin mouthfeel, all rounded off with sweet floral flavors and subtle oak. Six month old Kentucky bourbon that has been “finished” in stainless steel tanks with French and American oak and oloroso  sherry staves.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Red Saw Straight Bourbon,48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,39,"Grain-forward on the nose, with raw peanuts, milk chocolate, orange pekoe tea, grape Pixy Stix, and cinnamon Teddy Grahams. Without water, the palate is chewy, oaky, and grain-heavy; with water, there’s a delicious Cocoa Krispies flavor, as well as walnuts and cinnamon oatmeal. Nutty chocolate and oak on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Niagara Falls Rye,40.0,Canadian,23,"A straightforward 4 year old Canadian blend, great for mixing, but good for sipping too. It presents flavors of toffee, brisk spices, kiwi fruit, charred wood, and sweet barley sugars. A creamy body with pleasingly penetrating pepper that feels minty-warm, like menthol. Not overly complex, but getting there. More pepper and a refreshing, slightly bitter pithiness on a medium finish. A creamy palate soothes the energetic attack of the spices.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2019
86,Cardhu Gold Reserve,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Representing House Targaryen, this features its three-headed dragon on the label. Malt and honey on the subtle nose, with a hint of cinnamon. Medium-bodied, with milk chocolate, caramel, and youthful oak. Jaffa orange and gentle spice in the relatively short, spiky finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
86,Woodford Reserve Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Fairly light in flavor, with warm cereal and honey notes laced with aromas of green herbs, chamomile, and spearmint. Seems well-crafted, but the flavors are generally understated, offering gentle sweetness and fleeting glimmers of baking spice. Modest body and a touch hot on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
86,McKenzie Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,43,"Vibrantly fruity with strawberry and orange Creamsicle on the nose, along with clean hay, toasted oak, cinnamon, caramel, and bay leaf. Wood spices on the front palate give way to orange custard, pomegranate, caramel, and cinnamon bread notes, with a pop of chili-dusted roasted corn lashed with bitter oak on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
86,Clan Denny (distilled at Port Dundas) 14 year old,46.0,Single Grain Scotch,55,"Red apple skin, sharp citrus zest, peach stone, and shortcake biscuit greet the nose, though there is abundant grain character, with lemongrass and coriander seeds too. A muscular dram from a closed distillery, this reveals sweet cereals, honey, a spectrum of citrus notes, sherbet sweetness, pepper, clove, and herbal notes. Sweetness remains with the pepper in the finish, though clove reigns supreme when water is added.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Clyde May’s Straight Rye,47.0,Rye Whiskey,45,"Generous proof and just 3 years of age mean this is no wallflower whiskey. Peppermint, white flowers, leather, and Pine-Sol aromas turn gingery on the palate, revealing bold rye spice, root beer, licorice, cinnamon sticks, and pine boughs. Good intensity, if a touch brash.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
86,Coppersea Bottled in Bond Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye,50.0,Rye Whiskey,125,"A bottled in bond sequel to the 48% ABV Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye whiskey, this second Empire rye from Coppersea Distilling is made from 100% Hudson Valley rye. A whiff of new wood yields to complex notes of blood orange, iced tea, cinnamon, cloves, and red candy. A palate of allspice, mint, white pepper, and orange peel is followed by a spicy, herbaceous finish that also offers citrus, chocolate, and a hint of tobacco.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
86,Duncan Taylor Dimensions (distilled at Caledonian) 1987 31 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,300,"Produced the year before the distillery closed, this has lemon butter, popcorn, bouquet garni, garlic shoots, and chopped cilantro ensuring the imbiber knows this is grain, not one masquerading as a single malt. Light green fruits reminiscent of melon, apple, and nectarine on the palate, with caramel, vanilla, a little oak, and a ripple of spice, notably coriander seed and pepper, before a finish of pears in golden syrup.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Calumet Farm Single Rack Black 12 year old,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Grainy and floral on the nose, with aromas of bananas Foster, pine resin, cardamom, lemon, iced tea, tart blackberries, and nougat. Kicky black pepper and cinnamon smooth out with a touch of water, yielding banana Popsicle, lemon bars, roasted pistachios, and cigar wrapper. A short finish with toasted oak, pecans, and nougat.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
86,Old Overholt Straight Rye,40.0,Rye Whiskey,17,"A veteran rye whiskey brand that flaunts the floral quality of younger ryes with its summer flowers, bright citrus, and lemon oil notes. A well-polished palate, with warm porridge, and grain notes that smack of peanut butter on warm toast. Nice character and balance, if a touch anemic at this proof.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
86,Sons of Erin,46.0,Irish Single Malt,40,"Zested lemon, pine-scented floor cleaner, and quite a grassy proposition with white peach, dried flowers, perfumed soaps, and orange pith. It has a slightly soapy mouthfeel with lavender, lemon curd, vanilla, and clove and pepper, the spices ramping up the intensity the longer it’s held in the mouth. Clove and bitter lemon on the finish: takes you from whimsy to wildness in seconds.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Hellyers Road Original,40.0,Australian Whisky,70,"Creamy lemon truffles, cereal notes, vanilla sponge, dry oak, with peppered steak seasoning. Creamy, sweet, buttery, soft honeydew melon, peach notes, and orange zest, with a soft late spiciness, though the impression is much more tame than the nose suggests. Buttery, mouth-coating finish with gentle spices on the core whisky from this Tasmanian distillery.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Madoc Single Malt,,World Whisky,63,"Grain takes center stage, showing itself in a restrained, sweet manner: aromas of marzipan, oatmeal cookies, Jordan almonds, crushed peanuts on an ice cream sundae, and caramel. The palate is consistent, offering almond croissant, sugar cookie, vanilla pudding, light caramel, and a creamy mouthfeel, finished off with supple oak, caramel, and almonds. Made in Patagonia, Argentina. <em>2,500 Argentine pesos; Argentina only</em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
86,Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon (2018 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"The nose on this is lovely and seductive, with a gingerbread cookie quality coupled with leather and baking spices. The palate is lively and warming with root beer spices, but its character is overshadowed by the intensity of the toasted barrel, and feels just a bit hollow beneath all that lavish oak.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
86,Aberlour Casg Annamh (Batch 1),48.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"A new small-batch addition to the Aberlour line-up, Casg Annamh (Gaelic for ‘rare cask’) has been matured in European and American oak oloroso sherry casks. Rich, buttery caramel aromas, grilled pineapple, and ginger. The palate is smooth, and yields spicy vanilla, tangerines, and cloves. Lots of black pepper and licorice in the relatively long finish. Less complex than the distillery’s A’bunadh.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
86,Kavalan Distillery Select,43.0,Taiwanese Whisky,60,"With two distilleries now on-site, the new Kavalan has a nose of apple and cinnamon pie, loaves of bread, new hardback books, flashes of lemon peel, and mild spices that flatter the baked fruits. A lighter structure, with pleasant green apple and pear notes, a tingle of pepper and allspice, becoming creamier with the flavor of sherbet flying-saucer candy. More active spices on the finish amid fading fruits.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
86,Kirkland 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Floral and creamy on the nose, like meringue perfumed with orange-blossom water. The palate is straightforward: vanilla, bubble gum, rose petal, orange blossom, and crème brûlée, with a short, light finish of toasted almonds and chalky vanilla fudge. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Kirkland 4 year old,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,,"The first whiff is that of a garden tea party: geraniums, potting soil, and floral and grassy aromas mingle with apple peels, toasted coconut, and vanilla. In the mouth, it’s very light, although the flavors that are present are enjoyable: vanilla cupcake, lemon muffin, toasted almonds, and a hint of coconut. Simplicity that lends itself to easy drinking. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Heaven’s Door Straight Rye,46.0,Rye Whiskey,80,"Violet candies, rose petal, and lots of fresh grainy aromas meet hints of candle wax on the nose. The palate is quite pretty and pure, and delivers good intensity of white pepper spice, citrus, and vanilla cream before a fairly short finish. Does not hold up to water, but there are some nice flavors here.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
86,Driftless Glen Single Barrel Straight Bourbon,48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Oak-forward from start to finish, with aromas of new wood, fresh and dried flowers, oranges, candy apple, cherry soda, and iced tea. Wood, fresh apple, semi-dark chocolate, orange, iced tea, chamomile, and a sweep of spices roll into a cinnamon, clove, and chocolate finish that remains oak-dominated.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Bellevoye Black,43.0,French Whisky,55,"A good hit of woodsmoke, some coastal character, black cherry, and ground black pepper, but there is a sulfurous note with a hint of rubber gloves. The perfectly placid palate of citrus and caramel is disrupted by an angry swarm of pepper, which eventually dies away, leaving behind more smoke and hints of hazelnut. A mouth-watering finish of orange candy and pepper.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
86,Glen Fohdry Dublaich Speyside,,Single Malt Scotch,28,"Earthy and a bit saline on the nose, like a pine forest in spitting distance of the sea. The palate shows a bit of youthful heat, as well as grilled fruit, polished oak, walnuts, and a somewhat soapy character. The finish is nutty and chocolaty, with structured oak. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Ainsley Brae Sauternes Cask Finished Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,30,"A sweet and clean nose, with aromas of confectioners’ sugar, meringue, vanilla, and almond flour. The balanced palate has richer layers of oak, blueberry jam, red berries, candied ginger, and chocolate, leading into a quick but pleasant finish with a hint of spice.

86,Granndach 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,24,"Sherry cask influence makes itself known through cooked plums, chocolate, dried figs, raisins, hazelnuts, and sugared almonds on the nose. The palate is also sherry-forward and sweet, featuring dried and stewed fruit, hazelnut, almond, dark chocolate, and light gingerbread flavors. There’s a youthful heat, and the finish wraps up with bitter oak and a wisp of chocolate-covered raisin. Despite the low proof, a few drops of water help this hang together more evenly. (<em>Walmart</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Woodford Reserve Straight Malt,,Straight Malt,35,"This malt whiskey shows some maple syrup and honey sweetness, but its character comes from savory notes of earthiness and wet leaves. The easygoing palate offers some stone fruit and sweet overripe banana, like a banana cream pie with graham cracker crust. But the finish circles back to savory and herbal, suggesting youth. A creative, if peculiar choice for Woodford, crafted from 51% malted barley.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
86,The Tyrconnell 10 year old Port Cask Finish,46.0,Irish Single Malt,75,"Comparatively speaking, the aromas of red apple, peppercorn, baked ham, and rowanberry make it the least enticing nose in the Tyrconnell range, although the port cask endows a beautiful delicate blush to the whiskey’s color. The mouthfeel is thinner too, with red apple, watermelon, mouth-drawing oak, fruit chews, and burnt spices in the end. A redeeming finish, however, the gums tingling delightfully with fruit and spice.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
86,Smooth Ambler Contradiction Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Oak-driven and tightly wound, with herbal licorice, beeswax, and dried peaches. There is a real outdoorsy quality here of forest floor, autumn leaves, and cut grass. But it feels somewhat tired and weary on the palate, then falls apart with the addition of water. Grab the older bottling (50% ABV). This release has dropped in both proof and quality.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
86,Wilderness Trail Single Barrel Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel 14D07),50.0,Craft Whiskey,52,"It’s all about the grain on the nose: corncob, cooked mash, along with hay and grass, brown sugar, and earthy dried herbs. Chewy tannins overtake more subtle fruit and spice notes in the mouth; add a little water to reveal grape jelly, milk chocolate, and cinnamon candy. An impressive start from this young Kentucky distillery, though the short finish shows it has some developing yet to do. (236 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
86,J. Riddle Peated Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,45,"There’s no missing the peat here; the nose is rife with ash, rubber tires, wood-burning fireplace, and cedar bark. But it also reveals lovely aromas of roasted apples, charred corn, black pepper, and roasted walnuts. Sweet corn, apples, honey, and nuts step forward on the palate, which is a bit hot, along with black pepper, cinnamon, dark chocolate, and oak. The finish is enjoyable ashiness—the end of a cigar.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
86,G. Rozelieures Smoky Collection,46.0,French Whisky,65,"A much darker dram, with smoke from log fires, chocolate, toasted oak, crispy bacon, and dark toffee, but this really drills home the smoke, which dominates over the other characteristics. Toffee, malt, dark cherry, smoking oak, cinnamon, and pepper, but tasting is a rather linear experience. Some redeeming qualities, but it lacks the focus of the rest of the range. Finish of banana loaf and singed fruitcake.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
86,2Bar Straight Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,48,"Seattle bourbon made using Northwest grains. Aromas of goldenrod, golden raisins, and spicy stewed prunes; a panoply of alluring spices, chocolate, and oak. The palate carries through with similar notes, along with apricot and dark red fruits, but a dusty edge and an excess of tight, tannic green oak hold it back. Chili-chocolate spice, minerality, and lingering fruit on the finish. Impressive complexity, but somewhat woody and off-balance.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
86,Evan Williams 1783,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"It begins with notes of brown sugar, Nutter Butter, hazelnut, nutmeg, and vanilla, with hints of roasted nuts. They’re pronounced and rounded, with secondary and tertiary notes introducing malt, cornbread, and salt water taffy. The medium finish offers a hint of bacon bits.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
86,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Chardonnay Cask Finish,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,30,"After 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks, this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks. The nose offers resinous wine notes, melon, grapefruit, and a hint of vanilla. Nutty on the palate, with orchard fruits, more vanilla, and milk chocolate. Peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish, with apples, nutmeg, and a sprinkling of black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Peated,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,30,"Highly approachable, with soft, earthy peat on the nose, plus pineapple, honey, and vanilla. Warm leather, ashy peat, ripe pears, and discreet vanilla notes on the palate. Slightly thinner than the unpeated Classic. Relatively long in the finish, with peppery peat and ultimately, aniseed.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Sherry Cask Finish,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,30,"After 6 to 7 years in a bourbon cask, this is finished for 9 to 12 months in oloroso casks. Sweet sherry, glacé cherries, butterscotch, and roses on the nose. Medium-bodied, with caramel, dark chocolate-cherry liqueur, and warming spices. The finish yields black currant, cough medicine, then allspice, and slowly drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Pearse The Original,42.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,40,"Ripe yellow fruits, summer florals, satsuma peel, anise candy, and, unexpectedly, a catch of smoke at the back of the throat. Interestingly, the malt in this blend was made elsewhere, on the stills now installed at the Pearse Lyons Distillery in Dublin. Mellow, with tropical fruits, melon, and citrus. It becomes quite tangy, with a growing dominance of spices, ginger, and pepper. Shades of sourness creep in, heralding a light, spicy finish. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,Bushmills Original,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,23,"Who wouldn’t love this? Aromas of vanilla, malt, cream, cake batter, mashed banana, and heady florals, with a hint of dark fruit and dry spice. There is concordance between the nose and palate; the taste is sweet and honeyed, with orange, lemon and lime zest, and well-integrated spices, then becomes creamier, with custard, banana loaf, a little dark peel, and marmalade. Honey and citrus round things off nicely.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchroisk) 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Lemon meringue pie, flaked almonds, cereal bars, almost porridge-like, enlivened by the tiniest pinch of allspice. A ferocious peppery intensity saves itself for the palate, where it tramples all over the lemon zest and apple flavors without mercy. Once the conquering spices call it a day, this is a sweeter concoction, with soft fudge, brown sugar, and blueberry muffin. In the finish, the allspice has the final word. (Batch 3; 162 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dailuaine) 2007 10 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This single cask, cask-strength bottling was matured in a port hogshead. Slightly sharp on the initial nose, savory, and a touch vegetal. The palate is full and malty, offering creamy toffee, hazelnuts, ripe peaches, and ginger. Creaminess lasts through the cinnamon-spiced medium-length finish. (290 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Timorous Beastie 10 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,47,"Soft and floral with perfumed lavender soap, peach, green apple, and parma violets. It floats in the mouth, dispensing flavors of sweet apple, custard, tangy tangerine, hard candies, green plum, marshmallow, and white pepper. Delicious and accomplished, but there’s an overlap here: it feels like the NAS version had a birthday, rather than the arrival of a new member of the family. £35",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,Glynnevan Cabot Triple Barrelled Canadian Rye,45.0,Canadian,43,"By finishing this blend of two sourced whiskies in its own maritime rum barrels, Authentic Seacoast Distillery gives this classic Canadian whisky a somehow tropical twist. Oily molasses undertones on the nose continue onto a spicy palate, which is syrupy but not slippery, with hints of wet slate, bananas, and heavy fruit. Barrel notes and suggestions of dry oak restrain an initially lush mouthfeel. (Nova Scotia only) $55 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
86,Union Horse Rolling Standard Midwestern Four Grain,46.0,Craft Whiskey,35,"This amber-hued whiskey seems part bourbon, part single malt, offering a nose of sweet dried fruits —raisin and apples—heaped with earthy, leathery oak. The palate is enjoyable for its crème caramel sweetness and drinkability, but the drying oak is a bit heavy-handed, overwhelming the medium body. A serviceable and versatile whiskey for the price. Corn, malted barley, wheat, and rye.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
86,Old Elk Blended Straight Bourbon,44.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Initially restrained; as the nose opens up it reveals plum, red berry fruit, pine resin, and root-beer spices. The palate picks up a bit, slightly vinous in its red-fruit drive, herbal-cherry cough drop, and sweet vanilla, leading to a modest finish laced with licorice, cinnamon, and pine forest.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
86,Bird Dog Kentucky Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Quite an unusual start: melted butter poured over brown rice followed by caramel, vanilla, and fried sweet potatoes. Although the ABV suggests it’s light, the body actually holds up quite well with notes of banana, quince, marzipan, bread pudding, and vanilla. Alas, the short finish doesn’t follow suit, only offering a hint of caramel.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
86,The Balvenie 2004 13 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This expression was aged in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. A savory opening to the nose, followed by figs dipped in lemon juice. Sweet, spicy cream sherry on the palate, Christmas cake flavors, then black pepper and tannins develop. The finish is medium to long, with honey and malt. Accomplished, but expensive for its age.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
86,Jim Beam Distiller’s Cut,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,23,"Cornbread and toffee start this alluring whiskey, followed by hints of paprika, fruits, flowers, and caramel. Afterward, it opens up into a bakery with cinnamon rolls, caramel chews, vanilla cupcakes, and ginger. Baking spices and earth appear over a medium finish that offers black licorice. It’s well-suited for mixing.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
86,Balcones True Blue Cask Strength Corn (Batch TB17-1),,Craft Whiskey,80,"Baking spices, pipe tobacco, vanilla, citrus peel, cardamom, dried apricots, and dates unwind on the nose, carried by plenty of fresh oak. The potent palate explodes with up-front sweetness, laced with cocoa and maduro tobacco notes, but the chest-thumping herbal oak brings it to a quick and slightly bitter finish. A splash of water brings the elements into better balance as peach syrup sweetness starts to shine.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
86,FEW Copper & Kings Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,50,"This is a bold style of bourbon, finished in American brandy barrels and brandishing fiery spirit and sweet corn. Yet the beautiful sweetness, layered with butter and spearmint underscored by cedary oak, offers a lot to like, especially on the nutty-sweet finish, with its peanut and charred wood flavors.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
86,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 1993 24 year old,,Single Grain Scotch,140,"The nose evokes aromas of school textbook spines, freshly planed oak, vanilla, and dry-roasted fennel and coriander seeds. A mouth-puckering sip begins innocently enough with golden caramels and toffee, before a double whammy of spice and alcohol give it quite a kick. The sweetness concentrates deliciously, becomes tangy, before sliding into a finish of long-lingering spices and residual oaky sweetness. (Cask no. 901820; 168 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
86,George Remus Straight Bourbon,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Cotton candy, caramel, baked apples, roasted pecans, freshly baked rye rolls, and herbs start a truly approachable pour. Its story opens in a spice race: cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and smoked paprika and a slight hint of coffee. A burst of dill hits, just before vanilla walks it home to a lovely, medium finish. An interesting sipper, but remarkable in cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
86,Sierra Norte Single Barrel White,45.0,World Whisky,50,"White has the most familiar corn whiskey character of this Mexican trio. Sweet buttered cobs of corn, faint toasted spices, green corn husks, and peanuts on the nose. The palate is sweet, gentle, and refreshing, bathed in honey, with dried peel, sweet corn, toasted oak spices, and a late sensation of charred oak, burnt toast, and peppercorn. That slight burnt note just creeps into the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
86,Shieldaig 14 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Bottled by Ian Macleod Distillers from an undisclosed producer, this Islay single malt may well emanate from Ardbeg. The nose offers lemon, rock pools, peat ash, and smoky malt, with a sweet, honeyed floral note at its heart. Medium-bodied, with big citrus flavors, tingling spices, brine, ashy peat, and aniseed. Aniseed lingers in the finish, with diminishing spiciness.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
86,"Booker’s 2017-02 “Blue Knights Batch,” 63.7%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Think corn: roasted, canned, creamed, mashed, pan-fried, in salsa, and in bread. The corn pops early and often. This complements hazelnut, caramel pudding, and baking spices. A drop of water really opens this up, softening the corn-heavy notes and bringing forth fruits and spices. Even the finish is better with water. Perhaps this whiskey was meant to have a lower proof.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
86,Ohishi Brandy Cask,,Japanese,75,"Lemon, lime, ripening apple, spring florals, clementine, and pear, among lilting sweet brandy notes. Calming, contemplative, and restful aromas. The mouthfeel is slightly musty, almost granular, with creamy light vanilla and juicy lemon and lime. The tip of the tongue burns brightly with warm spices. It grows heavier, the tastes shifting to lemon bonbons as the spice is annulled. A dying gasp of lemon peel, candy sweetness, and aromatic spices.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
86,Grangestone Sherry Finish,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,29,"Matured for 6 to 8 years in bourbon casks before finishing in sherry casks. The early nose is earthy, with dough balls, then sweeter sherry notes emerge, with ripe tangerines and honey. Sweet sherry fills the full palate with black pepper and developing raisins. Plain chocolate, black pepper, and aniseed in the relatively long finish. Distillery not disclosed.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
86, J. Mossman Platinum Crown 15 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,54,"Nutty nose, with toasted oak, savory peppered meats, and traces of wood smoke. It starts off deceptively lightweight, with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. Honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by, chased by a gentle swish of spice. Light pepperiness with chocolate notes ushers in an aromatic finish. A tasty blend, but the nose will not be everyone’s choice.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
86,Egan’s Vintage Grain,46.0,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,45,"From vintage 2009, this bourbon cask matured whiskey is around the 8 year mark. Vanilla custard tarts, digestive biscuits, green vegetal notes, and scents of a bakery counter pull you in. Caramel, active spices, soft fruits, peach, apple, pear, pepper, and golden sultana flavors, but as the caramels slide into toffee the grain character becomes more evident into the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
86,Wild Turkey 101,,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Cotton candy, campfire smoke, cinnamon, pilsner beer, butterscotch, and vanilla start a whiskey conversation that’s about balance, easy sipping, and the pursuit of spice. Around mid-palate, a plethora of baking spices—clove, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, and allspice—charms the senses. It’s set up to be a great run, but the approach softens toward the finish with muted brown sugar appearing. Still, the flavor and balance make for a fun sipper and great cocktail mixer.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
86,Evan Williams Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"Some bourbons are balanced or complex; this is an all-around versatile pour with initial notes of lightly toasted oak, brown sugar, and butterscotch. A fun maltiness, concentrated caramel, and slight hints of cinnamon and watermelon Juicy Fruit hammer home its sipping potential, but its short to medium finish suggests that it’s more suited for cocktails. But hey, why not both?",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
86,Writers Tears Copper Pot,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"Blends of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskey without grain deserve their own category, but there’s no use crying about it. Roasted spices, Quaker Oats, light honey, and fresh apricot; a little reserved and demure. Golden honey sweetness, light citrus, green apple, peach pit, dried apricot, cereal notes, creamy vanilla, and a firm strand of pot still spiciness. Dry spice heat, citrus peel, and a dark vanilla aftertaste.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
86,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Speyside) 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,52,"Few single malt whiskies from the Speyside Distillery make it to the U.S. This noses like a gammon joint glazed with sliced orange and a side order of sugar mice. Hesitantly, a sip brings relief with dark chocolate, stewed rhubarb, strained raspberry juices, walnut, and burnt bakery goods. Dry finish with remnants of cocoa. Worth experimenting with water, as lovely candied peel and golden syrup notes peek out.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
86,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Tobermory) 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,65,"An aged island dram to mull over during the distillery’s lengthy closure for essential upgrades, this brims with lemon sherbet, summer fruits including cantaloupe, and Bartlett pears poached in cream. Tangy citrus balanced with ginger and peppery spice, cocoa notes, and black bun make for a lively mouthfeel. Creamy fudge and Jaffa cake rule once the spices die back. An enchantingly delicate orange sorbet flavor appears when diluted.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
86,Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 23 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Caramel and cigar box lead the way, but leather comes in strong, followed by oak, earth, and mushrooms. On the palate, Nutella and roasted almonds resonate over crème brûlée, salt water taffy, vanilla icing, and nutmeg, with slight hints of apple and pineapple, at which point I think it really starts to pick up and take on some complexity. Alas, the short finish hurts what was a delightful experience.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
86,Westland Garryana Single Malt 2|1 (2017 edition),50.0,Craft Whiskey,150,"Aromas of woodsmoke with hints of hot tar and rubber are draped over ripe berry fruit. Dark and somewhat brash, it comes off a touch hot, fully revealing its 100 proof, becoming more fruit driven on the palate, as sweet berry, buckwheat honey, and sorghum syrup give way to smoldering baking spice on the drying, oak-laced finish. More muscle than finesse, however the 21% <em>Quercus garryana </em>is revealing itself more in this second iteration.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
86,Westland Peated Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"Briney sea air, wet stones, and pretty wisps of campfire smoke give this a strong Scottish bent, while the medium-bodied palate nicely balances the sweet malt, salt, and smoke in a bit of salt water taffy. Showing nice complexity and balance overall, the finish smolders and evolves to become more herbaceous.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
86,Union Horse Reunion Straight Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,38,"Craft skeptics will find this very aligned to mainstream bourbon, with its enticing nose of Peanut Chews candy, gooey caramel, and cocoa powder. The palate pours on sweet cornbread and marzipan, just a touch hot and slightly antiseptic, before the long finish of cherry and sweet vanilla. Lots of good stuff going on here.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
86,Copper Dog,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,32,"Named after the warehouseman’s preferred piece of pilfering paraphernalia, the 125 year old Craigellachie Hotel’s Copper Dog bar now boasts its own whisky. It’s an appealing blend of eight Speyside malts, with honey, warm toast, pecan nut, apple turnover, fudge fingers, and orange peel. Vanilla, orange pith, wood spice, caramel, and fresh apple develop into creamy nougat. Takes a while to come into focus, then concludes with a spicy finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Port Dundas) 26 year old 1990,,Single Grain Whisky,80,"Can it really be six years since the distillery closed and they demolished the chimney stack? This nose has a much stronger grain character than the other two Old Particular releases, so one to try before you buy. Beach driftwood and toasted spice aromas, with flavors of warm butterscotch, mandarin, and peach on a peppery base, shuffling into dried fruits and muscovado sugar before a spicy nougat finish. This is hardcore. (<em>K&amp;L Wines exclusive</em>, 243 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
86,Old Ripy,52.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Straw color and extremely light in aromatics, this whiskey starts earthy and goes spicy, with Hatch chili, allspice, and jalapeño cornbread leading the way. Then the sweeter side kicks in, with powdered sugar donuts, caramel chew, and vanilla latte coming through. Spice takes over toward the finish line in a hefty, medium finish. Perfect for cocktails. Price is per 375 ml.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
86,Glencadam Origin 1825,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,42,"New in 2016, this is an NAS entry-level bottling for the brand, matured in bourbon barrels before spending a finishing period in <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts. Sweet and malty on the nose, a hint of mash, then pineapple. Becoming more floral, with violets. The palate offers soft fruit notes, cocoa powder, light sherry, and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length, with milky coffee and soft spices.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
86,Black Bull 8 year old,50.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,39,"The youngest age statement Bull in the fold, this one has shredded citrus peel, fleshy grapefruit, candied orange peel, and lemon meringue pie. Soft fudge, honey, tart lemon, and buttery pastry with a nip of peppery spice under the tongue complete a satisfying combination. A delicious everyday kind of dram, and I preferred this expression’s brightness and attack of the flavors over the 12 year old.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
86,Kilchoman Sauternes Cask Matured,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This 2016 release follows similar port and Madeira quarter cask-matured Kilchomans, with sauternes casks being pressed into service this time. The casks in question were sourced from Château d’Yquem and the whisky is 5 years old. Earthy peat, a savory note, vanilla, citrus fruit, and sweet wine on the nose, while the palate offers smoked haddock, tarry rope, and bonfire embers. The finish is relatively long, with fruity peat. (6,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
86,Speyburn Bradan Orach,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,20,"Speyburn’s entry level NAS single malt takes its name from the Gaelic term for “golden salmon” and was matured in bourbon casks. The nose is light and youthful, with malt, vanilla, and unripe apples, while the palate offers more malt and vanilla, plus dry, spicy oak. The finish is medium in length and grassy, with ginger and further dry oak.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
86,The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Lossit,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,43,"The stills ran cold in this lost Islay distillery at Ballygrant in the 1860s. Excitingly acrid smoke on the nose: like fireworks or the smoking muzzle of a rifle mingled with summer lemons and crunchy green pear. Poached pears in cream, greengages, and peppercorns meet a stealthy, sour gooseberry takeover. Fades to a chalky, sour fruit plateau before a chili heat finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
86,Sea Fog American Whiskey,45.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"This whiskey portrays its coastal origin with a lovely sea-air quality that vies for attention with brown sugar, beeswax, and delicate smoke notes. Gentle peatiness weaves through the cocoa-tinged honeyed malt on the palate, culminating in a smoldering finish, where the mouthwatering saltiness seals the deal. Nicely integrated and well balanced, with fine pot still character. A single malt of pale and peated malts, aged 7 years in bourbon barrels.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
86,Hirsch Small Batch,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"This is unique in that it seems to be malt-forward, specifically floor malt, with oak and cinnamon following. But caramel enters the dance and does so in a big way. Nuances of <span class=""s1"">crème brûlée</span>, caramel popcorn, maple syrup, and caramelized corn with hints of cola, raspberry, and apple tart. While the flavor is here, the finish is just a touch short to put this in elite company. Nonetheless, it’s a decent sipper.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
86,The Distiller’s Safe,43.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,74,"Master distiller Brian Nation has the most vital job at Midleton. His distillate-driven whiskey is light, perfumed, floral, and ripe with succulent fruits of Galia melon, apricots, and citrus pith. A smooth, creamy mouthfeel of barley sugars, dried banana, and lime zest ends with light vanilla sponge and orange frosting. Sucked Jaffa segments make for a quick finish. The most distinctive of the Whisky Makers trio, where the grain and pot still contributions are clearly evident. €70",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2016 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,99,"A batch of OESO 12 year old, OBSV 12 year old, and OESK 16 year old. Normally, Four Roses expresses a near-patented cinnamon note up front with fruity undertones. Not this time. Earth, oak, powerfully rich caramel, nutmeg, vanilla, barrel char, with slight hints of grain, corn syrup, and cardamom. Finally, the quintessential cinnamon shows over a slightly disappointing medium finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
86,George T. Stagg,,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Distilled in 2001, this year’s release is a departure from recent releases, which were complex and nicely balanced. It’s more aggressive, with tannins and oak dominating, and lacking the body and sweetness to balance it. It’s my least favorite of this year’s offerings. Dark chocolate, toffee, tobacco, and dried fruit round out the palate and offer some comfort. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016",John Hansell,Winter 2016
86,Bladnoch Samsara,,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Samsara is a combination of 8 to 10 year old whiskies matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and California red wine hogsheads, bottled non-chill filtered. Initially slightly savory on the nose, then peaches and cream, and soft spices. The palate is supple and sweet, with vanilla, mango, and passion fruit. The finish is long, with spicy pears. Drier spices emerge and ultimately, light tannins. The red wine influence is greatly enhanced by the addition of a few drops of water. £60",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,Bunnahabhain Cruach-Mhóna,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This expression includes young, heavily-peated Bunnahabhain matured in bourbon barrels, mixed with 20 to 21 year old spirit aged in sherry butts. Fragrant, peppery peat on the early nose, brine and fabric Band-Aids. Ultimately, leathery orange. Smooth and supple on the palate, with intense, smoky fresh fruit giving way to quite dry spices. The relatively long finish yields drying peat, plain chocolate, and developing licorice. £80",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,Caol Ila 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,140,"Unpeated Caol Ilas have become a regular in the Special Releases portfolio and this expression from 2000 is the eleventh to appear. The early nose is reticent and faintly floral, with freshly sliced green apples. Sharp and sweet on the palate, with malt and citrus fruit, and even a hint of mint. Ginger, mixed nuts, aniseed, and more mint in the medium-length finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,GlenDronach Peated,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,48,"The first peated GlenDronach release, matured in bourbon barrels before a period in <i>oloroso</i> and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. The nose offers dry, earthy peat, then becomes quite perfumed, with vanilla and lime. Light to medium-bodied, with sweeter peat notes on the palate. Creamy, with honey, cinnamon sticks, and green apples. The finish is medium in length, with peat slowly fading and a flaring of spices near the close.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,Glenkinchie 24 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,450,"The third Special Releases cask strength Glenkinchie is the oldest to date and the first to have been matured in European oak casks. Peach and pear soufflé on the initial nose, followed by apricots and toffee. The palate is rich and smooth, with dark fruits, walnuts, nutmeg, and a hint of resin. Quite lengthy, with ginger and white pepper in the aromatic and subtly drying finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (5,928 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,Old Pulteney Dunnet Head,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,85,"Dunnet Head replaces Duncansby Head and consists of 80 percent sherry cask-matured whisky and 20 percent aged in bourbon wood. It is non-chill filtered. Soft caramel on the nose, plus a hint of fresh ginger and meadow hay. Sweet, spicy sherry and a heathery note on the nicely textured palate, with suggestions of citrus and salt. Medium in length, with lingering soft spices in the finish; ginger and cinnamon at the close. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive)</i>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,Tomatin Oloroso Sherry 1995,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,125,"This rested in bourbon barrels for almost 18 years until May 2013 when it was transferred to <i>oloroso</i> sherry hogsheads for a prolonged period of finishing. Big, waxy, warm leather notes on the nose, then dried fruit and machine oil. The palate is smooth, with cinnamon, cloves, sherry-soaked raisins, and dates. Spicy leather, plain chocolate, and slightly tannic oak in the very lengthy finish (1,800 bottles) £100",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,Super Nikka Revival,43.0,Japanese,52,"Masataka Taketsuru first blended Super Nikka in 1962 in tribute to his late Scottish wife Rita, and this limited edition pursues the flavors of the original. A dry nose of whole almond, honeycomb, woody herbal twigs, star anise, five-spice powder, and cut and dried peats. Lyle’s Golden Syrup flavors, baked apple, and raspberry coulis with a beautifully balanced, spicy accompaniment, incorporating lemongrass stalks and coconut flakes. Spicy fireworks, herbal remnants, and a slight peatiness make for a complete whisky. €49",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,Kavalan Distillery Reserve Peaty Cask,55.0,Taiwanese Whisky,49,"Whether it’s New York, London, Paris, or Yilan (home of Kavalan), this expression uses the fashionable technique of maturing unpeated spirit in former peaty whisky casks. Sweet, seasoned wood smoke, chocolate peat, dry spices (notably roasted coriander seed), citrus, and tropical fruits. A thick, warming, unctuous mouthfeel perfused with peat smoke, tangy grapefruit, and baked orange, ending on a fruity red licorice and gentle peat finish. Water unlocks moreish, honeyed citrus sweetness, with a peaty nip in the tail. (<i>Distillery exclusive</i>) NT$1,560",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,Hazelburn 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"This expression from Springbank Distillery is taking over from its highly regarded 12 year old sibling. It is unpeated, distilled three times, and matured in bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is gently floral, with pears, toffee, and soft oak, then emerging herbal tobacco notes. The palate is full and slightly oily, with cream, orchard fruits, cinnamon, and sea salt. The finish is long, with vanilla and cocoa powder.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
86,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 18 year old (batch 3),48.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,62,"A delicious and inviting proposition, this offers heather honey on toast, marmalade, dark vanilla, and flapjack aromas. Soft on the palate, there are gingersnaps dipped in thick-cut marmalade and runny caramels, though the ginger flavor muscles its way to the fore eventually. Water promotes more candied peel, before a spearmint conclusion. This is really enjoyable whisky for those lucky enough to get their hands on it. (30 bottles) £50",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,Belle Meade Cognac Cask,,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"This blend of 6 to 8 year old bourbon is finished for 3 to 4 months in casks that aged Cognac for 12 years. There’s fruit, especially dried apricot, pear, passion fruit, grapefruit, and cherry. Then caramel, oak, leather, tobacco, vanilla, and a slight hint of cinnamon. Honestly, there’s a textural brandy-and-bourbon struggle, but beautiful vanilla and nutmeg surface, ensuring it is indeed bourbon. A muted spice comes toward the end with rich caramel. Solid sipper.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
86,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1991,,Single Grain Whisky,175,"Vanilla ice cream drizzled in caramel and speared with a couple of wafers. Ground hazelnut, faint dashes of cinnamon, and garam masala complete the nose. A brief opener of rich toffee and tangy citrus is overrun with a piquant, acidic rush and nippy alcohol flare. It’s actually light in texture, and a largely absorbing experience, ending on some dusty marshmallow notes, though never losing the tanginess. Water accentuates the tangerine and mandarin but negates the mallow candy flavors. (264 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,West Cork Black Reserve,43.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,40,"The double-charred, first-fill bourbon casks deliver Madagascan vanilla paste, dark-roast cocoa beans, caramelized sugars, and a wedge of pecan pie. Heightened vanilla flavors, maple syrup, a little chocolate, coffee grains, sweet char, and those dark, sticky, softening pecans prized from the pie. Alternately sucking on vanilla pods and chewing leather bootstraps describes the finish. A one-trick pony, some might say, but it’s a highly distinctive and impressive steed all the same. (4,800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,Copperworks American Single Malt (release 001),52.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"The appealing nose features pretty biscuit notes, great purity of malt, and golden, honeyed sweetness, before adding some flavors of citrus blossom, clover, and cardamom with hints of licorice. On the palate, the initial sweet malt quickly turns herbal, with marjoram and a distinct sage note that lingers through a long finish of salt-tinged sweetness. Aged 2 years, 6 months in full-size charred oak.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
86,Spade & Bushel 10 year old,,Irish,40,"The Connacht Whiskey Company’s first release comes in small bottles, but it goes a long way. Whole lemons, yellow plum, pine floor cleaner, and a light smear of vanilla. Neat, there’s a real intensity of lemon-drenched sweet oak with a boiled candy finish, but it’s much more enjoyable brought down in strength. The soft fruits shine; it’s lemony though less acidic, and the barley notes show their best side. One of the tastiest sourced whiskeys on the Irish market. (5,000 bottles) Price is per 375 ml.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
86,Bowmore 25 year old Vintage Fèis Ìle (2016 Edition),,Single Malt Scotch,455,"This was a true double maturation: a dozen years in first-fill bourbon and then 13 years in claret. In its 20s, Bowmore tends to shed its smoke and allows the soft fruits (here, persimmon, nectarine) which have always been there to show themselves. There’s a light oiliness on the tongue. The casks have added vanilla, red fruits, and spice, but the overall impression is of harmony and integration. Lovely. (200 bottles) £350",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
86,Bruichladdich 2001 15 year old (2016-1881-135-PHD),50.0,Single Malt Scotch,123,"The official Fèis Ìle  2016 bottling. This is a mix of bourbon and wine casks given a period in virgin oak. The finish initially adds a certain sauna-like element, but then the distillery’s lemon drops and flowers come through, alongside baked apples, coconut, and a touch of smoke. The alcohol burn is negligible, allowing more estery elements, melon, and red fruits to come through. A classic Laddie, in other words. (1881 bottles) £95",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
86,Wemyss Malts Nuts about Pears 1991 (distilled at Blair Athol),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,150,"From Wemyss Malts’ Midsummer Single Cask Releases, this bottling from Blair Athol was distilled in 1991 and bottled in 2015. Soft, sweet fruits as the nose opens—principally juicy pears. This is backed up by malt and cinnamon. Very smooth and inviting on the palate, with honey, brittle toffee, gentle spices, darker malt, and walnuts. Slightly mouth-drying in the finish, with cocoa powder and lingering spice. (312 bottles) £115",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
86,Grand Traverse Islay Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"Once you get over any initial disappointment (there is no peat smoke), this is one engaging and mouthwatering whiskey; clean with malty cereal notes, golden raisins, bread dough, and freshly-sawn oak. The real clincher, however, is the captivating wisp of saline sea breeze echoing across a warming finish of cherry hard candies, rye spice, and salt brine. Medium-bodied, fresh, and delicious. <em>(Distillery only) </em>375ml",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
86,Stalk & Barrel 100% Rye (Cask 82),46.0,Canadian,70,"Seven years after distilling their first drop, Still Waters can barely keep up with demand. The single malt distillery took a giant step forward when partners Barry Stein and Barry Bernstein decided to mash some rye grain. Rye is now more than half of their production. Waxy, sizzling-hot spices and a lovely leafy sweetness lead to softer peppers, hints of vanilla, and a mildly floral palate. Linseed oil and a slippery palate suggest chocolate, but only just.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular 1988 (distilled at Glenturret),,Single Malt Scotch,144,"A 27 year old offering from Glenturret, in Perthshire, this bottling is from a refill hogshead that was filled in December 1988. Fresh mango and ripe peaches on the early nose, followed by a slightly smoky, earthy note. Viscous on the palate, with orchard fruit notes, coconut, caramel, and nutmeg. Drying in the finish, with mildly tannic oak, black pepper, and a final flourish of citrus. (264 bottles) £110",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular 1995 (distilled at Glen Garioch),,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Distilled in September 1995, and after 20 years maturing in a refill hogshead this Aberdeenshire single malt was bottled in February 2016. The nose is soft, with ginger, lots of floral notes, cinnamon, and vanilla. Sweet and malty on the mature palate, with banana, honey, milk chocolate, and cocoa, plus big cinnamon and nutmeg spice notes. Drying in the finish, with a drizzle of lemon juice and then black pepper. (254 bottles) £80",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 27 year old 1988,,Single Grain Whisky,124,"Buttery croissants, golden honey, peach stone, rye cracker bread, royal icing, vanilla essence, and dry oak. It’s sweet and sticky with icing sugar and yellow fruits before a scorching alcohol burn kicks in, lasting 30 seconds. It settles down to banana custard and vanilla, becoming tangy with candied peel, Turkish delight, and Edinburgh rock. The gum-tingling finish evaporates quickly. Careful—water disables the flavors all too easily, though adds some toasty spice and warmth. (192 bottles) £96",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
86,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Girvan) 27 year old 1988,,Single Malt Scotch,180,"An uplifting nose of golden honey, linseed oil, vanilla, sanded oak, and wheat biscuits on this west coast grain. Neat, it is mouth drenching. Banana and ripe fruits are followed by juicy orange before a snarling pepper onslaught ensnares the tip of the tongue, igniting a glowing ball of white heat underneath. You can bask in this experience for minutes with each sip. Water emphasizes the oak and mellows the dram to the flavor of almond-sprinkled custard. (180 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
86,Slaughter House American Whiskey,44.0,American Blended Whiskey,40,"Blend of 5 and 9 year old whiskeys aged in American oak and finished in Papillion (a French oak-aged red wine) barrels. There’s something to this, with orange zest, rose petals, honey, vanilla, and cotton candy. Then, a contradictory array of flavors abruptly changes the conversation. Think smoke: charcoal, campfire marshmallows, cinnamon, with hints of white pepper and tobacco plug. Its medium-spicy finish captivates me, even though palate and nose seem to be two different whiskeys. Very interesting. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
86,John Myer New York  Straight Bourbon Single Barrel,45.0,Craft Whiskey,42,"Crafted from estate-farmed organic grain and aged for 2 years. The flavors are impressively seamless, with nice complexity and everything neatly in its place. Fresh oak is well integrated with notes of orange rind, rosewater, sweet corn, and red fruits. The slick, buttery palate sizzles with peppery spice—cinnamon hearts candies and ginger. Robust in flavor, while showing impressive craftsmanship and polish. 375ml",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
86,Middle West Spirits Double Cask Collection OYO Oloroso Wheat (Batch 2),51.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"Lavish red fruit and sherry blanket this whiskey, initially aged in American oak barrels followed by 12-18 months in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks, to approach 5 years age in total. It may be the light toast of the initial barrels that allows this wheat whiskey to stand up exceptionally well, developing seamless flavors of figgy pudding, walnuts, chocolate-covered raisins, cacao nibs, and maple candy, culminating in a finish that nicely balances fruit and leathery oak. Carries its proof nicely.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
86,Laphroaig Lore,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,125,"Another NAS Laphroaig made from a blend of different cask types. The nose is dry and lightly tarry—a note that continues to the dried glass. There are medicinal phenols, a biscuity note, then an aroma of fuel, like being on a trawler deck. The palate shows integration between the oaks, lending a smokehouse aroma. Water lightens, but you still get that smoky smear of phenol at the end that tells you this is Laphroaig. Like it.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
86,High West Bourye,46.0,Miscellaneous,80,"When you close your eyes and think of an American whiskey, this is what it smells like: leather, caramel, vanilla, oak, and a hint of smoke. It becomes ever more interesting with introductions of citrus, baked fruit, and a hint of oregano; and then the baking spice and pepper follow the finish home.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
86,Wemyss Malts Seville Bazaar 1991 (distilled at Glen Scotia),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,129,"From a refill sherry butt, this bottling of Glen Scotia was released in September 2015 as a 24 year old. Oily on the nose, with dirty sherry, ginger, chili, coconut, new leather, and cocoa. The palate is viscous with treacle, dark berries, licorice, and more chili. Gingery and drying in the finish, with white salt and developing black pepper. (737 bottles) £90",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
86,Wemyss Malts The Highland Mariner (distilled at Clynelish) 1997,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,122,"This Clynelish was matured in a refill hogshead and has been released as part of Wemyss Malts’ Single Cask Releases series. The nose yields light caramel, ozone, warm tweed, and soft ginger. Smooth and supple on the palate; soft spices, tangerines, and subtle, spicy oak. Chili notes on the relatively long finish. (341 bottles) £85",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
86,Catoctin Creek Kings Mountain Single Barrel,46.0,Craft Whiskey,119,"Catoctin Creek’s first malt whiskey, made from wash brewed by Heritage Brewing of Manassas, Va., aged in used Catoctin Creek whiskey barrels. Light floral notes, fresh-cut pencil lead, oak sawdust on the nose. Sweet and floral, but with a firm backbone of oak and dry malt, leading to a finish of candied oak: juicy-sweet but hard-cored. The profile is definitely Catoctin Creek whiskey, which is great to see in a young distillery trying something new. Well done. <em>(</em>344 bottles<em>, distillery only)</em>",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
86,Ballantine’s 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,38,"Wow! A noticeable step up in quality than Ballantine’s Finest (<em>see below</em>) with a perceptibly higher malt content. After Eight mints, Rolo toffees, spring florals, clean and creamy, plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. One sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed, layered, thick, and creamy, with heather honey, sweet oak, and ripe fruits, especially orange and mango. The finish is short, drying, sweet, and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
86,Gordon & MacPhail Distillery Labels (distilled at Balblair) 10 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"Independent bottler Gordon &amp; MacPhail offers a variety of Balblair expressions, including a 1969 vintage and this 10 year old in their Distillery Labels series. Matured in a mixture of refill sherry hogsheads and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers rich, warm fruits, vanilla, sherry, maraschino cherries, and ultimately toffee and orange blossom. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity, with nutty milk chocolate, white pepper, and zesty spice. Slowly drying in the finish with licorice and light oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
86,The Gifted Horse,,Miscellaneous,50,"The mix: 38.5% Bernheim-distilled 17 year old Kentucky straight bourbon, 51% 4 year old bourbon, and 10.5% 4 year old corn whiskey. Kudos for the full disclosure. This whiskey doesn’t fit in a typical American box. Hard to assess color with used cooperage from corn whiskey, so stick to aroma and flavor here. Impressive beginning of fruits, roasted nuts, citrus, vanilla, cherry, spice, and undercooked cornbread, followed by a quick caramel burst. Tasty, even better with a splash of water.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Cameronbridge) 25 year old 1990,,Single Grain Whisky,119,"This refill butt has produced a perfumed and aromatic whisky with peach, green foliage, maize, a spritz of melon juice, and a pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg rubbed between the fingers. It’s zingy! Ginger sears the lips before the warmth of the ginger invades the mouth. The satin texture of honey and vanilla concludes with Spangles, before it enters a long, mouth-coating finish of sweet ginger. With water, soft, ripe fruit abounds; the ginger harmonizes rather than attacks. (282 bottles) £83",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
86,Virginia-Highland Port Finished Malt Whisky,46.0,Craft Whiskey,58,"Scottish Highland malt whisky (from an undisclosed source; no age given), finished in Virginia, in Virginia port barrels. Rich port fumes hit the nose, malt’s in the background. Well-behaved in the mouth, not overly hot or obviously youthful, and the malt’s oily and luscious, with a nice port wrapper. Finish is cleanly integrated, without any heavy wood. Nice whiskey, interesting idea. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
86,Glynnevan Double Barrelled Canadian Rye (Batch 2005.001),43.0,Canadian,34,"Distilled in western Canada, then shipped to Guysborough, Nova Scotia, Glynnevan is re-barreled for a final seaside stint. It’s authentic Seacoast Distilling Company-brewed beer prior to distilling into whisky. Brisk, spicy nose, with oak caramels, beeswax, hints of celery, and layers of green fruit. Luscious spicy palate loaded with citrus notes, vanilla beans, and pleasing bitter pith. Earthy, alongside wet slate and sweet spices. (<em>Canada only</em>) C$45",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
86,The Quiet Man 8 year old,40.0,Irish,50,"The nose on the single malt is spicier than their blend, with salted caramels and a smear of honey to boot. Key to the palate is the fresh fruitiness: melon, pear, and white grape. Additionally, there’s honey, a hefty malt presence, and spices keep things interesting. The finish of bruised fruit makes a greater impression at the back of the palate. Water emphasizes sweetness and blushing summer fruits. Great quality, though it doesn’t shout it from the rooftops.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
86,A.D. Laws Origins Bottled in Bond Four Grain Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,75,"Same mashbill as the Laws Four Grain, aged 4 years. Hard, dry corn aromas; no sulfur. Hot, straightforward corn and oak, with active spices. One of the leanest, most austere young bourbons I’ve ever tasted; no compromises, no lush sweetness: savory bourbon. The finish is great: tingling and tasty for a long time after the swallow. Not a bonded for cocktails; sip this.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
86,A.D. Laws Secale Single Barrel Cask Strength Straight Rye (Barrel #29),55.0,Craft Whiskey,90,"Mashbill of 95% rye, 5% malt; both Colorado-sourced. Aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Same grass and spice in the nose as the Straight Rye, but a sweet, almost sherry-like note as well. Flavors are similar—rye grain, bitter oil, alcohol heat—but there’s an added hit of dry cocoa, more heat, and a better, non-sticky finish with a grudging hint of sweetness at the end. Dialed up overall.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
86,Chivas Regal The Chivas Brothers’ Blend 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,58,"Intended to recreate the spirit of James and John Chivas, this blend uses high proportions of Longmorn and Strathisla malts. The nose has green apples, peaches in syrup, blended honey, and oat flapjacks. A soft and light opener of orange sherbet, melon, and dried apple. Dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. A distinctive character from the regular 12 year old, but this should be regarded as an equal. £40",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
86,Chivas Regal 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"The assured Scotch whisky that became one of the classic blends. Dry and sweet, with a nose of vanilla sponge, fresh cut flowers, and marzipan over a malty base. Pleasingly oily, with flavors of burning butter, malty toffee, and cake mix, with gentle spices and hints of chocolate appearing the longer you hold off swallowing. The glossy mouthfeel makes this feel like an everyday luxury. A finish of spent spices, cocoa, hazelnut, and a waft of smoke brings it home.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
86,Noah&#039;s Mill,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"From the folks at Willett distillery, Noah’s Mill has less than 20 barrels in a batch and will include 15 year old barrels in the dump. The deep amber color prepares the nose for what promises to be an exciting ride. Aromas of ginger, plums, cinnamon, fresh-baked cornbread, and fresh-squeezed cherries. The warm palate packs caramel, nutmeg, and vanilla with lovely cinnamon on the finish. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
86,Arran Smugglers’ Series Vol. 1 The Illicit Stills,,Single Malt Scotch,123,"Illicit Stills is the first in a trilogy of limited releases reflecting Arran’s distilling heritage. It includes unpeated Arran spirit, some of which has been aged in port pipes, along with amounts of medium-peated and heavily-peated whisky. Warm and rounded on the oily nose; figs and peat, before caramel and vanilla develop. Viscous in the mouth, with succulent orange and spicy peat. The finish is very long and peppery, with mouth-drying tannins. £85",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
86,Dalwhinnie 25 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2015),,Single Malt Scotch,480,"Distilled in 1989, this edition of Dalwhinnie is the fifth to appear in this annual line-up, and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. 5,196 bottles are available. Pine, vanilla, and honey on the nose. Sweet on the viscous palate, with unripe apples, pineapple, cinnamon, and honey. The finish is medium in length, slightly savory, with dark chocolate and a hint of sweet oak.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
86,Wemyss Malts Peat Chimney,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,54,"Imagine your nose hovering inches above well-dried peat, then throw in salted nuts, brittle toffee, and an intensification of vanilla pods. This feels more rounded and balanced than earlier bottlings and is the better for it. Warm, sweet caramel, juicy orange, and lime zest are shot through with peat, the rising smoke driving you back while pepper and ginger give close support. The most improved of the Wemyss three, but a bit more heft in the composition wouldn’t go amiss. £37",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
86,"Koval Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel 1,250)",47.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Certified organic, “aged under four years.” Oak is forward on the nose—young and fresh-sawn—with sweet spicy hard candies: cinnamon and teaberry. Juicy in the mouth: sweet, springing with that spice-fruit bounce off an oak board. Rye oil hides in the back, then slides forward with the oak to take over the finish. Dynamic. I haven&#039;t been a big Koval fan, but we&#039;re definitely on the right path here.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
86,Stalk & Barrel Rye (Cask 49),46.0,Canadian,70,"Rye flour, powerful rye spices—hot, sweet, and flavorful—bathed in flaxseed oil. Fragrant hints of breakfast tea blend with ripe dark fruit, peaches, and rich lilac perfume. Sweet and sour, and quite peppery, with a long finish. Made with nothing but rye grain, yet there is a certain slippery quality more commonly found in corn whisky. This is Still Waters distillery at its best.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
86,"Cody Road Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel 120,184)",,Craft Whiskey,45,"A 70/20/10% mashbill (corn/wheat/malt), aged 32 months. A sweet corn, citrus-tipped nose, not as hot as expected. Hot on the tongue, though, and spreads like fire. Dynamic balance of sweet corn and spicy candy with crimping oak spice and alcohol heat. Finish is like fireworks: a rush to an explosion of sweet, oaky heat in the back of the mouth, with a slow spark rain that sparkles on the tongue. Exciting.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
86,Douglas Laing 21 year old (distilled at Highland Park),,Single Malt Scotch,224,"This Highland Park bottling appears in Douglas Laing’s prestigious XOP range, and after distillation in September 1994 the spirit in question was matured in a single refill hogshead (#10897) before bottling in September 2015. The outturn is just 228 bottles. Boiled fruit sweets and malt on the nose, with underlying sea salt and gentle, leathery smoke. Confident in the mouth, with allspice, honey, barley, and wood smoke. The finish is lengthy, with drying oak and peat. £155",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
86,Detroit City Homegrown Rye,47.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Spicy, buttery nose (“aged six months with oak staves”) with some oak plank notes. Hey, that&#039;s pretty tasty! Rye character is spicy, forward, and flows surely right into the nicely warm finish. Michigan-grown rye done in a pot still in downtown Detroit, about a mile and a half from the Hiram Walker plant. Good young rye; one to watch.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
86,J.P. Wiser&#039;s Triple Barrel,40.0,Canadian,31,"Drinkers with a refined palate will enjoy the breadth and complexity of this whisky, the session drinker, its velvety smoothness. Barrel notes, from toasted vanilla to caramelized sugar and spicy cloves, give way to pickle-sour rye and bitter citrus pith. Searing peppers and ginger keep it exciting as dark fruits and black cherries fade to lime pith and peel. A long, glowing finish. <em>(Australia only) $43 AUD</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
86,Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon (Batch 15H664),,Bourbon/Tennessee,53,"Smells like bourbon—corn, a bit of cinnamon, oak—but there’s something else: a touch of doughy sweetness, a note of straight wood, a twist. Light and pleasant, with enough heat to keep it respectable (and likely alive in a cocktail); all the usual suspects are here, but without the heavier oak character. Afternoon bourbon.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
86,1792 Port Finish Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"The port finish is very evident but not overpowering. A fruit basket on the palate, with caramel apple, currants (red and black), bramble, apricot, toasted coconut, vanilla wafer, and anise. Rich and velvety in texture, with a long, gently sweet finish.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
86,Royal Brackla 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar &amp; Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.

The nose offers warm spices, walnuts, malt, peaches in cream, honey, vanilla, and a slightly herbal, earthy note. Quite robust on the palate for its strength, with spice, sweet sherry, and mildly smoky orchard fruit. The finish is relatively long, with cocoa powder, citrus fruit, and ginger.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
86,Tomatin Contrasting Casks Sherry Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,152,"Tomatin has released a limited edition (5,400) pack comprising two 350ml bottles, each containing a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006.

86,Master of Malt Single Cask Series (distilled at Loch Lomond) 18 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,135,"The strength is immediately apparent, though the nose has a curious mix of potato chips, tarragon, salt, and fizzy sherbet. The palate is more fruity, quite syrupy and sugary, with a lift of honeycomb and spicy ginger. It develops spiced orange notes, lime, soft summer fruits, vanilla, and Milka chocolate, encased in a thick, dense mouthfeel with nutmeg, dried peel, and powdered chocolate. A rumbustious dram at cask strength, but when tamed, it coaxes out ginger-sprinkled papaya and mango. (96 bottles) £89",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
86,Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Glentauchers,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"Glentauchers distillery is another Chivas Brothers workhorse located deep in the Speyside countryside. Through the aromas of honey, caramel, and vanilla peek barley stalks, hard pears, and hints of Cadbury buttons. The flavor opens sweet, with red berries and Parma violets. Although this is intended to follow a lighter style, it’s very flavorsome, with creamy vanilla, poached pear, and dried apple. A juicy finish with fruitiness oozing from the cheeks.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
86,Royal Salute The Eternal Reserve,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,180,"Let me introduce you to infinity blending. 88 casks were blended and married in 88 casks for 6 months, then blended with another 88 casks. Half is bottled, and half retained at Strathisla’s Royal Salute vault for the next batch. The process is as fascinating as the whisky. Caramel, toffee, green apple, Jaffa orange, and vanilla pod aromas. Dark sweetness, fresh orange accents: polished, juicy, and thirst quenching, though the brilliance lies in the amaranthine finish. (<em>Global Travel Retail only</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
86,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol lla) 2000,,Single Malt Scotch,120,"Identifiably Caol Ila, with that light juniper note, lime, and very calm smoke. This sense of control continues as it opens very slowly into vanilla/cream with a little hint of salt, then fresh lychee. It is hot, so do water as this introduces a massively salty retro-nasal effect under which is this sweetly gentle mid-palate. Lovely balance.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
86,The Cooper’s Choice (distilled at Ben Nevis) 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,115,"Distilled in 1996 and bottled in June 2015 after maturing in sherry casks, this Cooper’s Choice expression of Ben Nevis yields an initially savory character, with ripe figs, treacle, and a hint of tar. Quite chewy in the mouth, with spicy toffee and cherries, which develop into more citric fruit over time. The finish is lengthy and warming, with a hint of oak and black coffee.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
86,Kinahan’s Single Malt 10 year old,46.0,Irish,69,"200 years ago, Kinahan’s was the favorite tipple of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The small batch single malt has blackcurrant jellies, cinnamon sticks, dry oak spices, and baked raisins on the nose. An unctuous, succulent palate follows, with rich baked goods, roasted fruits, baked orange, cherry cola, black pepper, and chili flakes. Rounded, weighty, sweet, and rolling, this just laps up the water. Dark, oily finish with bitter chocolate. A single malt you can really get behind.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
86,J.P. Wiser’s Double Still Rye,,Canadian,22,"Blending two types of 100% rye with creamy corn whisky creates a complex dram that feels as good as it tastes. Sizzling peppers and nutty grains playfully torment fresh-cut cedar and dry oak, all on a comforting blanket of butterscotch. Street-roasted chestnuts and coffee beans bring depth. Pepper dominates, yet the mouth feels soft and sweet. Otherwise-muted fruity and floral notes blossom with a dash of water. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$29",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
86,Langside Distillers (distilled at Auchentoshan) 16 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,97,"Distilled in October 1997 and aged in a single refill hogshead, 360 bottles were released in 2014 as part of Langside’s Distiller’s Art range. The nose is mildly herbal, with green wood, heather, and developing soft toffee notes. Soft and gently spiced on the palate, with hazelnuts, and peaches in cream. The finish is relatively long, with milk chocolate, and tingling sweet spices. £62",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
86,Glen Scotia 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,85,"This 15 year old has been fully matured in bourbon casks. Relatively reticent on the nose, with light vanilla. Becoming more aromatic and spicy, with tinned apricots in syrup. Medium-bodied, relatively dry, with ginger, oak, and cloves, before a touch of milk chocolate appears. The chocolate darkens. Aniseed and perpetual spice.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
86,Glenfiddich 15 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"I used to find this a little lacking in structure. Either I’ve changed my palate (or was always wrong), or the solera’s slow changes have added depth and complexity. The nose is all cooked plums, with some blueberry, stewing rhubarb. All is delicately scented, with some currant leaf, then sultana and sweet dried fruits. The palate is equally fruity—more hedgerow fruits now—but there’s grip and a little fresh acidity to balance. Hugely appealing and approachable.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
86,Glenmorangie Duthac,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,86,"This Travel Retail-exclusive from Glenmorangie is the inaugural expression in the distiller’s new Legends series. Glenmorangie Duthac is matured in a mix of charred virgin oak and <em>Pedro Ximénez</em> sherry casks. Peaches, tangerines, cloves, vanilla, and toffee bonbons on the nose. Silky on the palate, with warm spices, honey, intense tropical fruit, and fresh ginger. Relatively long and creamy in the finish, with nutmeg, marzipan, and milk chocolate. Price is per liter.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
86,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glentauchers) 8 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,84,"Lightly grassy and hay-like, with some wheat chaff. The nose is quite hot, but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing, sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. The palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose, though retaining some nuttiness. Has good verve. When diluted, the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. A very interesting young ‘un. £54",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
86,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glentauchers) 11 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"A rare bottling from a distillery that is more commonly released as a part of whisky blends. Light fruit and sweet malt define the nose, with apple, apricot, and honey. The entry is bursting with flavor, centered around malt, along with honey, salt, and apricot. The mid-palate adds a touch of oak, smoke, and spice, and is extremely well integrated and balanced. A medium-length finish ends abruptly and a little too dry, the only left turn in an otherwise superb whisky. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
86,The Exclusive Malts 10 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 2005 (Cask #468),,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Extreme peat smoke explodes out of the glass. It’s diesely, burnt tire smoke more than campfire. Past the peat, there&#039;s salt, paste, and honey. On the palate it&#039;s another blast of smoke. This nearly chokingly strong smoke dissipates slightly to reveal oyster shells, malt, paste, and honey. Make no mistake, the smoke is the star and will remind you of that fact hours after you finish your last sip. An uber-peated whisky that hardcore peatheads will surely adore. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
86,Springbank Green 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"This bourbon-cask matured 12 year old was distilled using organic barley. 9,000 bottles released globally. Pears and pineapple in brine on the early nose. Peanut brittle, licorice, and subtle peat. Sweet and intensely fruity on the viscous palate, with developing nuttiness, vanilla, spice, and peat smoke. The finish is medium in length, with sweet fruit, more licorice, and sea salt.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
86,Mackmyra Sommartid,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,71,"Be more Swedish: escape the city and head to a rural, red-painted summer house with a tasty bottle of this little beauty tucked under your arm. A clean, fresh nose of marshmallows, Scottish tablet, warm spices, and reed matting. A thick, substantial palate with an array of lighter flavors; sweet barley sugar, honey, melon, vanilla frosting, gentle citrus, and spicy cinnamon. Great balance of power and delicacy here. The cinnamon rolls into a finish that really goes the distance. €65",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
86,The Antiquary 21 year old,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,100,"Consummately blended from more than 30 different whiskies, this has chewy Highland toffee, freshly-baked banana muffins, shelled walnuts, and faint chocolate orange notes. A smooth, full mouthful of blossoming orange, thick malt, heather honey, dabs of espresso, and milk chocolate. The malty Horlicks flavors prevail to the end with some attractive, shimmering spices. Note the higher strength here, though the 45% malt content is consistent across the range.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
86,Canadian Club Classic 12 (batch C12-014),40.0,Canadian,23,"Since Canadian Club refined its batching process, this 12 year old whisky has begun to show pleasing differences among batches. And though a batch is exactly that, a batch, bottling codes reveal that different bottle sizes of a single batch can be filled weeks apart. Caramel, dark fruits, and luscious sweetness jump out of the glass to fill the room. Behind that, the classic Canadian Club pruniness, butterscotch, and hot pepper ride on a wagonload of dried oak timber.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
86,Low Gap 100 Proof Whiskey,50.0,Craft Whiskey,75,"Made from malted Bavarian hard wheat and aged over 2 years in new and used American oak barrels, the nose is chocolate-covered pretzels and a dash of pepper spice with a slight edge. The entry is much softer than expected at this proof, driven by toasted wheat and dark chocolate, with vanilla and black pepper. A strong pepper kick at the end of the mid-palate drives a long, spicy finish. A surprisingly well-balanced and actualized young craft whiskey.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
86,Bushmills 16 year old,40.0,Irish,80,"The most northerly of Northern Ireland’s distilleries, Bushmills ages this spirit in bourbon and <em>oloroso</em> casks before finishing in port wine casks. The sweet notes of fat, ripe blueberries, plum flesh, and dusty, dry warehouses sketch out the nose. It lands on the tongue dry but piquant, then the fruit swarms all over it; blueberry, black currant, and apple, with hazelnut, chocolate pralines, black pepper, and spice. This was once the pick of the range, but the port influence seems feistier than older bottlings and I miss how smooth this used to taste.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
86,Bushmills Black Bush,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,35,"This is the whiskey that introduces the American journalist to Belfast drinking culture in Colin Bateman’s <em>Divorcing Jack</em>. The sherry cask maturation is the key; mouthwatering autumn fruits plucked from the trees, cinnamon-apple cobbler, and cocoa-dusted raisins. A smooth, glistening dram from the North Antrim coast; weighty and fruity, the sweetness turning to raisin chocolate bars. There is a lot to bite on. It slips away reluctantly, leaving a long, dark sweetness behind it. One glass is never enough.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
86,Chattanooga 1816 Cask,,Miscellaneous,40,"More nose than on the Reserve (see below); no surprise. Sweet spicy candy, alcohol heat, and oak. The spicy candy—clove, cinnamon, allspice—blooms in the mouth, firing up oak and corn, with a meaty fullness and a warming finish. Quite a bit more complex and interesting than the Reserve. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
86,Authentic Whisky Alsace Double Fût #2,40.0,French Whisky,49,"Meaning double cask, this was designed as an easy-drinking, summer style of Alsatian whisky created from a balanced proportion of two casks finished separately in local Riesling and Gewürztraminer barrels. The nose is light and crisp, with peach, pear, lime zest, grapefruit, gooseberry, and rose-flavored Turkish delight. A sweet, velutinous palate, sufficiently weighted with grapefruit and lime. A little malted barley pokes through the gooseberry. Quite distinctive, which counts in today’s market. €45",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
86,Smögen Primör,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,147,"Pär Caldenby makes this 45 ppm peated island whisky off Sweden’s west coast, maturing it in 110L capacity virgin European oak and Bordeaux casks. Lemon bonbon, vanilla pod, crisped bacon rind, and burnt toast crumbs are backed with a blackberry note. The longer I nose, the more the peat edges over the sweetness. Syrupy with an intense alcohol flare: apple, lemon, and vanilla sponge, but dilutes to ground ginger, citrus, and herbal notes. The smoke is unobtrusive. Young, promising, and gutsy. SEK 1276",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
86,John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2015 Edition,,Blended Scotch Whisky,805,"This second release celebrates Walker’s rare fruit character using 29 handpicked casks combining regional styles, aligned to the 2010 Director’s Blend. Aromas of pear and fresh apple layered over tangy, sugar-tossed dried fruits, pineapple, deep orange oils, and dry peel. Taciturn smoke. Creamy butteriness with red apple, raspberry, and sweet orange yields to soft, chewy pear skins, honey-drizzled Turkish delights, and charred paper. An outlier of JW character but important to contemplate how this adds context to the entire collection. £550",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
86,Wemyss Malts Snuffed Candle (distilled at Aberfeldy) 1999,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,129,"The first batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts in 2015 includes this 1999 bottling from Aberfeldy. The hogshead yielded 379 bottles. The nose opens with overripe bananas, followed by peaches, gingerbread, treacle, subtle smokiness, and vanilla custard. The whisky really earns its sobriquet with a waxy mouthfeel and a little more smoke, ripe eating apples, and ginger on the palate. The spicy finish dries slowly to plain chocolate and aniseed. £88",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
86,Wemyss Malts Foraged Fruit Fool (distilled at Blair Athol) 1991,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,176,"The oldest bottling in Wemyss Malts’ March 2015 batch of six releases, Foraged Fruit Fool was aged in a bourbon barrel. Orchard fruits, double cream, vanilla, and ginger on the enticing nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, supple, becoming nuttier, with gentle spices. The finish is quite lengthy, with fruit bonbons, allspice, and prickly oak. (330 bottles) £120",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Rich gold. Here we have a good example of Bunna’ in full ‘welcome home to a warm house after a cold walk’ mode. Warm, sweet, steamy, with a light mineral note, dried fruit, walnut, and that giveaway gingerbread signature. The palate is clean, spicy, and drier than the nose suggests, but has a soft center. A lovely dram for a chill summer evening. £75",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
86,Bomberger’s (batch 2),43.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"A blend: 89% 2 year 6 month old MGP bourbon, 11% 3 year old McKenzie rye. Other batches are different whiskeys. Sweet nose: some cinnamon and allspice, dried hay and “clear toy” candies. Hot on the tongue, with the spicy, peppery intensity of youth (and rye), and roars right on through to the end, where oak appears to add gravity to the finish. This would rock in a cocktail.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
86,Glendalough Double Barrel,42.0,Irish,35,"The single grain category gains another brother. This was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels, finished in Spanish <em>oloroso</em> sherry wood before being reduced with Wicklow mountain water. The nose oozes caramel, browned apple, grated nutmeg, black peppercorn, toasted coriander, and clove. A flash of mint is overtaken by a swath of caramel, apple, and pear drops orbiting the muscular spice kick of clove, pepper, and ground chili concentrated on the tongue. Kapow! One to pour blind to Talisker lovers.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
86,High West Valley Tan (Batch 2),42.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"High West has a second version of Valley Tan. The “Utah oat whiskey” was distilled to 87.5% (about the same proof as single pot still Irish, and technically a “light whiskey”), aged 2 to 4 years in new and used cooperage. A light golden color; nose is somewhat spicy, with a licorice/peppermint tinge and some alcohol heat. It&#039;s quite smooth, almost Irish in its drinkability, with grainy notes graced with that light peppermint and biscuit sweetness. Pleasant sipper indeed.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
86,Master of Malt Reference Series II,,Blended Scotch Whisky,85,"Now listen up class, it’s time for your next whisky lesson. Here the educational blend contains 20% very old single malt, which delivers a nose of citrus peel, honey, air-dried ham, and some spices in the background. Quite delicious, with orange, vanilla sponge, raisin, cremola foam assuaged by plain chocolate, and Black Forest gateau. This concoction is further tweaked three ways to complete Reference Series II. A truly great drink in its own right that makes learning fun again. £56",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
86,Blue Hanger 10th Blended Malt,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,100,"With some powerhouse whiskies in the blend (including an &#039;87 Bunnahabhain), it’s a surprise that the nose is so reserved, with citrus, ginger, and honey. On the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors, including leather, oak, salt, dark chocolate, and even <em>rancio</em>. It’s delicious but highly elusive. The finish is medium and quite dry. What an odd blend. I haven’t had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
86,Stalk & Barrel Cask 17 Rye,46.0,Canadian,70,"Rye grain, Bavarian sour rye bread, rich linseed oil, and vague hints of peppermint drift out of the bottle when you first pull the cork. The sweet, oily palate is alive with ginger and wasabi, accented by acetone, high fruity esters, and teasing hints of sweet flowers. Notes of plasticine and the earthiness of river plants add complexity. The whisky sizzles with pepper throughout, returning to sour rye as the finish fades ever so slowly.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
86,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Laphroaig) 8 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"What would you expect from an 8 year old Laphroaig? Iodine, massive peat, aggression? Not here. Rather, there’s a soft marine sweetness akin to lobster thermidor, with hints of salinity and tarragon. It builds in heft, and smoke, but there is real balance. Complex already. The palate initially shows muted smoke, and is slightly medicinal, with balancing creaminess. Water shatters this idyll somewhat, as the phenols come out in full force. It depends what side you want. I’d grab some. £60",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
86,Label 5 Extra Premium 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"This is bursting with barley, sweet oak, and all-butter shortbread. There are charcoal sticks too, which add a cool smoke note. The taste is like a warm hug on a cold morning; flavors of butter toffee, orange, poached pear, and ginger snaps, which combine to keep that deep smoke in balance. The harmony continues into the lengthy finish with flavors of citrus, melon, and ground ginger.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
86,Timorous Beastie,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,59,"This wee, sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous beastie is a blended malt of Highland whiskies from Douglas Laing, the latest of their regional recipes to join Scallywag and Big Peat. Perfumed soaps in muslin bags, dried sprigs of heather, beeswax, and Edinburgh rock give this an intriguing bouquet. Juicy: mandarins glow with green plums and Granny Smith apples. Ripe, yellow fruits and spices mid-palate conclude with sweet malt and fading creaminess sweeping around the gums. Distinctive and laudable. £39",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
86,Berry Bros. & Rudd Exceptional Casks (distilled at North British) 50 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,763,"Drawn from a pair of casks filled back in 1962, this brings out dried mango strips, white chocolate, melon, honeysuckle, and light vanilla with pepper and cumin around the fringes. Plenty to explore. Maple syrup flavors with plenty of thick tannins, but its vitality is intact. Darker, verging on bitter notes appear later on as it melds into rootsy, funky territory with burnt butter, deep vanilla, treacle, and spiced coffee. More wood with dry nuttiness on the finish. Leave off the water. £500",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
86,Bib & Tucker Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Mild and mellow nose of corn and oak, with a bit of warehouse reek, and a light, cleanly earthy note. Smooth and sweet in the mouth, with sweet cornmeal and sunny meadowgrass, a touch of candied cinnamon. A very friendly and easy-going bourbon, not too young, not too old. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
86,Dark Horse Reunion Rye Barrel Strength,,Craft Whiskey,62,"A rare barrel strength 100% rye release from a craft distiller. (Dark Horse, Lenexa, Kan.) No age statement on this other than “less than four years.” Young wood leads things off with pencil, graphite, and sawdust. Once you get past the sharp wood, there’s lush maple, brown sugar, cinnamon, and rye spice. At 113 proof it’s still soft, supple, and lush but slightly tannic. The finish is spicy but not overly hot or dry. Great distilling hampered by small barrels, but still something special.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
86,Bruichladdich Octomore 7.1,,Single Malt Scotch,168,"Distilled in 2009, so remember this is only 5 years old. At this stage there’s not a lot of cask, but there is an insanely intense smoky, herbal note like eucalyptus, celery, spruce, pine resin, then some angelica and a crisp mineral edge. The palate is balanced between this intensity, big smoke, and Bruichladdich’s typical oily, sweet core. Water doesn’t affect it one little bit. It is bold, it is proud, it is in charge. I like its sheer ballsiness. £110",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
86,Aberfeldy 18 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,130,"This expression of Aberfeldy fits between the core 12 and 21 year old bottlings, but is exclusively available in Travel Retail outlets. The nose opens with a slightly savory note, rich and spicy, with sherry, Jaffa oranges, and sweet oak. The palate is smooth and rounded, with malt, nutty spice, honey, and milky coffee. The finish is lengthy, with Seville oranges, plain chocolate, dark sherry notes, and licorice. (<em>Travel Retail only) </em>Price is per liter.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Arran Sherry Premium Single Cask 1997 #217,,Single Malt Scotch,125,"This single sherry cask bottling from Arran was distilled on February 17<sup>th</sup>, 1997, being bottled on February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2014. The nose opens with a hint of malt vinegar, followed by sherry and sultanas. More floral with time. Full-bodied, with spicy sherry, figs, and raisins. Long and spicy in the finish, with fruity sherry to the end. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Glenfiddich 26 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,500,"Pale straw in color, and while it is clean and fresh, it’s also very delicate, with elderflower blossom, dusty florals, and a freshly-starched linen note. All rather discreet, shy even, but effort reveals a subtly lovely dram. Water adds a perfumed, green note. As the nose suggests, it’s not an immediate thruster of a malt, with some light jasmine tea and a little fleshy fruit on the end. Tread cautiously, lest you scare it.",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
86,Cù Bòcan Sherry Cask,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Mashy peat notes on the early nose, then sherry, vanilla, and white pepper. Mouth-coating, with new leather and sweet spices on the palate. Gentle smokiness and black coffee gradually come to the fore. The finish is medium in length, with sweet, nutty peat which gradually dries.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Cuatro Series Manzanilla,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Initially drier on the nose than the Fino expression, then caramel appears, along with milk chocolate and vanilla. More pronounced leathery notes than the Fino; fuller bodied and fruitier on the palate, with the fruit developing a salty tang. Lingering salty fruit and spices in the finish, with final dark chocolate.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Cuatro Series Pedro Ximenez,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Full sherry and old leather on the nose. Dried fruits, and finally a hint of meat extract. Rich, sweet, and sherried on the palate, with nutty spices. Medium to long in the spicy finish, with black currant and raisin notes.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Mackmyra Moment Malström,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,162,"Mackmyra has used 30-liter casks held underground in the Bodås mine, the archipelago repository on Fjäderholmarna, and the forest repository in the Whisky Village in Gävle. Bruised banana, ground almond, Horlicks, spearmint, and budding foliage characterize the nose. The fruity whirlpool of flavor includes apple, watermelon, and poached pears, a second wave of dried fruits and fudge, all anchored by a clean edge of Kendal mint cake. Bubblegum on dilution. A final rush of coffee/cocoa before a sweet, juicy finish. €130",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
86,Wemyss Malts At Anchor in a Cove 1991 (distilled at Glen Scotia),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,159,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes this 22 year old expression of Glen Scotia, matured in a bourbon barrel that provided 304 bottles. The nose offers soft spices, orchard fruits, and a faint hint of ozone. Richly fruity on the palate, with mandarin oranges, vanilla, and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish is gingery and warming, with light smoke, aniseed, and plain chocolate at the close. £100",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Singleton of Glendullan 38 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,1250,"Mature on the nose, mixing the tropical fruits of age with blanched almond. As it opens, you encounter Moscato grapes dusted with white pepper. Grows in sweetness. The palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character, given a waxy coating by age. Unctuous and good. Water rather pulls the flesh from the bones, revealing its age, so leave well enough alone. (3,756 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
86,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dalmore) 18 year old 1996 Cask # 2097,,Single Malt Scotch,150,"This cask strength whisky is malty in the nose, along with peach, nectarine, and subtle oak. The entry is all malt, the kind of flavor that evokes ""malt reverence."" In the mid-palate it’s cereal grains spiced with allspice and black pepper. The finish is long and slightly salty, with a fair amount of heat from the alcohol, and a touch of oak. If you love the singular flavor of malt, this one may be for you. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
86,Signatory Un-Chillfiltered Collection 11 year old (distilled at Edradour),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,67,"Cask # 1013 from Edradour was filled on March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2002 and bottled on February 26<sup>th</sup>, 2014 at 11 years of age. It has not been chill filtered and is offered at natural color. The nose yields sultanas, cloves, and sherry, plus an earthy aroma and a hint of machine oil. The palate is silky, with sweet sherry, digestive biscuits, soft spices, dates, and figs. The finish is medium and fruity, with dark chocolate-covered candy. £42",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
86,Aultmore 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,199,"Light amber with that touch of acetone, along with marzipan, green apple, fruit blossom, and a runny caramel toffee/crème brûlée which adds width, while toasty oak and ginger biscuit give structure and spice. Again, a lovely, almost oily feel — it’s Dewar’s equivalent of Linkwood — balancing fragrance with surprising depth in the mouth. Water brings the oak into play and tightens the palate. <em>(Travel Retail only) </em>£125",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
86,Hillrock Single Malt Barrel 4,43.0,Craft Whiskey,100,"Razor-sharp aromas of clove, seasoned wood, and dried grass push firmly out of the glass. Hard-edged grain and spice continue on the palate, but without the harshness you might expect from young whiskey with such a bold nose. It softens toward the finish and becomes sweeter, with a hint of buttery fudge, then develops an oaky dryness at the end. Impressive young whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
86,Colkegan Single Malt,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Sweet malt, old fruit pastilles (less intense), and subtle mesquite smoke. Unlike some craft smoked whiskeys, this doesn’t grab you by the throat; it’s enticing. Bigger on the tongue, but still not overwhelming, and there’s some dark, spicy chocolate and pepper coming out.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
86,Wemyss Malts Lemon Zest 1998 (distilled at Auchentoshan),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,126,"Wemyss Malts has bottled several single cask Auchentoshans in the past, and this 15 year old release is of 342 bottles, provided by a bourbon barrel. Peaches, caramel, sea salt, and developing lemonade on the nose. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with more peaches and very soft background spices. The finish dries slowly, with ginger and a hint of aniseed. £75",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
86,Bunnahabhain Westering Home 17 year old Feis Ile 2014 bottling,,Single Malt Scotch,421,"Matured in cognac before being finished in Sauternes; here we have a clean, sweet, and well-rounded Bunna’, with hickory-like smoke, bonfire, and ginger biscuits. Lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick, citric sweetness. Immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice, Seville orange, apricot, cheesecake base, hazelnut, red fruits, and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. Lovely. £250",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
86,Wemyss Malts Apple Basket 1997 (distilled at Clynelish),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,126,"The latest Wemyss Malts single cask offering from Clynelish distillery is a 16 year old expression, matured in a hogshead which gave an out-turn of 339 bottles. The nose offers sea salt and lemon, with emerging green apples and vanilla. Apple tart with custard and a dusting of cinnamon on the palate. The finish is long and peppery, with a hint of freshly-ground coffee beans. £75",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
86,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1978 (Cask #4004),,Single Malt Scotch,589,"The color is light gold, the nose is very sweet and delicate, with a floral aspect that’s not always immediately apparent in Glenfarclas. This is from a fourth-fill hogshead, which provides creaminess, toffee, a little hint of orchid, burnt cream, and grilled peach. Sweetly delicious. The palate is akin to bread-and-butter pudding, with that creaminess continuing. All very summery and ‘up.’ Quite different, but appealing. £350",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
86,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1984 (Cask #6032),47.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Delicate, with some jasmine, lily of the valley, and even, with time, the rich aldehydes of Chanel No.5. This heaviness gives a butterscotch-like quality when water’s added, alongside apple. The palate is thicker than the light color suggests—it’s from a fourth-fill hogshead—with overripe pear and white chocolate; with water, becomes scented with an added touch of marzipan and chestnut puree. One for a thoughtful afternoon’s contemplation. £760",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
86,Glen Garioch Wine Cask Matured,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,170,"This is the first expression from Glen Garioch to have been fully matured in wine casks, specifically <em>tonneaux de vin rouge</em> barriques from Saint-Julien in Bordeaux. The whisky was distilled on June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1998, and spent over 15 years in the Bordeaux wood. Milk chocolate-coated caramels, crystallized ginger, and cranberries on the nose. Autumn berries on the early palate, turning to cough syrup, with rich malt and lively chocolate spiciness. Caramel merges with white pepper in the relatively long finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
86,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glenrothes) 1996,,Single Malt Scotch,140,"A very immediate, expressive, sweet start, with manuka honey dribbling on top of baked fruits, sweet citrus, and a dollop of clotted cream on the side. All very luscious and calorific. As if this dessert theme wasn’t sufficient, the palate lays it on even more thickly, with apricot now joining the mass of fruits. The light grip adds very necessary structure and stops things getting floppy. One for those with a sweet tooth. Recommended.(<em>U.S. only</em>)",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
86,"A.D. Rattray 22 year old (distilled at Littlemill, Cask #558)",,Single Malt Scotch,160,"A non-chill filtered, cask strength single malt from Littlemill, vintage 1991. Littlemill’s sweet nose is inviting, with butter toffee, milk chocolate, dried apricot, and straw. On the palate, these notes are joined by a nice maltiness as well as a touch of salt. In the mid-palate we get a touch of spice (black pepper and cinnamon) and some citrus. The finish is medium-length and slightly acidic, a departure for an otherwise affable cask strength whisky. (<em>Park Avenue Liquor only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular Ledaig 1993 (distilled at Tobermory),,Single Malt Scotch,185,"This 21 year old from Tobermory is of the peated Ledaig variety, though sampling confirms that the level of peating in Ledaig malt has been significantly ramped up since this was produced. Sweet on the nose, with subtle aromatic smoke, unsalted butter, peaches in syrup, and heather honey. Luscious and viscous on the sweet, fruity palate, with honey, underlying soft spices, and some gentle smoke. Slowly drying in the finish to licorice root and black coffee. £110",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
86,Tomatin 14 year old Port Wood Finish,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"This portwood finish from Tomatin was matured for some 13 years in bourbon casks before being transferred for a final period of aging in Portuguese tawny port pipes, which had matured port for between 30 and 40 years. Initially reticent on the nose, with soft fruit notes, honey, and toffee, turning to cherry cough lozenges. Gently spiced on the nutty palate, with peaches and Cherryade. The finish is medium in length and always fruity.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
86,Glann ar Mor 1an Gwech 14,46.0,French Whisky,80,"Only four first-fill bourbon barrels have been disgorged for this year’s unpeated release, so be quick. Vanilla frosting, marzipan, white pepper, and coconut snowballs emit from the glass. The mouthfeel has a satin sheen, with flavors of sweet honey, peach syrup, orange segments, ground pepper, and some almond nuttiness. It holds its poise as it gently dilutes, comforting like a warm blanket over your taste buds. A few drops of water produce a rounder, sweeter experience. €60",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
86,Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond 6 year old,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,15,"Sweet reek of the warehouse; sugary bourbon drooling and drying on oak staves, the richly boozy air, dusty wood. It’s all here, like Bardstown in a bottle. Enters with authority, a hot rush of corn, solidly oak-edged, sizzling with allspice and cinnamon, and backed with a solid strop of leather. Then the sun comes up: a sweet, glowing finish. Beautifully bridges the gap between young and old bourbon, and an absolute steal at the price.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
86,Benjamin Prichard’s Rye,40.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"An unabashedly spicy rye nose backed by cinnamon, marzipan, Bartlett pear, and oak. The rye spice is right there on the palate and immediately joined by cinnamon, clove, black pepper, solid oak, and a lingering pear note on the fringe. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with a hint of black licorice candy. Pritchard’s rye is a perfect example of how you can have strong spice without a lot of fire, and create balance without adding a lot of sweetness.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
86,383 Wink & Nod (distilled at Grandten Distilling),,Craft Whiskey,50,"Single barrel releases aren’t uncommon at craft bars, but a whiskey distilled by the bar’s proprietor is rare. Dark amber color suggests high barrel impact, but the wood is actually well balanced by caramel, milk chocolate, and honey-nut cereal. The opening is much softer, lusher than you’d expect at this proof, and balances in the mid-palate with oak, salt, cinnamon, and a little heat. A dry finish rounds out a unique and flavorful whiskey. <em>(less than 50 bottles; Grandten Distilling’s South Boston store only)</em>",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
86,The Irishman Cask Strength,54.0,Irish,150,"Bernard Walsh hand selects the 12 year old whiskey for this bottling, using only first-fill bourbon casks. The rich, tawny color has a nose of caramelizing sugars, gingersnaps, peanut brittle, and stewed fruits of apple and rhubarb. Rich flavors of butterscotch caramels, orange twist, oak, and that ginger intensity which persists with a slight bitterness. There’s a big hit of grapefruit as it reaches its zenith, before it mellows to a dry, nutty conclusion. (2,200 bottles to be released annually)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
86,Berentzen Bushel & Barrel,30.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,22,"Most flavored whiskeys start with an existing whiskey and add flavoring, but Bushel &amp; Barrel comes at it from the other end, mixing Berentzen’s apple liqueur with a Kentucky bourbon. Bright, crisp apple cider defines the opening, while in the mid-palate subtle bourbon notes emerge with vanilla, honey, cinnamon, and light oak. The bourbon notes complement the sweet apple cider and help keep things from getting too sweet. Bourbon and cider have always been buddies, and they do quite well together here.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
86,Highland Park Freya 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,235,"Freya is the third release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection; unusually, it has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. It fits into the core range between the 12 and 18 year olds. The nose is sweet, floral, and heathery, with pineapple, mango, and a background earthiness. Finally, vanilla and milk chocolate. Smooth on the palate, with passion fruit, and more overt peatiness than is apparent on the nose. Subtle peat, char, and a hint of licorice in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
86,Mortlach 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,1013,"The richest of the quartet. Super-dense with a note of burnished brass, then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. The waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old whiskies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. The palate starts sweetly, with added liqueur cherries, earth, and smoke but for me, after the complex nose it fails to deliver, especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
86,Amrut PX Sherry Single Cask #2702,,Indian Whisky,130,"The first of three Iron Dram single cask Amrut whiskies released for the European market. The <em>Pedro Ximénez</em> cask certainly has the upper hand here. Black cherry, dried cranberry, blueberry, and mixed peel mingle with apple peelings, baked pear, thick-skinned sultanas, and chocolate frosting. Tart piquancy to the fore on the palate, but it melts to show glacé cherry, baked apples, pear, and ground almonds. Water brings the childhood sweetness of old-fashioned Kola Kubes. Oodles of character. £77",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
86,Royal Lochnagar Triple Matured Edition,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"Diageo is releasing five triple matured single malts, all exclusive to Friends of the Classic Malts and without age statements. Initial maturation was in refill casks, followed by a period in charred American oak hogsheads, and finally European oak refill casks. Sweet on the nose, with heather honey and gingerbread; slightly herbal. Resinous and waxy. Cloves, cinnamon, oak, and black pepper notes on the buttery palate. Medium length in the finish, with lingering cloves and freshly-sawn oak. £80",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
86,Abraham Bowman Double Barrel Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Hot wet oak, berries, Red Hots, and wet cornmeal. Closer to the nose, it’s sharper and woodier. Lots of wood on the entry, but sweet corn and cloved hard candy, too, with heat from the 100 proof that lingers through the oaky finish. At 7 years, this is extra-spicy, and a touch of water tames the heat and the oak. Bowman’s still finding its way, but the path seems right.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Highland Park) 18 year old cask #0074,,Single Malt Scotch,169,"The Old Particular non-chill filtered single cask expression of Highland Park was distilled in November 1995, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in December 2013. The outturn was 322 bottles. Initially quite reticent on the nose, then toffee, cardboard, table salt, and very faint smoke. Quite viscous on the palate, and dry peat becomes relatively prominent, with allspice and sea salt. The finish offers licorice and lingering spices. £100",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
86,Signatory Cask Strength Collection (distilled at Cambus) 22 year old 1991,,Single Grain Whisky,110,"The closed grain distillery niche is small, but Cambus rightly has its followers. The latest in a series of sequential cask releases from Signatory, this refill butt signals a grassy nose of green hay bales, tangerine, potting compost, white pepper, and almond-studded nougat. To drink, it’s like joyously biting into a tangerine marshmallow, to be rewarded with thick cloudy puffs of flavor with a peppery accompaniment.  Dabble with the water to reveal the delights of orange creamsicle pie. £65",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
86,Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Clynelish) 1996,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,101,"A 1996 expression is the latest Clynelish to take its place in the Connoisseurs’ Choice lineup. Maturation occurred in refill sherry butts. Fruity on the nose, with ripe bananas, malt, dark toffee, lemongrass, and a splash of brine. Ultimately, a green, herbal note. Relatively full-bodied, creamy and slightly waxy on the palate; spicy sherry, Golden Delicious apples, and old leather. The finish is medium to long, with lingering ginger. £60",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
86,Glen Deveron 16 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Sweet on the nose, with malt, stewed apple, apricots, sherry, and warm spices. Finally, caramel. Quite viscous in the mouth; the palate continues the sweet, malty, spicy theme. Ginger and soft fruits in the medium-length finish. Straightforward and very drinkable. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £46/liter",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
86,Grand Macnish 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"With a bottle shape that makes you want to go bowling, this blend has admirable balance between the fruit and the smoke on the nose. The bonfire smoke is matched with aromas of tarte tartin, pecan nut, red apple, and sultana. Smooth and molten in the mouth, it has more weight and body than its older brother. There is citrus, apples, and the late arrival of baked spices, cookie dough, and mint chocolate on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
86,Catskill Buckwheat Otay,,Craft Whiskey,35,"While it’s not technically a grain, buckwheat makes great pancakes, so buckwheat whiskey? Otay! This has an earthy aroma of hickory nuts and autumn leaves with some cinnamon peeking through; reminds me of Corsair’s quinoa whiskey. There’s a cushioned, creamy mouthfeel, more raw nuts, a keen of oak, a sweet lift through the mouth, and at the end, the leaves and more oak. Unique, intriguing, compelling; I keep going back for one more taste. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
86,Wemyss Malts Tarte au Citron (distilled at Auchentoshan) 1998,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"The latest single cask expression of Auchentoshan from Wemyss Malts is 14 years old and was matured in a bourbon barrel. The outturn is 342 bottles. The nose is fleetingly herbal; then offers crème de citron, turning to tinned peaches in syrup, and finally pine and peppery caramel. Silky-smooth in the mouth, spicy, with lemon and digestive biscuits. Freshly-squeezed lemon lingers in the chili and chocolaty finish. £78",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
86,Br5 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bruichladdich),,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The nose is slightly closed, all very delicate, with some hay-like aromas akin to harvest time. This gentleness allows sweet melon-like fruits to come through, alongside patisserie, icing, gentle vanilla, and an effect like Hedione, the ‘smell’ of sunshine. Rounded and very sweet, typical of the distillery, with a lightly drying effect similar to powdered icing sugar. It slightly loses it with water, so keep neat. A pleasant, straight down the middle Laddie. £60/500 ml",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
86,Lagavulin 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,119,"Though as pale as ever, this Lagavulin is hardly in need of a Charles Atlas course. The nose is ozonic, like rock pools at low tide with kelp splattered around. Sweetness comes in the form of cloudy apple juice and a smokehouse kipperiness. The palate is explosive, with masses of retronasal action showing violet root, thyme, juniper, tarragon/fennel, and a finish akin to smoked cheese. An improvement on the 2012 release.",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
86,Duncansby Head,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Duncansby Head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and Spanish sherry casks. The nose is initially slightly earthy; then Old Pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly, along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins. The palate is smooth and chewy, with sherry making its presence felt along with cooked apples, oranges, sultanas, nutmeg, and cocoa. The finish is spicy and nicely rounded. £45/liter",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
86,Charbay Whiskey Release III,,Craft Whiskey,425,"After 6 years aging in charred new oak, and 8 years in “non-oak vessels” (stainless tanks), there’s a nose of oak, cedar, tart red plums, gooseberries, and fresh putty, but none of the heat you’d expect. Explosive in the mouth: sweet fruit and dry oak slam-dance and set off a surprising burst of hops (wash was craft-brewed pilsner). Exciting stuff, but a bit hot, even with water. <i>(2,713 bottles released)</i>",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
86,Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Select,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,165,"This new Jack Daniel’s offering is marketed as being “bold and smooth.” It certainly is bolder when compared to the standard Jack Daniel’s offering, with a mélange of corn, creamy vanilla, toasted caramel, bright citrus, and dry resinous oak spiked with cinnamon. The smoothness ends, however, when the oak grip intensifies on the finish. Adding ice does tame the oak, if that’s your thing. Still, I’d prefer the oak be more restrained. Price is per liter.",John Hansell,Spring 2014
86,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 105,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Drier on the palate than the 90, with more caramel than honey, and more oak spice (especially vanilla) and grip on the finish. Still, rather light in personality. However, I’m looking for more sweet notes to partner with the dried spice. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Blair Athol) 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,129,"This single cask bottling was distilled in February 1993 and matured for 20 years in a sherry butt. Rich and spicy on the nose: peel, dates, and sultanas. More floral in time. A silky mouthfeel, major spice notes, ginger, and sweet sherry. Long in the finish, with nutmeg and plain chocolate cherry liqueur.£80",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
86,Bowmore 23 year old Port Wood,,Single Malt Scotch,630,"The ruby color gives the port maturation away, as does the nose: all plum crumble, stewed rhubarb, and caramelized orchard fruits. It’s more autumnal than jammy with hints of dusty angelica and only vestigial smoke. The palate is hot, with those hedgerow fruits and a light touch of perfumed lavender before a flock of tarry smoke appears on the finish. All well-integrated and at its best with a little water.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Bruichladdich Scottish Barley,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,68,"This has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose, with the distillery’s sweet, lemon-fresh/floral core still evident, but skewed more toward roasted notes, like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. Water brings out meadowsweet. Raspberries lead on the palate, contrasting with the crisp, nutty chaff notes. It’s citric and gingery on the finish, but has drive and energy. £42",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Glencadam The Exceptional 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Clearly sharing the same DNA as the 10 year old expression, this variant has less overt pear drops on the nose, which is altogether more floral and complex, with ripe oranges, pineapple, and an herbal note. Elegant on the palate, with orange, vanilla; and contrasting dark berries, black pepper, and oak. The finish is lengthy and slightly oily. £57",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
86,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glendullan) 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"I always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. This is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a Whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy, fresh chlorophyll, coumarin, lime. These scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. A rolling prairie in the mouth, and best neat.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Glenfiddich Reserve Cask,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Here, a new solera vat is home to a Glenfiddich that has been exclusively aged in sherry casks, and shows its origins with deep, black fruitiness, orange peel, and sultana. The signature pears of ’Fiddich

here are dried and sit next to moist fruitcake. Ripe and long, with toffee, a pleasant wisp of sulfur, and blackberry. An easy-going sherried style that’s ideal for the beginner. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>£49/1 liter",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Glenfiddich Select Cask,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,62,"Another from Glenfiddich’s three new solera vats, here we can see the distillery’s light character turned up to the max thanks to a mix of American oak, red wine casks, and a smidgen of sherry. Think of hyacinth, ultra-fresh William pear, light barley, and grass. Zesty, clean and light, and ridiculously drinkable with a silky feel in the middle of the tongue. Quite a bargain. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>£39/1 liter",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Sigurd,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,202,"Heather honey, malt, newly-cut hay, pineapple, and very slight smoke on the nose. Leather, malt, cinnamon, a touch of oak and soft smokiness on the palate. Medium in length, with a hint of honey behind the oak, spice, and smoke. (<i>Travel Retail exclusive.)</i> €150",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
86,Nikka Coffey Grain single cask 1999,60.0,Japanese,196,"Distilled, as the name suggests, in a (Glasgow-built) Coffey still at the Miyagikyo distillery, here we have a corn-based grain with masses of gentle custard tart aromas alongside peach and corn fatness. The mouth is ripe and slow, with banana skin and fruit peels leading to a mellow mid-palate section, where vanilla comes through. It’s all about the feel. €145",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Douglas Laing Old Particular Range (distilled at Auchroisk) 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,120,"Here is Auchroisk at its more lifted and clean. A whiff of cooking lentils (a lovely smell) alongside lime and cottage cheese (again nice), it gives the impression of a healthy salad. The palate is sweet and quite buttery, with minimal attention from oak; instead it’s all very spring-like, with good mid-palate sweetness. Water dries it slightly, but also extends the palate. Quite lovely.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
86,Blue Hanger 8th Release,,Blended Scotch Whisky,115,"This breaks Blue Hanger ranks because it's a traditional blended whisky rather than a blend of just malts. Not that you see the joins. This is a rich, powerful, clean, and crisp whisky with a delightfully balanced flavor of pureed fruits and an unusual, almost menthol quality. Smoke wanders in and out to complete the experience. <i>(The Whisky Shop exclusive.)</i>",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
86,Highwood Ninety 5 year old,45.0,Canadian,28,"In June 2013, flooding washed away most of Highwood’s finished whisky. Although barrels in the warehouse went unscathed, new releases such as this one have been limited. Too bad. Initial nose tickle erupts into sweet caramel and rich black fruits. Hot pepper trickling down your throat leaves a lovely hot burn followed by waves of sweet saltwater taffy. Yes, it’s slightly salty. Weighty and mouth-coating, this whisky feels big and full in the mouth. (<i>Alberta/British Columbia only.) C$28</i>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
86,Teeling The Gathering 11 year old,46.0,Irish,90,"Cooley produced some great Irish single malt whiskeys and this is no slouch, either. It pulls off the trick of being both very Irish, with sweet, lush pear, fermenting apple, and yellow fruit notes; and of being distinctively a single malt, mainly because the barley is held in check by just enough influence of tannin and spice. It's a bit like a fruit cordial, and the oak doesn't overstay its welcome. A nice pepper flourish in the finish.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
86,Buckhorn,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"Full oaky nose, with the brash power of youth. Zingy and bright, with corn, sweet and hot mint, chunky oak, and a warm, spicy-sweet finish. On the front edge of the bell curve for 4 to 6 year old bourbons; plenty of spunk. Not for someone who wants a mellow glass, this one's lively. Sourced whiskey. <i>

</i>",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
86,J.P. Wiser’s Rye,40.0,Canadian,23,"J.P. Wiser’s signature is on the label, but the whisky itself bears the toasted-oak hallmarks of Corby master blender Dr. Don Livermore. There’s a lot to enjoy in this creamy, lush whisky. An initial blast of sweet caramel lingers as sour rye and bitter citrus pith emerge. These soon grow into hot gingery fizz and burned toffee. Dark fruits turn to citrus notes and cherry licorice while sizzling ginger mellows into softly glowing white pepper.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
86,Hunter Laing Old Malt Cask 20 year old (distilled at Bladnoch),50.0,Single Malt Scotch,115,"One of the first releases from the recently formed Hunter Laing &amp; Co, established in Glasgow by Stewart Laing, is this 20 year

old expression of Bladnoch. It was distilled in November 1992 and matured in a refill sherry cask. Lemon cake, honey, and ginger nuts on the pleasing nose; fruity and spicy on the palate, with a savory flourish, and a honey and malt backdrop. Spicy caramel and mocha coffee in the finish. £75",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
86,Bowmore Tempest IV/Dorus Mor,,Single Malt Scotch,119,"Tempest to the world, Dorus Mor in the U.S., this has an intensely salty start that’s

like being slapped by a wave on Bowmore’s harbor wall. That marine note

continues: samphire, clams with a squeeze of lemon. Water brings out wet clay.

The palate is equally briny, but with a sprig of lavender, then soft fruits

wreathed in peat smoke. It’s tense and coiled, with real energy when neat, but

it’s best like that, so deal with the heat.",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
86,Adelphi Fascadale 12 year old Batch 5 (distilled at Highland Park),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,69,"The fifth batch of Adelphi’s Fascadale single malt comprises a marriage of two Spanish oak casks and three American oak casks of Highland Park. The outturn is 1,483 bottles. Icing sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate, apricots, plus mildly smoky malt on the nose. Full-bodied and fruity on the palate, with toffee, black pepper, and a hint of peat in the background. The medium-length finish is slowly drying. £45",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
86,Old Pulteney 30 year old (2013 Edition),,Single Malt Scotch,384,"Apart from the 40 year old expression launched in 2012, this is the oldest Old Pulteney on the market, and annual batches are

released with slightly varying strengths. Refill bourbon casks have been used in their maturation. Sweet and zesty on the deceptively youthful nose, with banoffee pie, eating apples, and quite sweet oak on the palate. Cereal notes and pleasing oak in the lengthy finish. £250",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
86,Talisker Port Ruighe,,Single Malt Scotch,69,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30

percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish. £45",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
86,Wemyss Malts Chocolate Honeycomb (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 2001,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,81,"Rich and malty and, though it’ll look like I’m just reading the label, there is

chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise, with a raspberry sitting

on top. Bold and rich, with a nutty underpinning. Water makes it very fresh and

a little more hay-like. The palate is sweet and liquorous, with nougat,

macadamia, and a chewy mid-palate where that chocolate dribbles and melts.

Neat, it is slightly bitter; less so with water. Very sound. £53",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
86,Kilkerran Work In Progress 5 Bourbon,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"The first Kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from Glengyle distillery appeared in 2009, and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. For now, we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. The bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ripe apples, and ultimately, slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. Spicy on the palate, with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. The medium-length finish is drying, with a wisp of smoke. £38<b> </b>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
86,Paul John Edited,46.0,Indian Whisky,,"Edited is the medium peated version of Paul John, and will be followed later in the year with a big peated one. This will do for now, though. The whisky is once more intense and fruity but this time it plays off against a more herbal green apple note, smoke from the hearth, and a touch of spice. There’s also cinnamon—which is fast becoming a house style. Encouraging stuff.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
86,Stalk & Barrel Cask 2,,Canadian,,"What a difference a cask can make. This first-fill bourbon barrel has more robust flavors but noticeably less color than its antecedent, Cask 1. Linseed oil, raw canvas, and freshly dug blue clay form a rich, earthy base for flourishes of clean spirit, dry straw, and Chinese plum sauce. Hot pepper and pulling dry wood yield to

cherry blossoms, maraschino, and sautéed mushrooms. A splash of water unveils milk chocolate, rye crisps, and creamy custard. C$100",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
86,Dewar’s Highlander Honey,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,24,"Insistent honey nose, with whisky underneath; the honey is very forward, but still floral and light, fresh. Flavor is pleasant: floral, faintly herbal, and more honey, but again, light and fresh, not cloying, not heavy. There’s a hint of citrus in the finish, and then, finally, there is a slightly sticky character. Not something a single malt drinker would likely reach for, but a respectable entry in the field of flavored whisky.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
86,Glenfiddich 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,37,"The world’s best-selling single malt. Isn’t that sufficient to give this dram some respect? It might be me, but it strikes me that ’Fiddich has more heft to it these days, with a sherried element giving the pear, apple, and light cereal of the distillery character a sweet, plump, sultana underpinning. This then adds chewiness to the palate, balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. Great balance.",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
86,Gordon & MacPhail Rare Old (distilled at Glenugie) 1970,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Elgin distiller, bottler, and whisky merchant Gordon & MacPhail has revamped its prestigious Rare Old range of veteran single malts, many from lost distilleries, and this bottling from Glenugie in Peterhead is one of the latest releases in the lineup. Sweet on the nose, with marshmallows, wax polish, creamy caramel, and milk chocolate. Quite full-bodied, with white pepper, ginger, muted citrus fruit, and cocoa. Soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish, with musty oak and aniseed. £430",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
86,Highland Park Harald,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Harald Fairhair was King of Norway and a major figure in Viking history. This Warrior variant takes us closer to Highland Park’s traditional DNA, with the nose offering potato peels on a barbecue; earthy and herbal, with developing notes of heather in bloom and even violets. Lively fresh fruits, newly-baked cake, nutmeg, and ginger figure on the palate. The spicy finish is relatively long, with candied citrus peel and licorice. €75/700 ml",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
86,Tullibardine 20 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 20 year old expression of Tullibardine has been aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, like its younger stablemate Sovereign. Caramel, honey, cocoa, and a hint of linseed oil on the nose. The palate is creamy, with strawberries, warm milk chocolate, and allspice. Long and soft in the finish, which is reminiscent of choc-ice. At 20, this single malt has gained in richness and sophistication, with an extremely enticing flavor profile.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
86,Bulleit Bourbon 10 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"The new, elder sibling to the standard Bulleit. It shows the Bulleit personality, but it’s deeper and drier on the nose and palate (as would be expected), with more oak, dried orchard fruit, and dark berried fruit, along with a hint of barrel char, leather, vanilla powder, and a dusting of cinnamon. I’d save this as a postprandial bourbon, and opt for the standard Bulleit as an aperitif. ",John Hansell,Summer 2013
86,Pike Creek,40.0,Canadian,,"This export-only Pike Creek reminds us of the year-to-year differences we can expect from whisky that spends Canada’s brutal winters (and sweltering summers) in unheated warehouses. Slightly younger than the Canada-only version, this is just different enough to be its own whisky. Gingery hot pepper laces its way through sweet, ripe red fruit as vague menthol with a slight herbal edge slips gently into silky oak tannins. Finishes cleanly with a citrus pithiness. ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
86,Spirit of Hven Seven Stars,45.0,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"This is the second release from this tiny independent Swedish distillery and it takes a confident step forward from the first, though it's not the finished article yet. The youthfulness is there but there's much to admire, too: citrus notes, mainly lemon, some melon, tropical fruit (mango, perhaps?), and some soft orange fruits make for a gentle, almost blend-like whisky. Late saltiness and a touch of pepper ensure it's not cloying, and distinctively Swedish. Very encouraging.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
86,Douglas Laing (distilled at Auchentoshan) 11 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,62,"This expression of Auchentoshan from Douglas Laing’s Provenance range was distilled in September 2000, matured in bourbon casks, and bottled in November 2012. Opens very sweet on the nose, with vanilla, peaches, and apricots, plus allspice. More caramel in time. Medium bodied, with sweet fruits, new-mown hay, and hard toffee on the palate, giving way to spice and aniseed. The spicy finish features cloves, and dries steadily, with a final flourish of pepper. £40",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
86,The Balvenie DoubleWood 17 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,130,"A limited edition bottling to commemorate the great David Stewart’s 50th year in the business and, as befits this quiet man, here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. This gives more of a nod to Cognac than Speyside; something to do with the dried apricot, orange blossom, and golden syrup. The palate is gentle and layered, with more dried fruits, which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where, finally, some cereal is glimpsed.",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
86,Lady of the Glen (distilled at Benrinnes) 14 year old 1998,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this, a classic Benrinnes. This is a distillery where meatiness is desirable, and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet, with an added herbal and pruney element. A real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance whiskies) add to the complexity. Chewy on the tongue, with earthiness revealed by water. £65  ",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
86,Glengoyne 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Glengoyne’s core range has been revamped: the 12 year old cask strength bottling was replaced by one with no age statement, and this 15 year old was added. Maturation has taken place in sherry casks and the result is a nose of vanilla, ginger, toffee, vintage cars’ leather seats, and sweet fruit notes. The somewhat oily palate features quite lively spices, raisins, hazelnuts, and oak. The finish is medium in length and spicy to the end, with cocoa powder. £48",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
86,Charbay R5 Clear,,Craft Whiskey,,"Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA has long been a beloved California craft beer. Charbay distiller Marko Karakasevic liked it so much he made whiskey from it. The Clear (aged 22 months in stainless tanks) sings with hoppy citrus zest and pine notes set in a sweet background. It’s nicely nuanced in the mouth, though, with a creamy body that sparkles with bitter orange and grapefruit floating over understated malt. Preferred over his Doubled & Twisted; this is more sophisticated. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
86,St. George's Founder's Private Cellar Triple Distilled Cask 0116,,Single Malt English Whisky,,"The Private Cellar range is a cask strength, single cask range where St. George's can have some fun and dip a toe into uncharted waters. Triple distillation makes the whisky smoother, sweeter, and more rounded…which shouldn't work with the earthy, rustic style of St. George’s. It does —big time. There are rum and raisin notes, and a creaminess that masks the sappy youthfulness of the whisky (it's 5 years old).   £148",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
86,Douglas Laing (distilled at Glen Mhor) 30 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This veteran Old Malt Cask offering was distilled in Glen Mhor, Inverness during 1982. The early nose is very fruity, with Jelly Babies, then icing sugar and almonds come through, accompanied by supple malt. A good mouthfeel, with the fruitiness following on from the nose, joined by spicy toffee, a wisp of wood smoke, and old oak. The finish is medium to long, slightly resinous, and citric with a dash of cocoa and a hint of peat.  £115",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
86,Jacob’s Ghost White Whiskey,40.0,White Whiskey,,"This was barrel-aged for a year, then “brightened” to white clarity; just the slightest hint of amber remains. But the aging has taken away the shouty greenness of new make; the nose is clean, a light blend of corn and woodsy vanilla. Sweet flavors bubble on the tongue: coconut, circus peanuts, peanut butter fudge, vanilla, jellybeans. The finish lingers in corn and rye. There’s more than meets the eye here, and it’s priced for impulsive experimentation.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
86,Grant’s 18 year old Rare,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,78,"The last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt Scotch whisky. Shackleton and Compass Box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of Johnnie Walker and Blue Hanger. So quality brands from the likes of Grant’s have to rethink. This is well made, tasty, balanced, complex, and drinkable without water or a mixer. But shouldn’t a premium whisky justify a strength of 46% ABV? I think so. £50",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
86,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Balblair 1991 Crozes-Hermitage Finish,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled in October 1991, this 20 year old Private Collection expression of Balblair spent 40 months of secondary maturation in casks sourced from Crozes-Hermitage, the largest AOC in the northern Rhône wine-producing region of France. The nose offers red currants, sultanas, vanilla, and white pepper. The palate is initially soft and sweet, with summer fruits, but gradually darkens and dries. The finish features dark chocolate and raisins. 2,000 bottles. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
86,Caol Ila 14 year old Special Release 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is Caol Ila not only in unpeated guise, but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. Full and lush, the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits, mashed banana, and Mars bar. With water, it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. The mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. Who needs peat? My best value bottling this issue.  ",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
86,Dalwhinnie 25 year old Special Release 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,,"There have been three previous Special Release offerings of Dalwhinnie, and this 1987 distillation is the first to have been aged in rejuvenated American oak hogsheads. Cloves are to the fore on the aromatic nose, along with cinnamon, ginger, fudge, and tropical fruits. Initially oily and honeyed on the palate, with developing spice, wood resin, and herbal flavors. Spicy oak in the lengthy finish, with a return to the initial note of cloves. 5,358 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
86,Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Royal Brackla) 12 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The Old Malt Cask ‘Royal Jubilee Commemorative Bottle’ appropriately comes from one of two surviving Scottish distilleries with a ‘royal’ prefix, namely Brackla, located in the Northern Highland region, near Nairn. Maturation has taken place in a refill sherry cask. The nose is like a damp, empty house, with herbal notes, pencil shavings, oranges, and pine needles. Full-bodied and spicy, with freshly-sawn timber, pine, and brittle toffee on the palate. Citric, with camphor and pepper in the finish. 250 bottles. £50",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
86,High West American Prairie Reserve (Batch 1),46.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"A blend of two different bourbons—one 6 years old, the other 10 years old—with different mashbills. Nicely balanced sweet notes (caramel, butterscotch), fruit (orange, sultana, cherry) and gentle spice (vanilla, cinnamon). Nothing fancy or exotic here; just a solid, versatile, well-rounded bourbon. (Available at the High West General Store.)",John Hansell,Winter 2012
86,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Auchentoshan) ‘Lemon Sorbet’ 1998,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This expression of the triple-distilled Lowland single malt is a 14 year old single cask bottling, and just 314 bottles are available. Fresh pineapple and vanilla toffee on the fragrant, soft nose. The palate is lively and fruity, with lemon zest, caramel, a hint of black pepper, and then deeper fruit notes of ripe peach. The finish is quite lengthy, with lingering fruit flavors. £55",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
86,Wemyss Lord Elcho 15 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"It's not often that the blended whisky section can be described as 'the group of death' but at most other times this whisky would shine. It's a very good whisky, rich in flavor and punching above its 40% ABV, mixing creamy vanilla, pureed peach and apricot, key lime pie, chocolate, and manuka honey to great effect. It's soft and rounded, with little obvious oak, and the finish is feather-light, with a slightly fruit sponge finale. £50",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
86,Sullivans Cove Cask HHD430,,Australian Whisky,,"Sullivans Cove whisky is matured in French oak and bottled as single cask offerings, and there is a big variation in taste. As a rule of thumb, though, anything with a number higher than 330 is worth checking out. This is a standout, moving away from the Speyside-style fruitiness of some casks toward treacle, chicory coffee, and burnt hazelnut on the nose. The taste has apricot, sweet orange, honey, cinnamon, and menthol, and the finish is soft and light. A$95",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
86,Yamazaki Bourbon Barrel,48.0,Japanese,112,"Very bright gold. This shows some of the warm tatami/dry grass notes seen in Yamazaki 12 year old, this time overlaid with fruit stones, banana chips, fresh persimmon, and, once it opens, cask-generated aromas of crème brûlée, cinnamon toast, caramelized sugar, and cotton candy. The palate is sweet and lush with plenty of vanilla ice cream, but there’s sufficient acidity to maintain freshness and prevent things from getting too flabby. £70",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
86,The Dalmore 1992 aged 19 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The most youthful bottling in the Constellation series is a 19 year old, which started life in a first-fill bourbon barrel before being transferred into a European oak port pipe in 2002 for a further nine years of maturation. The nose offers a hint of new leather, marzipan, developing caramel, and damsons. Zesty fruit, allspice, and ground ginger on the palate, along with thick-cut orange marmalade. The finish is long, warming, and spicy. Cask number 18; 737 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
86,"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1991 (Release 3, Cask #7023)",,Single Malt Scotch,,"This time we’ve got Macallan in savory mode, even a little balsamic. The spirit shows its hand more than in the 1995, with typical Macallan heft. Now you are deep in a forest of yew and larch with a dark chocolate bar for sustenance. Maturity has brought out leather alongside clove and resin. The palate shows a similar tomato note seen in the 1995 cask, with positive bitterness and wedding cake. Though grippy, it has great balance. 285 bottles.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
86,Talisker 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Previously only available as part of Diageo’s annual Special Releases program, and now bottled at the classic Talisker strength of 45.8%, instead of cask strength. Initially salty, then sweet and spicy on the nose, with summer berries, heather honey, and an earthy note, plus subtle peat. Spicy and drying on the slightly waxy palate, with licorice, aniseed, and prominent peat embers. The finish is medium in length, peppery, and relatively tannic. £225 ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
86,Tomatin 15 year old,52.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The latest release from Tomatin distillery is a limited edition (3,150 bottles) 15 year old that has been matured in a combination of second-fill bourbon barrels and tempranillo wine casks (the grape of full-bodied Spanish reds like those from Rioja). The nose offers fruit cocktail and salted popcorn, while milk chocolate, vanilla, and nutty caramel notes emerge. Soft chocolate, bananas, and autumn berries on the slightly peppery palate. The finish is nutty, with lingering spice, peppery oak, and finally a lengthy, creamy sensation.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
86,Breaking & Entering,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Sourced from several undisclosed Kentucky bourbon distillers. Well-rounded and nicely balanced, with prominent spice (cinnamon, clove, evergreen, powdered vanilla), soft fruit (mandarin, coconut, apricot, hint of pineapple), and toasted nuts, all on a bed of caramel. Very versatile: mature enough for pleasurable sipping (but just), and youthful enough to add zing to a cocktail. ",John Hansell,Fall 2012
86,Auchentoshan Heartwood,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,63,"Auchentoshan has launched a range of travel retail-exclusive bottlings with names relating to oak, including Heartwood, which is matured in a mix of deeply-charred former bourbon and toasted oloroso sherry casks. Soft, medium sherry notes on the nose; stem ginger, cinnamon, parma violets, and clove-studded oranges. The palate features wood polish, old leather, plain chocolate, cloves, and ginger. Dates and spicy orange marmalade on the lengthy finish. €50",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
86,Chieftain’s (distilled at Bruichladdich) 22 year old 1989,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A distinctive (and intriguing) Bruichladdich, with honeyed malt, vanilla pod, charcoal, exotic fruit, and dark chocolate bourbon balls, teased with suggestions of fennel and espresso bean. Tactile, leather finish. (A D&amp;M Wines &amp; Liquors exclusive.)",John Hansell,Summer 2012
86,Clynelish Distillers Edition 1993,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"When this first appeared I found it too sweet, which was strange, as the finishing period is in dry oloroso casks. This most recent iteration sees the finish better integrated. There’s more spiciness than on the standard 14 year old, while the fruit seems plumper: more apricot and kumquat. The waxiness is there but the candle is scented. It still clings to the tongue, but there is an added nutty, oxidized character. A marked improvement.£47",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
86,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Clynelish) 1990,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Duncan Taylor’s latest cask strength, single cask release from the Sutherland distillery of Clynelish is 21 years old. It is sweet on the nose, with hand-rolling tobacco, milk chocolate, overripe grapes, and vanilla. Becoming saltier and drier. Nutty and mildly maritime on the palate, with lots of spice, steadily drying. Spice and ginger in the lengthy, oily finish. £80",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
86,Dalwhinnie 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Along with Cragganmore, this is one of the underrated members of the original Classic Six. Quite why has always slightly baffled me. OK, it isn’t smoky, but the nose has a deep, soft, honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits, hints of thick cream, and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. Thick in the center and very gentle, it’s that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
86,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1964 (Cask #4719),,Single Malt Scotch,803,"A sherry butt this time, which has allowed the whisky a little more space to breathe. Although as concentrated as you&#039;d expect here, we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think Margaret Dumont. I pick up some rose hip syrup, dried apple, Armagnac/prune, and a licorice note, as seen on the ’62; while on the palate, a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. Big but balanced. £512",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
86,Talisker Distillers Edition 2000,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The immediate shore-like blast suggests that the sweet amoroso casks haven’t been overly enthusiastic in their embrace. What seems to have happened is that while giving some date and prune they have added an extra layer of oak — giving a charred element — and, like Lagavulin, hints of tar. The smoke is obscured and the pepper is Javanese. It’s a polite Talisker, but the absorption of the smoke means it has lost something integral to its being. ",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
86,Corsair Ryemageddon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,,"A hot and spicy nose: dry rye, sweet mint, and alcohol heat. Hot on the tongue too, with the mint flashing across an oily graininess. The finish is where it finally cools down, laying down thin layers of sweet mint and light chocolate on the palate. Water tames the heat and brings out more chocolate, but steals that nice finish. Not overly approachable, but…it’s rye.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
86,Ranger Creek .36,48.0,Craft Whiskey,,"That’s “.36” as in ’36 caliber,’ the first of this Texas distiller’s Small Caliber Series of Texas bourbon whiskeys. Sharpish on the nose with some hot alcohol, cinnamon, and oak, warmed by burnt sugar and vanilla. A kick of hot oak spice on the tongue, a flush of hot, dry corn, and flashes of mint and vanilla, then a long, spicy finish with more dry mint. One of the better young bourbons — only 8 months — I’ve had. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
86,Southern Coast Malt Cask 5,46.0,Australian Whisky,,"I'm not sure that if you loved Cask 4 you'd be so pleased with Cask 5, because it's completely different. This has the shadow of Bill Lark all over it, with big, over-cooked red apple flavors combining with walnut oil, orange liqueur, treacle toffee, stewed berries, and some oaky astringency. It's rich, full, complex, and a grower — and I can feel a new love affair starting right here. A$110",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
86,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Aberlour) Dimensions Range 1993 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"A light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and whisky, but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. Aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. There are candies, bubblegum, kiwi fruits, and cut flowers. The palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. Altogether a little charmer.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
86,Arran 14 Year Old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This expression from the Isle of Arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component whiskies were matured in European oak casks while two-thirds came from American oak. Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose, with peaches, brandy, and ginger snaps, plus vanilla and mild oak. Smooth and creamy on the palate, with spicy summer fruits, apricots, and hazelnuts. The lingering finish is spicy, biscuity, and slowly drying, with just a hint of salt.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
86,Glenglassaugh Aged 37 Years,56.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Glenglassaugh distillery has released a number of country-exclusive expressions recently, including this 37 year old single cask (470 bottles) for North America, under the Master Distillers Selection banner. Initially, cornflakes and sherry on the nose, with developing vanilla and soft toffee. Becoming very sweet. Rich and notably spicy on the palate, with dates and dark chocolate. Persistently spicy in the finish, with background citrus fruits.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
86,Glenrothes 1979 Editor’s Cask #3828,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Last year, four whisky editors were invited by Glenrothes’ heritage director Ronnie Cox to choose a single cask bottling. Being opinionated hacks, they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! This, the oldest, from a refill butt, is for the European markets, and shows hints of rancio: truffle, leaf mold, boot polish, and star anise. The impression is of faded elegance with tannins, fruit, and spice in harmony, and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
86,Old Pulteney Row to the Pole,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Explorer Jock Wishart’s successful ‘Row to the Pole’ expedition is celebrated with this 3,000 bottle commemorative edition matured in ex-American and ex-Spanish oak sherry casks selected by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. New-mown grass, ripe apples, brine, and a whiff of  Arbroath smokies on the nose. Citrus fruit, spices, and milk chocolate on the palate, with sherry lending gravitas. The finish is sweet, full, and lengthy, with brine returning at the last. £20 (350 ml)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
86,Hakushu 12 year old,,Japanese,,"Although only two years older, this expression of Hakushu — the first to be launched in the U.S. — shows a fleshier side to the distillery’s wares. While it has retained the freshness of the 10 year old, it shows more pineapple and grapefruit on the nose, with a little fragrance of jasmine and osmanthus. On the palate, it’s fresh and lively with a hint of persimmon and a tickle of smoke. Recommended.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
86,Glengoyne Distiller’s Gold 15 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distiller’s Gold is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and is dedicated to the distillery’s first manager, Cochran Cartwright, whose ghost is said to haunt the Stirlingshire distillery. Distiller’s Gold displays a nose of brittle nut toffee and dried fruit, with vanilla and caramel notes emerging. Spicy tropical fruits on the palate, with an edge of cinnamon and ginger. Medium in length, pleasantly oaky, persistently nutty and spicy. Price is per liter.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
86,Tullibardine Vintage 1993,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The latest Tullibardine vintage release to hit the States is another example of whisky distilled in 1993, but now bottled at 18 years of age. The initial nose features cut grass and sliced melon, with freshly-peeled tree bark. Intensifying sweetness with time. Quite rich and full on the palate, with cereal, soft fudge, and mild ginger. The finish is medium in length, insistently spicy, with oak and vanilla notes. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
86,Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Balmenach) 2000 9 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Young it certainly is. Precocious even, and a pallid-looking youth on first impression, but behind that bland exterior is freshness and life with a fragrance that is very un-Balmenach, all chilled Muscat grapes, melon, even some cucumber. This general perfumed zinginess continues on the tongue, though the weight of the distillate (Balmenach has worm tubs) anchors it well. It’s not about age — it’s about character. Enjoy. ",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
86,Adelphi (distilled at Dailuaine) 1983 27 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The dark color shouts “sherried!” and the nose confirms. After an initial blast of marzipan there’s rosin, stewed Assam tea, some licorice, hard treacle toffee, truffle, and a charred element, all backed with an earthy undertow. The palate is tight and quite hot, with charred red pepper and a bosky, wooded note. Not a great fan of water — this is about that deep, fungal stuff — there’s an uplift of sweet dark fruits at the end, offering balance. £105",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
86,Springbank 14 year old Manzanilla Cask (#259),,Single Malt Scotch,,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 



Complex citrus (orange, tangerine, lime, and a hint of lemon), honeyed malt kissed by maple syrup, caramelized pineapple, cinnamon, and a dusting of nutmeg. Nutty toffee on the finish. ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
86,Springbank 14 year old Oloroso Cask (#268),,Single Malt Scotch,,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market.

While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 



What you might expect a traditional 100% oloroso sherry cask-aged Springbank to taste like, with probably the most familiar flavor profile of the four: rich, with nuts and dried fruit, chocolate-coated brittle toffee, plenty of spice (cinnamon, ginger), polished oak, hint of tobacco and smoke. ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
86,Wemyss Malts Vanilla Summer Single Cask,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes Vanilla Summer. It is an unspecified Highland single malt, distilled in 1997, and the bourbon cask in which it was matured has yielded 263 bottles. Vanilla, buttercups, and violets on the nose, developing Bramley apples with peaches and cream. Background of mildly spicy malt. Sweet and floral on the palate, with tropical fruits, fudge, and ginger. Slowly drying with benevolent oak, but ultimately a lingering creaminess. £50 (Not available in the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
86,Balblair,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This cask strength Northern Highlander offers a full and complex nose, comprising brandy notes, stewed apricots, spices, table salt, and white pepper. A hint of nougat turns to darker caramel. Rich on the palate, mouth-coating, sweet, with lively spices. The finish is buttery, with a pinch of ginger, and a final brandy-and-soda finish. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
86,"Bladnoch 1993, Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice range",43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This most recent Connoisseurs’ Choice bottling from Scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. The nose is pleasing and light, mildly herbal, with cut grass, citrus fruits, and a hint of malt. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity in the mouth, with peaches, nuts, and discreet spice. Relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. Very drinkable and quite substantial.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
86,The Dalmore Dee Dram,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,69,"With the percentage of former oloroso sherry-matured spirit ramped up to 60 percent in this Dee variant, the nose is deeper and richer than that of the Tweed Dram; Seville orange marmalade and a hint of cocoa. More immediate dark chocolate on the palate, with raisins and walnuts. The finish is lengthy, with plums, black coffee, and a suggestion of licorice. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
86,The Dalmore Tweed Dram,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,69,"Comprising 80 percent American white oak-matured whisky and 20 percent from ex-oloroso sherry casks, the Tweed Dram offers lots of citrus fruit on the nose, with an early dusting of icing sugar, then orange and lemon wine gums. Relatively light and fresh, with gentle fudge notes. Malt, toffee, cinnamon, and over-ripe oranges on the spicy palate. Quite long in the finish, with spicy oak, nutmeg, and lingering dark chocolate notes. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
86,Glen Garioch,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Melon notes to the fore early on the nose; floral, especially carnations. Progressively more caramel, with Parma violet sweets. Pretty and feminine. Richer and fuller-bodied on the palate than the nose might suggest. Fresh fruit, apple juice, almonds, and gentle spices, slowly moving to milky coffee in the finish. The faintest hint of smoke pervades the flavor, but is very much a ‘bit part’ player in the ensemble. ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
86,Glenrothes 1995,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This hails from the first of Rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. The nose shows typical Rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. As it opens. there’s wet linen, caramel fudge, and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. A touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. The finish is gentle, lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur. ",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
86,"Glenugie, Chivas Brothers, Deoch an Doras bottling",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Recently added to Chivas Brothers’ lineup of Cask Strength Edition whiskies, this Eastern Highland single malt from the ‘lost’ distillery of Glenugie in the fishing port of Peterhead is perfumed on the nose, with discreet sherry, cocoa, fresh leather, blackcurrants, peaches, and apricots. The palate is initially sweet, with fresh fruit, but old-fashioned cough drops and black coffee notes soon arrive. Very long in the spicy, tannic oak finish. Exclusive to Chivas Brothers’ distillery visitor centers and www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com (500 bottles). £250 ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
86,Edradour Ballechin #5,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The fifth peated release of Edradour. This one is aged in Marsala casks. Sweet, with clinging fruit and thumping raw smoke. Youthful, embracing, and fleshy in the middle, with ash, anise, and espresso that grow toward the finish. These Ballechin releases keep getting better. Reminds me of a young Islay whisky without the brine and seaweed. ",John Hansell,Spring 2011
86,Glenglassaugh,,Single Malt Scotch,,"An intriguing whisky. Blueberry cobbler, crushed grape, maple syrup, nougat, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg). The oak is polished and unimposing. Liqueur-ish. A nice contrast to its younger sibling, and it’s more polarizing because of its distinctiveness. ",John Hansell,Spring 2011
86,Kilkerran,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Visit Springbank’s tasting room and you’ll find distillery-only bottlings of all three whisky styles produced by the Campbeltown distillery. But it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. On the palate there’s plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice. ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
87,Compass Box Affinity,46.0,Miscellaneous,150,"Egon Spengler warned ‘Don’t cross the streams,’ and it feels as though the calvados dominates the flavors of Scotch whisky in this rich, sweet mash-up. After a nose of vanilla essence and oxidized apple notes, the palate brings baked apple, brown sugar, caramel syrup, and clove, with lighter vanilla notes rebounding off the sticky apple flavors. Long warming finish, with more calvados sweetness and pounding spices. (6,028 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
87,Jefferson’s Reserve Pritchard Hill Cabernet Cask-Finished,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Cherry bubble gum, white grape juice, hazelnuts, brown sugar, and rye bread on the nose. The palate is bright and gently spiced, with a soft, creamy texture and restrained grape, black tea, nut, and chocolate flavors. Coffee beans, nutty chocolate, and persistent oak on the finish. Surprisingly austere for a wine cask-finished bourbon, but to good effect.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Ardmore Legacy,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"A mix of 80% peated and 20% unpeated malt. Charcuterie, cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel on the nose.

87,Balvenie 12 year old The Sweet Toast of American Oak,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Matured primarily in bourbon barrels for 12 years before a 3-month finish in slow-toasted virgin American oak barrels from Kelvin Cooperage in Kentucky.

Raisins and black tea in the medium-length finish. (30,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,Macallan 12 year old Sherry Oak,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This is the youngest Sherry Oak expression available. A classic Macallan nose of sherry, baking Christmas cake, dried fruits, hot butter, and old leather. Jaffa oranges, brittle toffee, and light oak on the smooth, full palate. Relatively long in the finish, with spice, malt, oak, and a final hint of smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,New Holland Beer Barrel-Finished Bourbon,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Aromatic and expressive on the nose, with grapefruit, lemon, and orange peels, kiwi, green apple Hi-Chew, melon, and a hint of pine and dried leaves. The palate is light-bodied and clean, with citrus peel, melon, soft spice, sarsaparilla, and milk chocolate. It finishes short and gentle, but tasty, with candied rose petal, dried kiwi, and grape Fun Dip. While many beer-barrel finishes come on too strong, this one succeeds with subtlety.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Like opening a lunchbox in elementary school: you’ll find the distinct aromas of peanut butter sandwich with strawberry jam and a smear of Marshmallow Fluff, plus a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie, and some apple blossom and tea rose. Soft and sweet in the mouth, with plenty of fruit and flowers: banana split topped with crushed pistachios, rose oil, white chocolate, halva. This whiskey is finished in charred maple barrels and undergoes a second filtration with the Lincoln County Process.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1968 (distilled at Caol Ila),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Coal smoke, brine, machine oil, and herbal notes on the nose of this 50 year old, along with a hint of menthol and ultimately, floral notes. Dark berries on the palate, bitter orange, plus sea salt. The finish is long and slightly smoky, overtly oaky, with black pepper notes. (50 bottles in U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,Seven Stills Patience Single Pot Still-Style,,American Whiskey (Unspecified),75,"Waxy and fragrant, with citrus oil, tea bag, furniture polish, dried flowers, cooked apple, and malt. At this proof, the palate demands water, which tames its heat to reveal candied rose petal, dried ginger, apple, almond, pistachio, lemon pepper, pine resin, and some ashiness. It finishes waxy, with charred pecans, cigar end, bitter oak, and black pepper. There are some unusual juxtapositions here, but they work. (302 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,James E. Pepper 1776 Straight 100 Proof,50.0,Rye Whiskey,30,"Classic rye notes of orange and pepper spice along with vanilla custard. A full mouthfeel presages a palate of lemon meringue pie, whipped cream, caramel, baking spice, and herbaceous notes of pine and dill, but also tropical flavors, melon, and peach. A lengthy finish that’s full and rich, offering chocolate and reprising the tropical notes of pineapple and orange on the back note. Quite powerful, solid, and reliable.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
87,Ragtime Bottled in Bond Straight,50.0,Rye Whiskey,49,"New York Distilling Co.’s first bonded whiskey, which also conforms to the voluntary Empire Rye standards. It’s herbaceous and grain-driven on the nose, with licorice, dried mint, brown sugar, peanut oil, and buttered pecans. The dry palate is remarkably light, with flavors of black pepper, walnuts, licorice, mint, orange, and tart cherries. Oak, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Wilderness Trail Small Batch Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch D02),50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,48,"Despite some obvious youth, the aromas here are enjoyable, as Honey Nut Cheerios and bake shop sticky buns and cinnamon rolls hearken to the primary grain flavors. Fruity banana, Raisinets, and lots of fresh oak are apparent. Marmalade and citrus oil flavors are tasty, but the gingerbread heat and raw oak suggest it would benefit from additional maturation.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
87,Mayor Pingree Red Label Straight (Batch No. 001),47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,48,"Herbal, citrus, and subtle oak aromas mingle with grape soda, ground ginger, iced tea, and cinnamon Teddy Grahams on the nose. Medium-bodied and well-spiced, it’s a little hot, but softens with water and develops nicely in the glass, showing flavors of chocolate, nuts, grape jelly, and blueberry compote. The finish is sweet with cooked berries, chocolate, oak, and subtle spice. Made by Valentine Distilling Co. in Ferndale, Michigan.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Scottish Leader Blended Malt,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,37,"Another classic label introduces its blended malt alter ego: this is much fruitier than Scottish Leader on first impression, with apple, pear, lime zest, apricot tart, sherry notes, and a trace of spice. Apple pie filling with clove and ginger spices, plus vanilla, dark toffee, hard candies, citrus, and nougat peak early, then ride the crest of a wave until a gingersnap and spice finish. <em>(Travel Retail)</em> £30",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
87,Strathcolm 12 year old,40.0,Single Grain Scotch,41,"The oldest in the Strathcolm trio of whiskies, this has greater depth and richness on the nose, with caramel, ground hazelnut, whole-wheat bagels, honey, and fragrant roasted spices.

87,Founding Spirits American Whiskey (Batch 10),50.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),45,"Distilled from corn, oats, wheat, and barley at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits. The nose has clean, sweet applewood smoke, raw peanuts, oolong tea, grain, and treacle. On the palate there’s strong oak, but it’s well-tempered by spice, smoke, savory nuts, grilled apples, and chalky saline minerality. The finish is savory and nutty—appetite-inducing—and overall, it takes water well.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Bladnoch 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Ripe peaches, vanilla, sweet oak, and milky coffee on the nose. The palate is luscious and smooth, with sweet orange notes and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length, with spicy berry fruits, oak, and lingering ginger.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
87,Glengoyne The Legacy Series Chapter One,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Dates, brittle toffee, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose, then a hint of ripe peaches surfaces. Smooth in the mouth, with sherry, damsons, more dried fruits, and background pipe tobacco smoke. Prune juice in the finish, which is drying, and ultimately quite oaky, with white pepper.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
87,Glenkinchie 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Floral on the nose and quite delicate, with citrus fruit, spicy vanilla, walnuts, and cereal.

87,Bushmills The Steamship Collection Rum Cask Reserve,40.0,Irish Single Malt,130,"Jaffa orange, flowers, hard candies, rose water, and light spices make a rather muted offering. Fortunately there’s a sweet, malty mouthful of fudge, orange shred, gingerbread, and candied orange slices, with a nibble of peppercorn spices and a finish of clove-studded orange. Tasty and well-balanced, salvaging the less than inspiring nose. (Travel Retail)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Chicken Cock Heritage Reserve,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,38,"A light and sweet bourbon, with butterscotch candy, toasted coconut, lemon curd, marshmallow, and a bit of chalkiness on the nose.

It finishes with hookah tobacco, toasted oak, and almonds.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Chicken Cock Bootlegger’s Reserve,45.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"This blend of bourbon and rye offers quince, kiwi, jasmine, honey, vanilla, angel food cake, sultanas, and lemon meringue on the nose. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward, but offers coconut, banana flan, maple syrup, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and lemon, with an appealing char note. The finish is gently spicy, smooth, and light, ending with sweet vanilla and soft oak. Perhaps a bit closed at times, and lacks some cohesiveness, but it’s very easy to enjoy.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,West Cork Barrel Proof (2018 Release),62.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,55,"Uh-oh, here comes trouble. Sourdough, lemon, toffee, creamy vanilla, banana bread, and a few floral notes compete with the intimidating high alcohol. It begins with orange-shred marmalade, fleeting nutty-chocolate notes, and lots of peppery spice before a substantial onslaught of alcohol tramples the taste buds. Sure, it can be tamed with water, but is that really the point? Provocative, hedonistic, raw, and reckless; I’m very glad it’s around. (5,300 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Dublin Liberties Murder Lane 13 year old,46.0,Irish Single Malt,179,"Darryl McNally’s killer new whiskey was finished in Tokaj casks and launched to coincide with the opening of their new distillery. Inhaling the volatiles evokes scents of lime, sugar-sprinkled puff pastry, sweet and sour plum, toasted oak, and Chinese five spice. The waxy mouthfeel, with cooked fruit, sweet vanilla, marzipan, orange, and plum, is silenced when the trigger is pulled on the pepper, allspice, and clove ending. Well-executed. €160",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Tincup American Whiskey,42.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),30,"A blend of high-rye bourbon from Indiana and a small amount of Colorado single malt. Black tea, cooked stone fruits, blackberry jam, white pepper, and cinnamon toast on the nose. The palate is sweet and light, with hot cocoa mix, toasted oak, cola, iced tea, orange, and clove that crescendos in a flash of heat and then subsides. Dried blueberries, dark chocolate, and integrated oak on the finish. Water not recommended. <em>Best Value</em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Davidson Reserve Four Grain Tennessee Straight (Batch 2018-002),50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Unbaked pastry dough, swirled with brown sugar and chopped almonds, meets orange blossom water, cream soda, coconut flakes, and pistachio pudding. There’s more pastry, toasted coconut and almonds, cinnamon, brown sugar, and orange on the palate, along with plenty of oak. A splash of water goes a long way to emphasize the prettier flavors while playing down some of the youthful heat.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Ballyhoo,43.0,Irish,30,"Connacht Whiskey Co. finished 4 year old grain whiskey in port barrels for 3 to 6 months in this new and improved recipe. Cherry soda, rose hip, lemon zest, vanilla frosting, and dry grass aromas with a taste of damson, cherry, redcurrant jelly, pepper, and a good lift of sugary sweetness.

87,Driftless Glen Rye,48.0,Rye Whiskey,50,"Classical fruity rye notes of orange, green apple, and blueberry on the nose, along with fresh-baked muffin and a whiff of new oak. The palate is somewhat arch at first, but it quickly melts into honey, warm chocolate sauce, caramel, cinnamon, baking spice, orange candy, walnut, and a hint of pipe tobacco. The finish is light and well-balanced, with more orange, along with chocolate malt, caramel, iced tea, and black pepper.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,Hotel Tango Whiskey,45.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),50,"An American whiskey from Indianapolis-based Hotel Tango. The nose has notes of slate, herbs, tea, lemon peel, bitter orange, and vanilla wafer. The palate is somewhat green, with raisin, cinnamon candy, vanillin, grenadine, bitter chocolate, pecan, and cracked pepper. The finish is long and flavorful, offering orange, cherry, vanilla ice cream, mocha, and licorice. Perhaps too much wood influence, but water balances it well, creating a smooth, complex, and enjoyable whiskey.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,Treaty Oak Ghost Hill Texas,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Fruity and fresh, there are aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, honeydew, underripe bananas, and floral notes—a garden in bloom. The palate retains freshness with herbaceous flavors of parsley and cucumber, as well as melon, licorice, white pepper, and a pop of cumin. Oak, pepper, licorice, and bouquet garni on the finish. Unconventional but enjoyable flavors, driven by the still.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Treaty Oak Red Handed,,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Fresh oak on the nose, floral notes, baked apple, bananas, and chocolate malt. The palate is light and slightly green, with herbal parsley notes, lime, and lemon, then expanding to vanilla, bitter chocolate, peanut shells, pepper, and tobacco.

87,Cream of Kentucky 11 year old Straight,51.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"The dried fruit, almost like Fruit Roll-Ups, quickly veers toward circus peanuts candy, taffy, and bubble gum, with notes of herbs— especially dill. The palate remains a bit of a fruit bomb, with banana, peach puree, dried papaya, and other tropical fruits, then clove and allspice add some complexity. A flavorful, if slightly peculiar bourbon dominated by tutti-frutti flavors and dill.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2019
87,Crooked Water Kings Point Port Wine Barrel Finished,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The nose is loaded with jasmine, orange blossoms, fresh peaches, gummy bears, red wine, grape fruit leather, and lashings of vanilla. In the mouth, it’s a mixed berry bonanza—raspberry, blueberry, and strawberry—with cherry, Red Vines, chocolate, and a hint of tobacco leaf. Though light, with a somewhat short finish, it’s well-balanced and tasty.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Crooked Water Old Hell Roaring Double Barreled Straight,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"This undergoes secondary maturation in heavily toasted and smoked new charred oak barrels, but you wouldn’t know it from the delicate nose, redolent with white flowers, Asian pear, cardamom, toasted almonds, and milk chocolate; the only hint is a bit of burnt sugar and dry leaves. On the palate, those special barrels reveal themselves with flavors of cedar, black pepper, chipotle, and barbecue potato chips, as well as apple, pecan, and milk chocolate. The finish has chili-chocolate and long, polished oak.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Devils River Texas Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,30,"Orange rind, pineapple, and tropical aromas on the nose. The palate has notes of chocolate milkshake, with nuttiness and a hint of espresso. Water brings out more tropical flavors, bitter chocolate, and a light char note. A bit hot, but the finish is balanced and reasonably long—chocolaty, lemony, with more of the charred note and some tobacco leaf. Not quite as full-bodied as it might be, but a solid rye expression nonetheless.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,Rebellion Rye,43.0,Rye Whiskey,36,"Give the nose time to open up, and it reveals herbal and earthy aromas, with fennel, dill, root beer, and evergreen forest, as well as sprinklings of cinnamon and cloves. The palate is chewy and vivacious, although the proof keeps the heat in check; flavors of chocolate, clove, allspice, orange oil, and nutty oak are ultimately enfolded in cigar wrapper, black pepper, and orange Creamsicle.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Eight & Sand Blended Bourbon,44.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"A blend of straight bourbons and American whiskeys, all aged at least 4 years, this is fruit cocktail in a glass: cherries, blackberries, wild strawberries, and sweet orange, along with allspice, clove, nutmeg, and a hint of cedar.

87,MacNair’s Lum Reek Peated,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,50,"Rich fruit, spiced orange, fudge, fragrant spices, and sweet, playful smoke make for a splendid nosing experience. The piscine flavors, however, may best suit smokeheads, as, along with fudge and vanilla, this has a splendid flavor of oily, smoky kippers. Golden syrup, green apple, and black pepper emerge, but the smoked-fish flavors spill into the finish to swim with pepper and fruity sweetness.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Oat Grain Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"The oak juts out a bit in this otherwise fresh and pleasant bourbon, where toasted oak meets cake batter, Honey Nut Cheerios, and porridge with pecans. It’s lacking much in the way of a ‘wow factor,’ but following the slightly tart fruit palate is a redeeming finish, balancing tasty apricot and bright citrus peel with drying oak tannins.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
87,Glenmorangie Original,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Original is eager to please, yet not lacking complexity. A soft nose features honey, vanilla, sweet orange, and caramel.

The overall effect of sticky sweetness lingers through the finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
87,Oban Bay Reserve,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,63,"An appropriately dark bottle and label are featured for the Night’s Watch bottling. Tangy citrus fruit, brittle toffee, and vanilla on the nose.

87,McKenzie Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,43,"Pineapple rings, lemon and orange wedges, and brown sugar aromas offset fresh pine and a bundle of herbs: basil, tarragon, fennel. The chewy palate is herbal and savory, with licorice, dark chocolate, roasted cherry, and plenty of oak, yielding to pineapple, orange, and lemon on the finish. The bump-up in proof from its non-bonded sibling bourbon yields nice results when adding water, which softens and expands the flavors.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019

87,Filibuster Straight Rye Dual Cask Finished,45.0,Rye Whiskey,41,"The nose begins with an aroma of orange peel, followed by a lively parade of black pepper, rye spice, cardamom, and tilled earth, then sweeter back notes of molasses and cinnamon stick. There’s pleasant heat and spice on the palate, starting with black pepper and then chocolate, powdered-sugar French toast, orange, treacle, cooked apple, and allspice.

87,Cotswolds Founder’s Choice,,Single Malt English Whisky,86,"Dedicated to Dr. Jim Swan, who encouraged Cotswolds Distillery to shave, toast, and re-char red wine barriques, this has developed aromas of cherry, dried goji berries, rose petal, vanilla cake mix, butterscotch, and muted spices. It still feels young at this mighty strength. Warm red fruits of cherry and strawberry slam into a distortion of allspice, clove, and tongue-searing alcohols, which are quelled eventually by sweet notes of creamy toffee and mint. (3,000 bottles) £65",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
87,Minor Case Sherry Cask Finished Rye,,Rye Whiskey,50,"The sherry cask finish asserts itself right up front, with orange oil, sweet figs, cloves, and cedar; aromas of grape candy, peonies, spearmint, and allspice appear as well. While this is unabashedly a rye, with flavors of cinnamon, black pepper, and oak, the sherry comes to the fore again in the guise of grape soda, sweet cherries, and chocolate. The finish is sweet and oak-driven, with good length.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019

Rich, malty, and flavorful—some enjoyable sipping here.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
87,Sons of Erin 15 year old,46.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,110,"Bourbon barrel matured, then finished in apple brandy casks as a limited edition, this is more malty than their regular bottlings, with aromas of melon, lemon, vanilla, sour gooseberry, and faint banana custard. It’s thicker texture rewards with sweet fudge, vanilla, ripe banana, hints of pecan, and spice, though it’s bedded down within the dessert flavors. A lengthy finish of lemon curd.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
87,Monkey Shoulder,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,33,"Never more than an arm’s length away from most bartenders, this blended malt, launched in 2005, has been a game changer. Bottled at a higher strength, this has fresh green apples, buttercream, lime, and kumquat, with a fresh acidic tartness, butterscotch, crushed peppercorn, and dried chili flakes. Dark toffee, Brazil nut, chocolate, peppery spices, and toasted oak on the palate. Lively finish of spice and chocolate toffee. <em>Best Value</em>",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
87,Jefferson’s Reserve Twin Oak Custom Barrel,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"This nose is all dry, earthy oak, tightly wrapped in rawhide, but underneath lurks plenty of sweetness, like overripe bananas, with the slight bitterness of citrus oils or orange pekoe tea adding balance. Pleasing coffee and mocha flavors also emerge on the palate, but the oak feels poorly integrated, with a green-stick quality. Finished for 4 months in a custom grooved barrel. (42,000 bottles)",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
87,Bunnahabhain Palo Cortado Cask Finish (1997 vintage),,Single Malt Scotch,350,"One of six whiskies released in Distell’s first Malt Collection. This received a secondary maturation of almost 2 years in Palo Cortado casks, rarely used for Scotch whisky. Melon slices sprinkled with salt, vanilla, and finally, peach blossom on the nose. More peaches on the spicy palate, with milk chocolate and oak. Peppery in the medium-length finish, with aniseed. (1,644 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Glenfiddich Fire and Cane,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"The fourth release in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this expression comprises peated and unpeated single malt, matured in bourbon barrels and then finished for 3 months in Latin American rum casks. A nose of spiced rum, vanilla, ripe pears, and pipe tobacco. Baked apple, sweet oak, and cinder toffee on the palate, with ashy smoke. Peppery sweet peat, rum, and brittle toffee in the relatively short finish. <em>Best Value</em>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Laphroaig Cairdeas Fino Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,80,"‘Cairdeas’ is Gaelic for ‘friendship.’ This bottling was aged in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing period in fino sherry casks. The nose offers lemon cheesecake smoked in peat, with brine, almonds, and oysters. Full and rounded on the palate, with stewed fruits, ashy peat, antiseptic, and more brine. The lengthy finish features licorice, tar, rock salt, phenols, and citrus fruits.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Old Pulteney 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"The only survivor from Old Pulteney’s core range shake-up of 2018, this has been matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks.

87,Old Pulteney Huddart,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"This NAS expression is part of the new 2018 Old Pulteney core lineup. Initially matured in second-fill American oak and bourbon casks, it was finished in bourbon casks that previously held heavily peated whisky. Sweet woodsmoke, crème brûlée, green apples, and cinder toffee on the nose. The smoke is more peat-induced on the palate, with banana fritters, and subtly sprinkled with sea salt. The finish features caramel and herbal notes.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Deerhammer American Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,54,"This porter-style, 100% malted barley single malt has a nose of dark chocolate and coffee beans that’s also slightly herbal, with a note of wood and a subtle, pleasant sweetness. Toasted oak leads on the palate, with sugared espresso, cinnamon, dried flowers, and an ashy back note. More coffee, chocolate, and coconut punctuate the finish. Aged at least 2 years, this whiskey is surprisingly complex considering its relative youth, and is quite unique.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Manatawny Still Works Keystone Whiskey,45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"This whiskey is made from four separate mashbills of malt, wheat, oats, and rye, and aged in oak for 12 to 36 months.

87,Grangestone 12 year old Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,34,"An Easter basket of aromas and flavors. Delicately floral on the nose, with rose petals, hibiscus, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and a hint of pastry shop. Similar characteristics show on the palate, where sweetness stops short of saccharine: orange cream candies, bubble gum, and cherry soda lead into a short finish with a jelly-bean sweetness. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Jamie Stewart,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,16,"An entrancing nose shows ripe apples and peaches, blueberry pie, earthy and saline peat, and fresh citrus. Although light, the palate has an enjoyable fruity character with layers of grapefruit, candy apple, kettle corn, wild berry, and orange Creamsicle. Water does not benefit this—drink it as-is. Aged at least 5 years. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,MacQueens of Scotland 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,22,"A delicate blend that manages to express richness in its simplicity. Perfumy and floral on the nose.

(<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Grant’s Triple Wood,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,17,"Refill bourbon, American oak, and virgin oak are the woods in question. Technically, they are all American oak, just at different flavor-giving stages of their productive lives. Honey, fresh apricot, floral, and supple barley notes, candied orange, star anise, dried chili, and a touch of aniseed. Exceptionally smooth with caramel, date, red fruits, chocolate, and pecan pie, finishing with wood char and spice. One wood three ways, I grant you. Previously labeled as Grant’s Family Reserve",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
87,Breuckelen 77 Bonded Rye,50.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Part of Breuckelen Distilling’s Bonded Series, this rye starts with fresh wood and some candied fruit on the nose, as well as vanilla frosting, lemon, and cigar wrapper.

A strong finish has notably good length and reveals more flavors of dark chocolate, raspberries, blueberries, black cherries, licorice, and gentle wood spices.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,ScotchMe!,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,34,"And you shall be scotched: vanilla, fudge, eraser-tipped pencils, spoonfuls of thick lemon curd, rhubarb compote, root ginger, and cumin. This malty dram has a decent weight behind it, with rich caramel, chocolate-flavored toffee, deep notes of orange and zested limes, plum fruit, and well-balanced peppery spices. A little spice, dusty chocolate, and Horlicks on the finish. A solid whisky, so just holler if you want some. (1,200 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
87,Hotel Tango Bravo Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Fresh wood, pine forest, and grassy meadow greet you on the nose—followed by lemon, coriander, and some warmer notes of ginger and shortbread. The palate is sweet, with chocolate, caramel, hints of almond, licorice, cinnamon, and clove, balanced against notes of anise, pine nuts, dill, and black pepper. The finish is punctuated by polished oak and spiced chocolate. This craft expression is youthful, but is also dynamic and complex.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Vesey’s Straight Bourbon,47.0,Craft Whiskey,48,"This bourbon from South Carolina’s Charleston Distilling Co. has a nose that starts with a chalky minerality, but fruit leather, strawberry, and blueberry quickly emerge, along with notes of candy corn, caramel, and chocolate fondue. The palate offers bitter chocolate, grape, and cherry, with caramel, roasted nuts, and coconut lingering on the back palate. The finish is nutty and bittersweet, with lingering fruitiness on a warm and chocolaty finish.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Whiskey Acres Rye,,Craft Whiskey,45,"This high-rye expression (75% rye) has a nose of citrus, dried tea leaves, and a fennel note, rounded out by a pleasant sweetness that’s laced with Christmas cake, cocoa, clove, and cinnamon. The palate is rich chocolate balanced by citrus oil, nutmeg, walnut, and white pepper. The finish is warm, silky, and full. Well integrated, balanced, and sophisticated, this whiskey is elegant beyond its age.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Trader Joe’s 10 year old Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,26,"Saline and earthy on the nose, lifted up by green apple, Juicy Fruit gum, and mango. A pleasant smokiness—more cigar wrapper than peat—wafts through the palate’s juicy roundness of mango, green apple, and Red Vines. More tobacco leaf and toasted oak on the finish. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Trader Joe’s Ardmore 10 year old Highland (Distilled in 2008),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,33,"Mineral and saline peat and brine, along with a slight rubberiness, are balanced by white pepper, orange marmalade, lemon, herbs, and grilled apples on the nose. The drying and smoky palate is light-bodied, but with generous peat, lemon, and herb flavors, finishing with oak, smoke, and more lemon. If you’re looking for a peated single malt that’s more gentle in body, try this one. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Trader Joe’s GlenAllachie 13 year old Speyside (Distilled in 2004),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Earthiness and aromas of toffee apple, stewed fruit, ginger, allspice, walnuts, and dried figs sweep into a sweet, raisiny palate that also has flavors of candied nuts, semi-dark chocolate, dried fruit, caramel, and apples. Sweet, with almonds and chocolate on the finish—lots of tasty sherry flavors here, but an uncomplicated character. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Ainsley Brae 12 year old (Distilled at Royal Brackla),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"An array of tropical fruit aromas—guava, papaya, green banana—mingle with incense, fresh herbs, and homemade cranberry sauce. The palate is light, silky, and flavorful: strawberry, pineapple, grapefruit soda, and milk chocolate, with a brief cigar-wrapper finish. A higher proof would go a long way to turn this whisky from merely pleasant to excellent. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Glen Ness 12 year old Highland,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,28,"Classic sherry aromas of raisins, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, and cooked plums prime the palate, but pay attention: a hint of peat is there, presenting beautifully as smoke and saline, along with sweet almond, gingerbread, chocolate-covered raisins, and hazelnuts.

Chewy tannins provide a foil for lively spice on the palate—pepper, ginger, anise, cinnamon—while orange oil, cola, cherry cordial, and black tea provide supporting notes. The finish shows generous earthiness and oak. Takes water well.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,The Famous Grouse Ruby Cask,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"The port cask finish wraps the toffee and baked orange in an extra layer of richness. There is subtlety in the aroma of the port notes, with red cherry and dried cranberry mingling with well-integrated spices in the background. Richer dark caramels infused with red fruits, including cranberry, red currant, and pomegranate, chased by feisty spices. The finish has concentrated red fruit juices, nougat, and long-lasting spices.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Johnnie Walker Black Label Triple Cask Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"This lighter, fruity, spicy whisky is not for peat lovers. Bourbon, whisky, and rum casks were used for finishing, resulting in a nose of rich honey, golden syrup, peach stone, apricot, honeydew, coriander seed, ginger, and white pepper. Citrus, butter fudge, dried and tropical fruits, rumbling spices, and tangy orange create a creamy combination, from which a familiar Johnnie Walker identity suddenly snaps into place. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Wild Turkey Longbranch,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Redolent of marshmallow and vanilla, this is restrained on the nose, but revels in pretty sweetness, with peaches and cream, ripe banana, and circus peanuts candies. On the palate, this collaboration with actor Matthew McConaughey betrays some of its Wild Turkey pedigree, capturing the house earthiness. For its modest proof, it pours a bit hot on the palate, with plenty of oak tannins, making it a nice sipper on the rocks or with water. <em>Value pick</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Arran 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Launched in 2006 as the first mainstream Arran bottling with an age statement, it is sweet and malty on the nose, with fresh-planed wood and toffee apples. The palate is fruity, with ripe banana, honey, vanilla, coconut, and wood spices. Spicy orchard fruits and malt in the relatively long finish. Well-balanced and eminently drinkable at this age. The quality has improved since earlier bottlings.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2003 Vintage),,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This follows the first limited release of the 2002 vintage Peat Week. Like its predecessor, this was distilled during the distillery’s annual week of peated production. Significantly peatier on the nose than the 2002, with Islay-like phenols backed by sweet floral notes. Sweet smoke, vanilla, citrus fruits, and honey on the bold palate, while the finish features more vanilla and honey, plus spicy bonfire smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Glenfiddich 14 year old Bourbon Barrel Reserve,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,54,"After 14 years in bourbon wood, this was finished in heavily-charred new American oak barrels, sourced from Kelvin Cooperage in Louisville, Kentucky. Malt, vanilla, and fudge on the nose, with ripe apples and lively oak. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, and cinnamon on the palate, while the finish is nutty, with notes of char. The closest Glenfiddich gets to producing a bourbon! <em>Value pick</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Penderyn Legend,43.0,Welsh Whisky,50,"This madeira-finished whisky delivers a beautiful combination of crunchy red apple, dried apple rings, toasted oak, cubes of vanilla fudge, honey, and dabs of orange. It’s a friendly dram and it draws you in; attractive but not flashy or abundantly fragrant. Soft fruits, though not instantly sweet, accompanied by vegetal notes, almonds, and some spicy bitterness, with ginger, pepper, and clove encircling the tongue.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Amrut Single Malt,46.0,Indian Whisky,65,"Made from Indian barley, the nose is soft, fruity, and spicy. There’s cooked apples in crème anglaise, ripe apricot, sweet barley, nectarine, fresh mango, sticky cotton candy, and dry oak spices. Creaminess continues on the palate, with apple, aromatic spices of pepper, ginger, and aniseed, with passion fruit, clementine, and zested limes. This should be your starting point for exploring Amrut’s whiskies.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Elijah Craig Small Batch,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"A solid, basic bourbon, with pure sweetness, honey, marzipan, and wildflower notes. The sweet drive is nicely backed with drying oak on the pronounced finish, like sucking on a sweet and woody cherry Popsicle stick. A simple and enjoyable crowd pleaser, and smaller sibling to the Barrel Proof, our <a href=""/top20/2017/1-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-b517/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2017 Whisky of the Year</a>.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Corsair Wildfire American Malt,50.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Distilled from hickory-smoked malted barley. The nose leads with dark barbecue smoke, mulberry, orange peel, cedar chest, and winter campfire. Earl Grey tea, tobacco leaf, orange oil, and black pepper dominate the palate, along with a great deal of thick, heavy smoke. A lot of new wood character and slightly rough around the edges, but compelling. The sort of whiskey you’d find in a crumbling tower deep in the woods.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
87,FEW American,,Craft Whiskey,50,"Laden with herbs and spices—mint, caraway, earthy ginger—on the nose, along with furniture polish and lemon. The palate is oak-driven and rich, full of dark chocolate, zippy caraway, roasted lemon, and ginger. There’s a pleasant fruitiness as well, but the finish is dry, all gentle spice and chocolate. Takes water well—in fact, a few drops helps to tame some of the punchy heat. A blend of bourbon, rye, and malt whiskeys.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
87,Clyde May’s Alabama Style,,American Whiskey (Unspecified),36,"A host of sweet confections awaits in this whiskey, which appears to be Kentucky bourbon with some types of added flavoring. Big caramel gives way to angel food cake, crème brûlée, lemon chiffon, and batter. But it doesn’t stray far enough to resemble a flavored whiskey, delivering an oily texture and nice viscosity, oozing with apple, citrus, grape soda, and hints of leather. Not one for the purist, but enjoyable all the same.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Basil Hayden’s Two by Two Rye,40.0,Rye Whiskey,45,"Bright, delicate, and approachable. While not a showstopper, it delivers generous sweet fruit, almost candied red apple sweetness, along with floral and black cherry notes. On the palate, it shows modest structure, with notes of lemon and pistachio, along with gentle wisps of baking spice and sandalwood. A blend of two Kentucky straight rye whiskeys and two Kentucky straight bourbons.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Colkegan Single Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"A dry smoke, led by brisket, dry oak, and cherries. Sweetly smoky in the mouth, with black pepper, cayenne, and barbecue flavors, as well as grilled fruits, nectarines, and charred plums. A good balance of sweet and spicy, with a backbone of minerality. The mesquite flavor amps up in the long and spicy finish.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
87,Jura Seven Wood,42.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Part of the Jura range exhibiting ‘sweetness and smoke.’ This was aged in first-fill American oak barrels and finished in six different types of French oak casks. Nutty on the nose, with freshly sawn wood, savory notes, and emerging ripe peaches. Very fruity on the palate, with tangerines, fudge, cinnamon, and toasted oak. Drying in the finish, with nutmeg.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Tommyrotter Napa Valley Heritage Cask Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,70,"A bowl of sweet, fresh cherries greets you on the nose, the result of the Napa cabernet cask-finishing, and it melds well with notes of lemon zest, chocolate, and a hint of smoky charcoal. The palate delivers more cherry as well as strawberries, which combine with marshmallow and whipped cream, and the finish has plenty of length. It’s a bouquet of chocolate and berries, with impressive subtlety and complexity.",David Fleming,Fall 2018
87,Hamilton’s Islay,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,20,"Malt and seaweed drying around rock pools, this builds up a good head of dry, fibrous peat smoke, with sautéed mushrooms, chocolate nibs, and ozone. Sweet lemons and sugar mice on the palate, it slides into a creamy-smooth pool of milk chocolate, the smoke kicking in later on, dragging a layer of clove and pepper in its wake. Proof that an Islay experience need not break the bank.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Dancing Goat Limousin Rye,46.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"A Wisconsin rye aged in used American oak and new French oak, then finished in a Limousin oak solera. Heavily perfumed; incense and sandalwood on top of leather, gentle wood, and pleasingly soft rye spice. Golden raisins, white flowers, and violets on the palate, with a sweet and balanced finish. Softer and less assertive than traditional rye whiskeys, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
87,G. Rozelieures Origin Collection,40.0,French Whisky,40,"Hailing from the Lorraine region, this single malt is double distilled in Charentais pot stills. Orange flesh, lemon sherbet, strawberry bubble gum, candied fruit jellies, grapefruit, and dry spice, with shades of vanilla on the nose. To taste, a wishy-washy orange note with a thin structure hung with milk chocolate, mango juice, papaya, wood spice, and ground ginger, concluding in a pulped-fruit ending.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Samaroli ’S Peaty 2017,45.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,317,"Encompassing more than just Islay malts, the youngest liquid in this is from 1995. Malt loaf, peat barns, heavy salty smoke, hazelnut latte, roasted fennel seed, star anise, and sooty embers. This one could set the smoke alarms off. Good weight in the mouth, with pears in chocolate, clove, aniseed, vegetal notes, and deceptively less smoke until the powerfully intense finish of spice, soft fruit, cocoa, and seemingly eternal smoke.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Four Roses,40.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"Lovely cinnamon candies offer an entrancing first taste, with lemon drop and orange sherbet close behind. Baking spices come on strong mid-palate, with undertones of caramel and vanilla. But what makes this special is its mouthfeel: tingly and warming the palate throughout. Cinnamon is ever-present.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,Aberlour 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It offers a nose redolent of Christmas pudding: figs, sultanas, orange, honey, and cream. Smooth on the palate with sweet spicy sherry, orchard fruits, and caramel. Raisins and plain chocolate in the lingering finish, with Jaffa orange notes to the end.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
87,BenRiach 10 year old Curiositas,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Introduced in 2004, Curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by BenRiach. It has been peated to 55ppm and matured in bourbon casks. Mildly medicinal earthy peat on the nose, hot road tar, honey, and light tropical fruit aromas.

Peaches in cream on the palate, a suggestion of madeira, milk chocolate, and Brazil nuts. Cocoa, citrus fruits, and light oak in the medium-length finish. <em>Value pick</em>",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
87,Collingwood Town Collection Double Barreled,45.0,Canadian,34,"The warehouses at Brown-Forman’s Canadian Mist Distillery in Collingwood, Ontario hold some rare beauties, including this one, the result of an experiment using a mashbill rather than processing the individual grains separately. Malty on the nose, with hard candies, Jujubes, and vague sour-mash bread notes. Palate is floral, gently perfumed, with sweet vanilla, mild peppers, barrel tones, and mildly pulling tannins. Long, pleasantly hot, cereal-rich finish. (Canada only) $44 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
87,Pearse Founder’s Choice 12 year old,42.0,Irish Single Malt,60,"Pearse Lyons Distillery opened in 2017, becoming Dublin’s second working distillery this century. This single malt has a nose of honey, apple pie with cream, light pepper, dried grasses, and green herbal notes. The orchard fruits of apple and pear are silenced by a fury of pepper, root ginger, and clove, with only grapefruit peel proffered in response. The dry, banana chip finish fades in a melee of squabbling spices. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
87,Miyagikyo Rum Wood Finish 2017,46.0,Japanese,,"This gentler, naturally fruity whisky seems to benefit less from the rum than the peated Yoichi, the effect particularly heightened on the palate. A nose of warm muffins, fruit salad, faint citrus, the spiciness of fennel and pepper, with botanicals in a tropical palm house. Quite spicy, it evokes pepper and ginger, with pineapple, lemon wedges, lime, ripe melon, and some late maltiness. Cinnamon and peppery spice to finish. (3,500 bottles; sold as a set with Yoichi Rum Wood Finish 2017) €395/set",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
87,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Highland Park) 2003 14 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,135,"The nose is muted, with gentle orchard fruits, subtle malt, nougat, and nutty toffee. The palate, by contrast, is bold and offers big fresh fruit notes, notably zesty tangerines, along with crème brûlée. Dry peat notes follow. Earthy peat smoke and white pepper with a citrus tang in the long finish. (230 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
87,Shelter Point Artisanal Single Malt,46.0,Canadian,66,"Distillery owner Patrick Evans grows much of the distillery’s barley on his 380-acre farm on the shores of British Columbia’s Straits of Georgia. In 2011 Evans and distiller James Marinus fired up the distillery’s two Forsyths copper pot stills. The resulting single malt is creamy, malty, and slightly minty. Citrus fruits, peach pits, and stimulating white pepper slowly fade into gentle barrel notes. (Canada only) $85 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
87,Lohin McKinnon Wine Barrel Finished,43.0,Canadian,47,"Single malt whisky from British Columbia-grown and malted barley, matured in bourbon barrels, then finished in wine barrels from Black Sage Vineyard in B.C.’s Okanagan Valley. Malted barley leaps from the glass along with a vague earthiness and mild fruits. Malty cereal on the palate, with vanilla, hot spices, milk chocolate, and purple grapes.

87,Whiskey Del Bac Winter Release 2017,50.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"An intriguing nose of campfire smoke drapes the distinctive aroma of mesquite charcoal, dark toast with honey, and pretty floral notes. On the palate, the blast of initial sweetness gets swept up in burnt matchsticks, peppery heat, and wood tannins. A bit hot on the finish. This is a big, in-your-face, meaty whiskey that any barbecue brisket fan will relish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
87,Redemption,42.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,29,"Initially, floral and fruit meet oak and a cadre of baking spices. Then it’s a plethora of vanilla in several forms, from icing to pudding, followed by notes of butterscotch, fudge, Oreo cookies, and pecan shell. Sweet cigar tobacco and honey follow this home to a short to medium finish with a hint of peach cobbler. Ideal for cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,Redemption High Rye,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,29,"Sweet and smoke open this interesting whiskey that bounces from sweet to savory throughout.

Hazelnut and salt water taffy jump in for a quick note just before a medium finish with a hint of smoke.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,Redwood Empire American Whiskey,45.0,American Blended Whiskey,45,"A blend of 11, 5, and 4 year old bourbons blended with 2 and 3 year old ryes. Pine, cedar, and cigar box offer a pleasant botanical and masculine nose that has slight hints of dill and roasted corn. It’s bright and extremely interesting, with notes of Mexican chocolate, strawberry and orange Marmajam, rye toast, and peanut butter.

87,John L. Sullivan,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,26,"Drink to the Boston Strong Boy, the last bare-knuckle boxing heavyweight champion of the world. The nose is bright: apple, pear, vanilla pod, lime zest, orange peel, puffy marshmallow, and light toffee. As the gloves come off, the palate rolls with the punches of malt, apple, vanilla, and spearmint, parrying jabs of brown sugar, caramel, and stroopwafels. It’s light on its feet and delivers nutty, spicy finishing moves.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
87,The Balvenie 1993 23 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This was aged in a refill American oak hogshead, as was the 1981 expression. Like that variant, it has pineapple and lemon on the nose and also yields milk chocolate, green apples, and fresh-sawn wood. Smooth, full, and sweet on the palate, again with very ripe tropical fruits, plus apple pie. The finish is medium in length; quite austere.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
87,Highland Park Full Volume,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Full Volume is a U.S.-exclusive bottling that was distilled in 1999 and matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose is fragrant, with canned pears and vanilla ice cream, coconut, and a very subtle wisp of smoke. Quite thin on the palate, nutty, mildly herbal, with tropical fruits. Ashy peat smoke, cocoa powder, and wood spice in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
87,Balcones Texas Blue Corn Bourbon (Batch BCB17-1),,Craft Whiskey,80,"The concentration here is impressive, as dates and raisins meet leathery oak that smells of a dusty tack shop, joined by some lovely cinnamon, clove, and spearmint. The intensity on the rich palate is face-melting, hot, and muscular. Sweet flan, caramel corn, and vivid spice succumb to a finish built for oak lovers, drying and a bit tannic, bringing the molten sweet flavors to an end too soon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,St. George Single Malt Lot 17,43.0,Craft Whiskey,100,"Exhibits the floral, rose petal, and fresh meadow character often found in St. George malts. The palate pours with white peach and apricot, coupled with warm cereal notes. A delicate whiskey that might have benefited from higher proof, but remains enjoyable for its lingering sweetness, elegant character, and unmistakable craftsmanship.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,Westward American Single Malt,45.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"A true American single malt; the impression of new charred barrels distinguishes this from its Old World counterparts, while the creamed honey, caramel, and candied nuts keep the wood in check. On the palate, the wood influence delivers big vanilla and hints of smoky char, coupled with nicely concentrated flavors of Turkey Golden table syrup, fruit, and spice. A nice rendition of New World single malt, showing proof and gusto.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,Bone Snapper X-Ray Straight Rye 4 year old (Batch 1),55.0,Rye Whiskey,50,"At first, fruit and charred oak own the moment, only to be interrupted by petrol, florals, and earth. Spice sets in with an abundance of sweetness following. Then, a lovely explosion of fresh-baked rye rolls with hints of pomegranate, orange peel, banana, and apple. Pepper spices remain to the end where a medium finish, with hints of cinnamon await.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
87,Remus Repeal Reserve Series I,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Starting with floral, fruit, and perfume notes, its prominent bouquet barely allows the undertones of honeysuckle, spice, and oak to shine through. On the palate, honey, canned peaches, tobacco, and crème brûlée lead the way just before an explosion of vanilla layers the palate in the form of cake batter, icing, and a white fudge-dipped Oreo. However, bitterness sets in, causing a slight unbalance and lingers toward the medium finish.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
87, Uncle Nearest 1856,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Slow-roasted corn, marzipan, cinnamon, nutmeg, and kettle corn start this experience and slowly fade to corn on the cob with butter, salt, and pepper. Then, it’s apple cider vinegar, deep-fried mushrooms, and Nutella. Fried pie dough and hints of chocolate appear before a medium finish that has a hint of toffee.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
87,Tincup 10 year old,42.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Pretty violet and floral notes lead the way, with herb garden and chocolaty oak draped over caramel chews. The creamy palate offers marshmallow and a candy store mélange of Jolly Ranchers and Swedish Fish, before the finely balanced oak comes in, meeting the sweetness with sandalwood and rye spice. A lovely effort that places balance above sheer power.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,The Temple Bar Signature Blend,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"This blend is full of bold flavors: sweet barley, oranges and lemons, fudge, and pastel-colored macaroons. There is plenty of body, with vanilla, brown sugar, strands of citrus, fudge, and spice. It seems slow to warm up, the flavors a little lost for a few seconds before it gets its act together. Lengthy finish of buzzy spices, lemon peel, and caramelized brown sugar.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Kurayoshi 8 year old,46.0,Japanese,80,"Heady with spring blossoms, mixed peel, cantaloupe, green banana, and taffy candy, with a fine thread of spices running through it. A hesitant opening, it wallows in gentle apple and orange before a strong tangerine streak appears, the mouthfeel becoming weightier, drawing through flavors of peppery herbal salad leaves and vanilla cream. The spices take the lead from then on, the fruit fading quickly in the peppery afterglow. (1,440 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Kurayoshi Sherry Cask 8 year old,46.0,Japanese,100,"Age adds a richer, creamier note suggestive of lighter styles of sherry, more fino or manzanilla, perhaps a cream sherry. The fruit note is more rounded, the nutmeg, clove, and pepper deliver a stronger kick. Ripe yellow fruits with melon and apple, not too sweet, followed by a sharper edge of light sherry. By comparison, the younger whisky has more fruit to balance out the nippy spices. (720 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Reisetbauer 12 year old,48.0,Austrian Whisky,131,"Peppermint cream, menthol, whole plum, cranberry, and very delicate toasted-wood spices. The palate has cooked apple, Fruit Pastilles, plum flesh, malt, drinking chocolate, and brown sugar. As time progresses, it develops a slight sourness, with the spices spreading out wide under the tongue. The final phase conjures up a char note, black tea, and burnt sultana bread, leading to a finish of spices and dulled stewed fruit.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,William Wolf Rye,46.0,Netherlands Whisky,35,"This 100% rye has a beautifully developed nose of roasted coriander seed, white pepper, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, though the spices dominate and impede other characteristics from shining through. The initial mandarin and tropical-fruit sweetness is left behind as the peppery spices roar away. The finish sees the spices vanish into thin air, as if teleported back to the mother ship. Ideal for rye-based cocktails.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Mt. Logan 15 year old,40.0,Canadian,35,"Rather than complexity, this all-corn whisky showcases softness and a rich creamy mouthfeel—even if it does meet the Canadian definition of rye whisky. Peppery spices with a keen bite come from the barrel, not grain. Berries and corncobs add depth to fruit cocktail, with sharp spices balancing a lush waxiness. Its syrupy feel evolves into kiwi fruit flavors and tartness on the finish. ($45CAD; Canada only)",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2018
87,Lost Spirits Abomination The Sayers of the Law,54.0,Miscellaneous,50,"Aromas of smoked meat, kelp, saline, rubber, and butterscotch pudding make for a sweet and savory first impression. Flavors of burnt sugar, vanilla custard, cooked apple, dark cacao, black pepper, and salty umami carry through on a big, aggressive, hunger-sparking palate. The finish is unsweetened chocolate, ash, and pepper—bold and unapologetic, it responds well to water.

Actual Time in Barrel: 18 months;

Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland, then blended, exported, and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of charred oak treated with Riesling wine.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
87,Connemara Original,40.0,Irish,55,"Exudes beautiful soft peat notes, barley sugar, and apple-cinnamon granola. Light lemon and honey, with a delightful growth in apple crumble flavors, golden syrup, and more peat smoke and orchard fruits on the finish. Drink this neat.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch Wine Cask,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Blender Aimée Gibson set out to make a sundowner scotch by incorporating whiskies matured in wine casks. The blueberry, blackcurrant, and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote, raspberry, strawberry, and lingonberry with light spices. A late resurgence of dark toffee, chocolate, and cigar smoke blow into the finish. Sip away by all means, but this fruity sensation calls to be served up in long, cool drinks.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Benromach Organic 2017 (distilled 2010),43.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"The latest version of the first certified organic Scotch whisky is a creamy malt that has lashings of vanilla, banana peel, and pecan pie aromas. Smooth, malty flavors abound. Banoffee pie topped with sliced banana, apple, nectarine, and ripe peach, with a good flare of peppery spices. Fuzzy, earthy spice, then an outro of sweet fudge. With water, more green fruit, melon, tropical fruits, and a little chili kick emerge.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Highland Park Magnus,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Named for Highland Park Distillery’s founder, Magnus Eunson. It has been matured in first-fill and refill American oak sherry casks. The nose offers honeysuckle, vanilla, rising bread dough, and faint, aromatic wood smoke. Slightly smoky orchard fruits on the early palate, with sultanas, ripe cherries, and cinnamon. Medium to long in the finish, with drying fruit notes, wood spice, and ultimately, licorice sticks. (<i>U.S. exclusive</i>)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
87,Wemyss Family Collection Treacle Chest,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,62,"The new Wemyss Family Collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. Raisin, date, fruitcake, stewed apple and plum, cumin, coriander, allspice, and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. Gingerbread, plum, and dark orange draw the mouth. Fruity sweetness, but never sugary; there are jam tarts, walnut, and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6,300 bottles) £47",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon,40.0,Craft Whiskey,49,"This light-hued bourbon is bright and airy, with tropical fruit aromas of papaya and lychee, vanilla, and sweet lemon curd. While not especially bourbon-like it’s interesting and super-likeable for its Bit-O-Honey candy and pleasingly nutty notes. Last reviewed in 2011.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
87,Ohishi Sherry Cask,,Japanese,75,"This has the warming comfort of cask strength rice pudding, with just enough rice character peeking through the sherry. Marzipan, sultana, fig, and toasted spice. Nutty <i>amontillado</i> notes load up on dried fruits, including apricot, mango, and apples pricked with cloves. The late phase includes black cherry, old leather, cola-flavored candy, and burnt fruitcake. A quick fizzle of spice and dried fig turns slightly savory.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Grangestone 12 year old Highland single malt,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,33,"The nose is inviting, with marzipan, malt, ripe bananas, milk chocolate, and cinnamon. Green fruit notes emerge later. Very sweet on the smooth palate, with bubble gum, satsumas, peaches, and delicate spice. The finish is medium to long and persistently sweet and fruity, with a hint of dark chocolate at the end. Sure to satisfy a sweet tooth.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
87,Rock Oyster 18 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,116,"Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals, green tea, pine cones, peppermint creams, and charcoal. The tasty palate has sweet fudge, heather honey, and mandarin, which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. Smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. Finish is hot, drying, with smoke and ginger spices. Decent enough, though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Clonakilty,,Irish Blended Whiskey,50,"Ahead of the distillery opening, Michael Scully is working on a series of Clonakilty releases in the warehouse. His promising first release is bourbon cask matured, with a nose of raspberry, strawberry taffy, roasted coriander seed, star anise, apple, green fruits, and smoldering cooperage oak. The palate brings mandarin, light honey, sweet oak, creamy vanilla, fresh banana, peppercorns, and custard. Vanilla sweetness and a welcome spicy buzz to finish. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Highland Park Valkyrie,,Single Malt Scotch,71,"Valkyrie replaces the current Dark Origins expression and was matured in a combination of first-fill American oak sherry casks, American oak bourbon casks, and European oak sherry casks, along with some refill casks. Apricots and aromatic wood smoke on the nose; slightly oily, with raisins. Stewed fruits on the palate, with earthy peat, licorice, and black pepper. Aniseed, dark berry notes, and wood spice in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
87,Ichiro’s Malt & Grain Whisky,,Multinational Whisky,115,"Delicate aromas of chamomile, marigolds, gardenias, peaches, apples, and vanilla undergirded by biscuity cereal notes transition seamlessly to an elegant palate of vanilla, green apples, malted milk balls, and fresh herbs. The finish has gentle spice that fades into warm chocolate with continuing creamy grain. A blend of Japanese and other whiskies that responds well to water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2017
87,Hazelburn 9 year old Barolo Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,123,"Distilled in June 2007 and bottled in October 2016, this expression spent 6 years in first-fill bourbon casks, then 3 years in Barolo wine casks. Fresh on the early nose; herbaceous, with pineapple and a hint of oil. Big in the mouth, with white pepper, more pineapple, dried fruits, and coconut milk. Drying to tannins, with dark berries in the lengthy, minty finish. (10,800 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
87,Alberta Rye Dark Batch,45.0,Multinational Whisky,30,"A blend of Canadian whisky with 1% sherry and 8% bourbon. Dried and stewed fruits, baking spices, leather, and earthy tobacco blanket light-bodied vanilla sweetness. Assertive dark chocolate and coffee, raisins, and prunes are balanced with sweet peppered jerky. The generous sweetness is tempered with water. Finishes like a Cadbury Fruit &amp; Nut bar, but with more personality.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2017
87,Bushmills Red Bush,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,23,"Are you a bourbon lover with an untapped curiosity for Irish whiskey? I have a job for you. Try nosing out the cinnamon, molasses, sultanas, tarte Tatin, and sweet crème brûlée on Colum Egan’s young creation aged in first-fill bourbon casks. A brash combination of spice, cinnamon, cooked apple and pear, caramel popcorn, bitter vanilla, and spun sugar, which finishes with wood char, burnt sugar, and toffee apple.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
87,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 42 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,106,"Rich notes of baking chocolate, compacted dry earth, runny caramel, and garam masala highlight the versatility of aromas between these expressions. Chocolate digestive biscuits, plain chocolate nibs, caramel, a hit of mouth-puckering pepper and chili heat, but the chocolate endures. A zinging finish akin to Tache spiced bark.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
87,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Benrinnes) 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,170,"Distilled in October 1995 and aged in refill hogshead #8937. Slightly earthy on the early nose, with allspice, vanilla, then creamy toffee and caramel notes emerge. Big, boiled sweet notes on the full palate: nutmeg, soft toffee, and aniseed. Long and drying in the finish, with chili spice. (261 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
87,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Highland Park) 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,345,"Distilled in March 1992, this single cask expression was matured in a refill hogshead (#1266). The nose yields heather in bloom, a hint of machine oil, vanilla, orange fondant creams, and a wisp of sweet wood smoke. Smooth on the palate, with creamy orange notes, gentle spice, and, ultimately, soft peat smoke. The finish is relatively long, with Jaffa orange, black pepper, and drying oak. (209 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
87,Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"The power of pure burning peat smoke, lemon-scented floor polish, pine needles, salt spray, and delicate vanilla places this squarely among the archetypal whiskies from Islay. Sweet lemon, custard cream biscuits, and hints of smoked goose lend an oily mouthfeel. A combustible climax of smoke, spice, and earthy peat kindle a red-hot finish that will have you puffing smoke like a chimney.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
87,Nomad Outland Whisky,,Multinational Whisky,45,"A 5 to 8 year old blended scotch married for 3 years in sherry casks in Scotland and finished for 12 months in Pedro Ximenez casks in Jerez. The nose has luscious figs, raisins, molasses, and berries, brightened with apricot-tangerine notes when water is added. The palate is intense: Fig Newtons, dark chocolate, raisins, and orange peel, finishing with honey, Raisinets, and chocolate-covered nuts—a soft, slightly under-proofed conclusion, but still satisfying.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2017
87,Lohin McKinnon Barley & Rye,43.0,Canadian,56,"Mild peat smoke wafts into the room as soon as you pull the cork. A big fruity nose ripe with red apples and hints of ether rides the peat. Sweetish spices glow with hints of chocolate, then fade slowly into typical malty tones that in turn become dry cereal notes. A flash of soapiness on first sip never returns, but lessens an otherwise beautiful young whisky. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2017
87,Classic Cask 23 year old Oloroso Sherry Butt,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,160,"A charmingly sweet nose with Christmas cake, swollen raisin, dates, sticky toffee pudding, walnut, nutmeg, and gentle spices confirm the presence of the <em>oloroso</em> cask at work. An oily texture, with butterscotch, tangy peel, and mandarin, becoming darker and nutty, with sultana and plum skin shading into menthol and streaks of bitterness. Finally, Brazil nut, macadamia, and clove, with a hot, dry, nutty finish. (771 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
87,Benromach Sassicaia Wood Finish 2009,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,48,"This vintage Benromach has been finished in Sassicaia wine casks from the Bolgheri wine region of Italy after maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Red currants and warm peat, ginger, and vanilla on the nose. Initially, juicy fruit on the palate, but soon drier than expected from the nose. Dark berry fruits and subtle smoke develop. Relatively long in the finish, with gentle spices. Ultimately, sweeter soft fruit notes return. (8,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
87,Bladnoch Adela 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,138,"Samsara’s (<em>reviewed winter 2016</em>) younger sibling Adela presents an altogether different profile, having been matured in <em>oloroso</em> casks. Like Samsara, it has not been chill filtered. The nose is nutty, with quite dry sherry notes and prickly spice. Finally, fragrant toffee emerges. Very supple in the mouth, where the sherry becomes sweeter, along with black currants, licorice, and then black pepper. The finish is medium in length, dry, and peppery.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
87,Talisker Neist Point,,Single Malt Scotch,180,"A showcase of the wide range of Talisker’s characteristics. Very sweet fruits, vanilla, new leather, and a hint of brine on the nose.

(<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
87,Mackmyra Blomstertid,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,68,"Angela D’Orazio matured a third of the component whiskies in cherry-wine casks for this seasonal creation. Rather than cherries, the fruity aroma of the wine is more apparent on the nose, together with crushed root ginger, hawthorn, drying tobacco leaf, and beefsteak tomatoes. This thick-textured dram exudes cherry, strawberry, and vanilla fudge, drawing the mouth before a late phase of rum and raisin, aniseed, peppermint, and menthol. 598 SEK",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
87,Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Single Barrel (barreled 2/11/2004),,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"At first it’s a smorgasbord of cotton candy, vanilla, caramel, tapioca pudding, honey, and salted caramel. Then spice-bomb reality sets in with nutmeg, cinnamon, anise, and ginger. Finally, the spice gives way to caramel over cornbread, malt, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The medium finish ends what was developing into a great whiskey; alas, much is to be desired.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
87,F.E.W. Delilah’s 23rd Anniversary,50.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Lovely aromas of charred toast, nut bread, biscuits, fresh grain, rye spice, and some grassiness give way to a palate-coating sweetness, including malted milk balls, cocoa, and dark baking chocolate. The finish offers fine balance, with cherry fruit nicely matched with drying oak tannins and laced with sandalwood and spices. Vatted from 23 barrels, primarily bourbon and rye, though the malt component offers great backbone.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2017
87,Gordon & MacPhail 10 year old (distilled at Glen Grant),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"This expression of Glen Grant has been matured in refill bourbon casks and is arguably more characterful than the distiller’s own variant of the same age. Ripe orchard fruits on the nose, with honey and cinder toffee. The palate is light to medium in weight, offering more fresh fruit notes, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of ginger. The nutty finish dries with just a hint of smoke.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
87,Gordon & MacPhail Distillery Labels 10 year old (distilled at Scapa),43.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"This expression from Scapa in Orkney was distilled in 2001 and matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Tropical fruit and butterscotch on the sweet, light nose, with very slight smokiness on the early palate, along with spicy, milky cocoa, hazelnuts, and more tropical fruit. The finish is medium in length, with a hint of char. An easy-drinking, nicely balanced dram at a good price.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
87,anCnoc Rutter,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Another expression from anCnoc’s first batch of Peaty Collection releases, this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio, at 11 ppm. Initial peatiness on the nose gives way to sliced pineapple, nougat, and spicy vanilla. Ripe apple, milk chocolate, and honey emerge out of soft peatiness on the palate. Old leather and a hint of spice in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
87,Scapa Glansa,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Glansa is described as a “peated whisky cask finish,” with the majority of its unspecified maturation time being spent in first-fill American oak casks. Madeira notes on the nose, with vanilla, honey, and pears. Richly fruity on the palate, with cocoa powder, vanilla, caramel, and mild wood smoke. Dark berries emerge from the background. The dark fruits continue through the lengthy finish, where smokiness increases.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
87,High West American Prairie Bourbon (Barrel #2683),,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Finished 2 years in Quady Black Muscat barrels. Deep amber, ruby hues. Richly sweet, with raspberry preserve, pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, prune, honeysuckle, vanilla, and black tea. Dry leather finish cuts through the sweetness. Unique and peculiar.

87,Black Bull Kyloe,50.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,29,"Kyloe is the old Scots name for the famous hairy, horned breed of Highland beef cattle, better known in Scotland as a <em>Heilan coo</em>. This bright NAS whisky has aromas of fresh orange, lemon, grapefruit, and light muscovado sugar. It is soft and sweet to drink, with lemon sherbet notes, some fruity piquancy, and rich butterscotch, with some peppermint creeping in on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
87,Mars Maltage Cosmo,43.0,Japanese,92,"A fusion of Japanese and Scotch whisky from the owners of the Mars Shinshu Distillery, who have recently opened a second distillery named Tsunuki. Dates, treacle, red cabbage, and maitake mushroom add intrigue. Light-textured, sweet and juicy, with burnished orange, toffee apple, dark caramel, but some lackluster spices. The texture becomes fatter with dilution, as damson flavors emerge. Finish of bonfire toffee, flat cola, raisins, and spice. £75",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
87,BenRiach Tawny Port Wood Finish 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,137,"This bottling replaces the 15 year old Tawny Port Wood Finish. After first maturating in bourbon barrels, finishing took place in tawny port casks. The nose offers vanilla and milky coffee, with peppery red berries and a hint of plain chocolate. Vanilla, toffee, orange, and spicy oak on the palate, while the finish is long and warming, with more spicy oak. £110",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
87, GlenDronach Cask Strength (batch 5),,Single Malt Scotch,72,"This batch of GlenDronach’s popular cask strength has been aged in a combination of <i>oloroso</i> and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks.

87,Glenfiddich Project XX,47.0,Single Malt Scotch,62,"One of two initial releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this is a non-chill filtered expression. A vatting of twenty casks, including first-fill bourbon, sherry butts, and port pipes. The nose is fragrant and faintly oriental, with vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and apricots. The palate is full and sweet, with oranges and lemons, fudge, plump sultanas, milk chocolate, and tangy spices. Drying steadily to fruity oakiness in the relatively lengthy finish. £50",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
87,Mannochmore 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,400,"Along with Auchroisk, Mannochmore is one of Diageo’s well-kept secrets. This 1990 distillate was matured in first-fill American oak hogsheads and European oak butts. Oily orange notes on the nose, plus vanilla, brittle toffee, and honey. The palate is substantial, rich, and sweet, with figs, sultanas, banana, and more honey, plus developing cloves. Raisins and plain chocolate in the long, spicy finish.

87,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Invergordon) Mocha Moment 1988,46.0,Single Grain Whisky,127,"A rather moreish grain, and Wemyss certainly nailed the chocolate orange aromas on the nose here. Bright bursts of rich orange and comforting milk chocolate accompany gentle underlying spices, star anise, treacle-drizzled hams, and Godiva mint pearls. The palate is easygoing, with chocolate muffins, condensed milk, dates, and milky Coco Pops. There is oak, but it’s never obtrusive, and of course, cold mocha that fades slowly, until the moment has passed. (240 bottles) £102",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,Jim Beam Signature Craft Soft Red Wheat,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Confectionary goodies all around. Vanilla, caramel with milk and chocolates: dark, Mexican, sweet, and white. Lots of chocolate. It’s soft and gentle, with zero spice, only rich chocolate and caramel with hints of grain and fruit, but this richness cannot be overstated. If you love chocolate and caramel, this is your dream bourbon. It finishes long and strong with a hint of—you guessed it—chocolate. Price is per 375ml",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
87,Kavalan Solist Port Cask,,Taiwanese Whisky,110,"Admirably, they go to all the trouble of bottling single casks individually for their Solist range at Kavalan Distillery. This single cask has the most gorgeous, deep ruby color and a very fruity nose: pomegranate, fresh orange, plum, walnut jam, macadamia, and some zestier elements. At full strength, it’s mouth drawing; warm, fruity, with stewed plums, young rhubarb, pepperpots, and fine-quality dark chocolate. A clean finish, with the fruit and wood spices remaining fresh to the end. (181 bottles) NT$3,500",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,Angels Envy Cask Strength (2016 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,180,"No two Angels Envy Cask Strengths offer the same aromas. Here, cotton candy, honey, roasted pecan, and chocolate malt. Then a strange turn on the palate; roasted corn, dark chocolate, honey syrup, mashed cherry, caramel, Scotch ale, and cinnamon. Smoked cherrywood, hickory, milk chocolate, strawberry preserves, orange peel, and peach cobbler. What were once multiple fruit flavors now become a single cherry turnover with a sprinkle of cinnamon. It finishes medium with cherry.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
87,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Islay Blended Malt #1 23 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,102,"This is a sophisticated and finessed take on Islay blended malt, which must be Kilchoman-free given the age statement. Driftwood, waxy lemons, soft buttery fudge, banana milkshake, dry grasses, and the gentlest puff of smoke promise calm seas ahead. A silken dram, anointing the palate with lemon meringue pie, honey, and caramel. This becomes creamier, with faint tendrils of smoke and dancing spices through to the finish. Utterly charming and tremendous value for the money. (419 bottles) £82",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Irish Single Malt 1991,,Irish,156,"The Boutique-y incursion into Irish whiskey leads with this splendid vintage. Rejoice in this fresh, clean nose with sweet barley, lemon zest, lime pith, vanilla frosting, and early summer florals cut with a slight saltiness. This flavorsome whiskey has thick, juicy oils, and progresses from an early citrus dominance to reveal ginger, pepper, and ground almond. Water magnifies the citrus to great effect. £125",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Irish Single Malt 2001,,Irish,84,"Bonfire smoke, sea salt caramel, and plain chocolate, with a dry minerality and a reassuring, dusty garden shed aroma. Chocolate and ripe fruit on the palate, with pears, some tart acidity, candied jellies, then damsons, sultanas, cocoa, and cinnamon. The creamy mouthfeel slides into Bourneville plain chocolate. The peatiness is well integrated, supporting the alignment of flavors: the smoke outlasts the fading chocolate-cinnamon finish. Best neat, as water blunts the precision and enjoyable sharp edges. £67",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Paul John 6 year old (batch 2),,Indian Whisky,125,"Great to see an age statement on this second Boutique-y Paul John release. It’s aromatic, with hoisin sauce, sweet plums, clove, black pepper, and a cloud of heady peat smoke. Sweet, dark toffees, vanilla, apple danish, poached pear, and baked orange swim above an undercurrent of peppery spice. Water provokes more smoke on the nose, more apples on the palate. The dry finish leaves singed vanilla and the satisfaction that you’re puffing out perfect smoke rings through pursed lips. (173 bottles) £100",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,Douglas Laing Scallywag Cask Strength (batch 2),,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,62,"Rich marmalade, gingersnaps, dried tropical fruits, vanilla pods, and cinnamon bark abound on this limited edition, top dog whisky from Douglas Laing &amp; Co, which includes Mortlach, Macallan, and Glenrothes. The satsuma peel acidity settles quickly to show off its tricks of green apple, spices, hazelnut, Maltesers, and ginger. Late development brings out plain chocolate squares, maltiness, and intense coffee notes. Water picks out chocolate orange truffles. Coffee cups and chocolate biscuits to finish. My tail is wagging for more. (4,800 bottles) £50",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,Westland Garryana Single Malt (2016 edition),,Craft Whiskey,125,"This holds real promise for the scotch lover. Interesting vanillin oak, peaty phenols, and adhesive bandage balance the generous, sweet malt foundation. Robust on the palate, but far from fiery, the mouth coating peat takes charge of the marshmallow-sweet malt, before dusty cocoa and dark chocolate win out across the long finish. Like other Westland efforts, this tries hard on many fronts and succeeds on some. It’s hard to deduce what the Oregon <i>Quercus Garryana</i> oak actually brings to the whole.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
87,Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Garnheath) 41 year old 1974,,Single Grain Whisky,277,"Mid-period Garnheath here, the distillery existing for barely 20 years. This brings aromas of freshly ground pepper, oils, soft fudge, and dry monkey nut shells. The fudge is smothered by spices exploding in the mouth: ginger, nutmeg, pepper, and cinnamon. Warm toffees, oak, and citrus emerge late, but boy, this dram has great stamina and length. Sure, the finish has an oakiness, slight sourness, and a gentle, spicy pepperiness, but water subtracts more than it gains. A genuine rarity. (141 bottles) £222",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,Tom’s Foolery Ohio Straight Bourbon (barrel 19),,Craft Whiskey,60,"With 4 years 3 months of age, this is a fine selection, with poached pear, stone fruit, brown sugar, and floral aromas nicely integrated. At cask strength, it serves up a bold and spicy punch to the palate, with peppery notes that quickly overpower the dried corn, treacle, and caramel sweetness. A little water allows that sweetness to shine through before the slightly tannic finish of drying oak and black walnut. <i>(Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)</i>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2016
87,Wayne Gretzky No. 99 Red Cask,40.0,Canadian,34,"If you close your eyes, the first whiff will carry you into a shoe store with its clean leather and vague, sweet, waxy polishes. A beautifully constructed, fruity, creamy, full-bodied whisky that shows hints of dry cereal, ripe red fruit, orange liqueur, and early on, something vaguely like grape tannins. Clean sparkling peppers enhance the lush fruits, while almost citrus-like barrel notes cleanse the palate with their slightly pulling, oaky finish. Very tasty. <i>(Canada only) </i>$45 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
87,Barr an Uisce Wicklow Rare,43.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,50,"Care for a small batch, bourbon-matured blend with a 20% malt content finished for 6 months in <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks? Thought so. Clementine, ripe plum, and a firm, peeled-banana nose with vanilla, warm citrus, banana, raisins, and base notes of peppery spice. There’s plenty of structure and complexity on this well-balanced blend, which ebbs away with red fruits and strawberry bubblegum. Continuously juicy, with a butter toffee and white pepper finish.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
87,Compass Box Enlightenment,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,"This torchbearer for the Compass Box Scotch Whisky Transparency campaign is looking for your support. A fruit medley of lemon, lime, gooseberry cream, and soft pineapple chunks. Ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh, spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. It makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness, never becoming bitter. One thing is clear, it’s a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5,922 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
87,Michter’s Limited Edition Barrel Strength Rye,,Rye Whiskey,75,"Think of sitting on the front porch swing, legs up, a good song playing, and this smooth barrel strength rye. It’s an easy sipper, from the allspice and old-style licorice to the cadre of caramel and vanilla expressions that intertwine custard and German chocolate cake. You don’t expect sweetness, but it’s here, and lasting. If it has a weakness, it loses its intensity about mid-palate, but rebounds with a healthy medium-length finish.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
87,Tullamore D.E.W. 14 year old,,Irish,79,"Following a 6 month period of finishing in the same four cask types as its older sibling <em>(see above)</em> we get a fruity nose of cherry lips, black currant juice, brambles, Cox’s orange pippin, taffy candy, and the citrus acidity of oils squeezed from the peel. Oh, it’s sweet, syrupy, and spicy; a fruity cocktail of apple and strawberry. Diminishing spice and bright rustic apples usher in a rewarding finish. A complex and distinctive recipe, for sure. €70",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
87,Grand Traverse Ole George Double Barrel 100% Straight Rye,,Craft Whiskey,64,"The quality is instantly discernable, even as the rye grain takes a back seat to layered aromas of cherry and dark currant, coupled with sweet notes of brown sugar and treacle underscored by fresh oak, toasted spices, and dark chocolate. Beyond its richness and depth, this beams bright and lively on the palate as grapefruit zest meets rye bread, followed by a finish of harmonized sweetness and spice. Aged 3 years in American oak; finished in French oak.<em> (Distillery only)</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
87,Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve  (No. 3403),60.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"There’s a marriage here, one of perfect harmony; fruit, floral, spice, sweet, and expressive toasted oak. Then the broad genres become specific: the fruit is cherries; the floral, a hint of lavender; the sweet, an array of toffee, caramel, and vanilla, until its spice complexity kicks in, showing allspice, white pepper, Spanish anise, and nutmeg. Its proof never shows, but the medium finish is just a touch short to make this truly special. <em>(New Hampshire only)</em>",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
87,Stalk & Barrel Single Malt (Cask 83),46.0,Canadian,70,"A growing number of Canadian craft distillers are making Scotch-style single malt whisky, and several, including Still Waters, do quite a good job of it. Round, leafy, cereal notes on the nose give rise to a granular fruitiness, delicate oak, caramels, and glowering peppers on the palate. It’s beautifully balanced, lush, and mouth-filling, and though delicious now, with a few more years it would be stellar. Lovely hot peppers, sweet grassiness, yellow fruit, and a long spicy finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
87,"Signatory Vintage 10 year old (distilled at Edradour, Cask 41)",46.0,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Part of Signatory’s Un-Chillfiltered Collection, this was distilled on February 25, 2005 and bottled on November 25, 2015. Initially a little earthy on the nose, then more fragrant, with orange blossom, nutmeg, and a hint of polished oak. Oily and rounded on the palate, with supple sherry influences: prunes, dates, more orange, and tingling spices, plus toffee. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of smoke and lingering spicy Jaffa orange notes.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
87,Barrell Bourbon Cask Strength 5 year old (Batch 007),,Bourbon/Tennessee,85,"5 years is when bourbon really starts developing complexity, and you find the beginnings of greatness here, with saltwater taffy, vanilla custard, citrus, corn pudding, and a healthy dose of cinnamon. Its proof offers satisfying warmth that quickly turns to spice. Medium finish gracefully gives a hint of warm vanilla icing. In an age of barrel strength bourbons, this is a good one, but lacks complexity for higher praise. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
87,Jura 16 year old Diurachs’ Own,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Diurachs are the inhabitants of the Isle of Jura, and this single malt named in their honor is initially matured in bourbon casks before 2 years of finishing in <em>amoroso</em> sherry casks. Floral and honeyed on the nose, with caramel, pine, and spicy dark chocolate. Sweet and oily on the palate, where the chocolate changes from plain to milk, with vanilla and delicate cloves. Darkening chocolate and drying oak in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
87,Swiss Highland Classic,46.0,Swiss,124,"From the Rugen distillery in Interlaken, this was filled into American oak <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts and rolled into the Rugen Mountain rock cellars that were built in 1875.  Almond, glacé cherry, apricot, wood spices, and nougat create a very active nose. A lightness of touch, with vanilla, honey, strawberry, and raspberry make for a juicy mouthfeel, despite a swell of black pepper and ginger. It just grows and grows. The fresh fruits seem impervious to the dying spices. CHF119",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
87,1792 Single Barrel,,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Ripe fruit (peach, apricot, golden raisin) on the front of the palate, followed by layered sweet notes of caramel, butterscotch, and toffee, finishing with oak, dried vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon. Great mouthfeel. Each barrel is unique in flavor profile. There’s no barrel number identified on the label, so the one you buy may vary slightly. Having said this, the barrel I reviewed was very enjoyable.",John Hansell,Summer 2016
87,Ardbeg Dark Cove,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Maybe not as massive as its higher-strength brother <em>(see above)</em>, but don’t think that this is light. There’s immediate grumbling peatiness, mixed with dark chocolate, lanolin, and tamarind, while the spiciness brings to mind tandoori food. There’s still the seaweed element, while the lower strength pulls things into a darker core—coal tar soap, damp moss. A very oily palate, that with water takes you onto the peat bog. Seashells on a fire and more smoke round things off.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
87,Balblair Vintage 2005,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Launched in December 2015, the first release of Balblair’s Vintage 2005 replaces the previous 2003 expression. This is the youngest bottling in the brand’s portfolio. It was matured in bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is relatively light and fruity: vanilla, ripe bananas, honey, a wisp of smoke, and soft spices.  Toffee, malt, vanilla, a biscuit-like note, more bananas, and new leather on the palate, closing with a lengthy, spicy finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
87,Highland Park ICE Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,270,"ICE Edition is a 17 year old matured predominantly in bourbon casks. Just 30,000 rather extravagantly presented bottles are available globally.  Fresh and fruity on the nose with light trademark Highland Park sweet smoke, ginger, and a hint of dry earth. In time the fruits become more clearly defined as pears and peaches. Full and viscous on the palate; vanilla, pepper, brief orchard fruits, then dry peat, licorice, aniseed, and a lingering, relatively dry finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
87,The Macallan Edition No. 1,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"People tend to moan about Macallan having lost its mojo. Not here. This is a vatting of different sized American and (mostly) European oak casks, so no surprise that it’s oak-led, but Macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. Here you get rosin, marmalade, green fig jam, and the power of concentrated oils. The palate is powerful and supple, with some clove, ginger, and yet more chocolate. Substantial and well worth checking out.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
87,Wemyss Malts Waffles and Ice Cream (distilled at Clynelish) 1997,,Single Malt Scotch,144,"Released in Wemyss Malts’ Cask Strength Single Cask Releases range. This expression of Clynelish was aged in a refill hogshead. Initially, big coffee and ginger notes on the nose. Sweet orchard fruits develop in time along with a pinch of table salt. Very sweet and spicy on the palate with icing sugar and soft toffee. Salt, white pepper, and light oak in a long, spicy finish. (274 bottles) £100",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
87,Spirit of Hven Tycho’s Star,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,132,"Named after a supernova, not the Seven Stars, this uses a mashbill of pale ale, chocolate, and heavily-peated malt, with three specific cask specifications. Toffee apple, cotton candy, gentle leaf smoke, dry seasoned logs, cacao, vanilla seeds, and ripe bananas. A lighter mouthfeel with juicy sweetness, mixed peel, cinnamon, dry banana chips, mild ginger, chocolate notes, and cocoa. The finish feels short, then out of left field it hits you with a surging wave of chocolate and coffee.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
87,Wood’s Alpine Rye (Batch #2),49.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Now here’s an interesting mashbill: 73% malted rye, 13.5% chocolate malt, and 13.5% cherry-smoked malt. Nose is an arresting mix of bitter, grassy rye and smoky dark chocolate; abrupt, but it grows on you. It’s all there on the palate, too: rye oil, sweet malt, cherry smoke, pipe tobacco, raw oak. This is rambunctious stuff, with an intense but not hot finish, a very craft-beer whiskey. Unlike similarly shouty bottlings, this one has something to say as it shouts.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
87,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenturret) 1987,,Single Malt Scotch,151,"This Glenturret was bottled in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular series at 28 years old. After maturation in a single refill hogshead it was released in early 2016. Malt, milk chocolate, and honey on the pleasing, mature, rounded nose. Figs and sultanas develop in time. Smooth and rich on the palate with more malt, cocoa powder, and soft spices. Very long in the finish with quite insistent spice, citrus fruit, cloves, and sweet oak. (168 bottles) £105",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
87,The English Whisky Co. Peated,,Single Malt English Whisky,90,"There is wonderfully sweet smoke on the nose that overrides a base layer of fresh mint and mounds of velvety cocoa powder. Neat, there is a powerful alcohol kick, a harbinger of sweet purple berry fruits and brown sugar before it settles down as it dilutes with pools of calming milky cocoa and chocolate. Give this a good splash of water and it will reward you handsomely, unlocking extra layers of sweetness, fresh melon, and lime. (290 bottles,<em> The Whisky Exchange only</em>) £62",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
87,Ladyburn 41 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,1750,"Ladyburn malt distillery was part of William Grant’s Girvan grain distilling complex in Ayrshire from 1966 to 1975. It was located close to where Ailsa Bay now stands. This veteran bottling is mature and rounded on a nose of sweet pears, nectarines, subtle vanilla, and a hint of old hemp. Fresh fruit and lively spice on the early palate, with worn leather and malt.  The fruit lingers through the very long finish with oak, licorice, and slightly bitter citrus notes.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
87,Royal Mile Whiskies 40 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,288,"A terrific value blend of Macallan, Glenrothes, and Tamdhu matured in sherry casks has produced one of the darkest whiskies on the market. Inescapable aromas of thick Seville orange marmalade, polished saddle leather, too-hot-to-hold sweet chestnuts pulled from a brazier, dry fruitcake, 100% cacao, and Medjool dates. Sweet prunes, chocolate ganache, cola, tannins, and singed wood spices combine to produce a formidable proposition. Heavily sherried and oaky for sure; this has been bottled not a day too early. (337 bottles,<em> Royal Mile Whiskies only</em>) £200",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
87,Two Brewers Yukon Single Malt Release 1,46.0,Canadian,74,"Assorted mashes and barrels ensure each batch of Two Brewers malt whisky is unique. When mature, about 7 years later, these are blended into multi-layered whiskies. Sweet, crisp nose, then Cheerios, dry grain, and fresh malt. Vague herbal tones balance hints of ripe fruit. Bright palate with gingery peppers sprinkled on fall fruit—soft apples, plums, peaches. Lush body, then a slight woody, tannic pull<em>. </em>(<em>Canada only</em>) C$95",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
87,Starward,43.0,Australian Whisky,60,"Vanilla pod, dark toffee, fudge, manuka honey, and chocolate-dipped banana bites greet the senses, quickly followed by a palate of tiffin, raspberry jam, damsons, poached pear, slightly bitter cacao, and Nutella scraped across hot toast. Smooth, medium weight. Malty notes emerge, yet sweetness battles to the fore. This is the taste of modern, young Australian whisky: Australian barley, Australian barrels, and matured in the Australian climate at Melbourne’s New World Whisky distillery. Unsurpassed drinkability: it just wants to please. A$83",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
87,Arran The Bothy Quarter Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,80,"A limited edition of 12,000 bottles, this expression from Arran was initially matured in first-fill bourbon barrels before a secondary period of aging in American oak quarter casks, which accelerated maturation. A big hit of tinned peaches, then malt, cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel. Sweet and rounded on the palate, with lots of fresh fruit, notably pineapple, plus caramel, chili, and ginger. Relatively long in the fruity finish, with brittle toffee, new oak, and persistent spice. £55",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
87,The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1978 37 year old (Cask #2708),,Single Malt Scotch,,"After the 68’s quiet nature, we reach Balvenie in fully mature, robust character—well, as robust as Balvenie ever gets. That means more cask-derived notes of vanilla ice, butterscotch, <em>crème brûlée</em>, and a jag of citrus bringing you to your senses. There’s squidgy caramel toffee and the honey is now fixed in the comb adding that distinct waxiness of old, gently matured whisky. The biggest and sweetest of the series. Excellent.",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
87,Benromach 15 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The aim with Benromach was always to rediscover an older Speyside style, and this shows how well owner Gordon &amp; MacPhail has succeeded. There’s a profound sherried introduction, just a little malt, then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. The palate is properly old-style and oily, with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. Chewy and medium-bodied with good layering.",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
87,Glen Garioch 15 year old The Renaissance Chapter One,,Single Malt Scotch,108,"The first of four ‘chapters’ under the Renaissance banner, all of which will consist of spirit made since Glen Garioch reopened in 1997. This 15 year old release has been matured in sherry and bourbon casks, and 12,000 bottles are available. Ginger features on the early, perfumed nose, with soft toffee, oranges, and dates. Milk chocolate on the creamy palate, where the ginger theme continues, along with cinnamon and caramel. The finish offers rich chocolate and orange, which finally fades. £75",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
87,Glenmorangie A Midwinter Night&#039;s Dram,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"This NAS Glenmorangie contains whisky aged in bourbon casks and some that was ‘extra-matured’ in Spanish <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks, as per Glenmoragie Lasanta. The result is a variant with more of a winter fireside vibe than found in Original. The nose boasts dates, plain chocolate, caramel, and Jaffa oranges. Rich and fruity in the mouth, with more oranges, plus sultanas, roasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and ginger. The finish is medium in length, fruity, gingery, and ultimately slightly bitter. £40",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
87,Springbank Green 13 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,77,"This is the second ‘Green’ release from Springbank, denoting the use of organic barley, following on from a 12 year old in 2014. This variant has been fully matured in sherry casks and 9,000 bottles are available. White pepper, ozone, and wet sand on the early nose. Ultimately, cocoa powder, baked apple, and sultanas. The palate is initially very sweet and spicy, with salt and fruity sherry developing. The finish is medium to long, warming, with a salty tang.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
87,High West Yippee Ki-Yay (Batch 1),46.0,Rye Whiskey,65,"High West Double Rye is transferred into vermouth and Syrah barrels, making for an interesting limited release. Herbs, blackberries, black currant, and black pepper are vibrant, followed by a medicinal hint of mint. The vermouth comes alive, with earthy notes meeting the rye’s traditional spices, a welcome back and forth with hints of black fruits. The warm, medium-length finish offers another hint of mint. If you like vermouth, you’ll love this.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
87,Bastille 1789 Single Malt,43.0,Single Malt French Whisky,64,"The Daucourt family from Angoulême in the Cognac region produces their single malt using French spring barley. It is aged in a variety of casks: Limousin oak, cherrywood, and acacia. The signature tangerine note is there, along with vanilla fudge and sweet, spiced dried apricots. Warming, preserved-orange notes and honey make for a buttery smooth dram with a growing spiciness, as you would expect from the French oak. A tongue-tingling spicy finish. Vive la révolution!",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
87,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 (Batch 2),52.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,178,"If you like warm chocolate ganache sprinkled with cocoa beans, dark waffle cones, praline, and brisket bark, then this is for you. A brief flicker of chocolate, smoke, cherry, peppery spices, and chili flakes move aside for a smooth medley of dark fruit juiciness and sweetened char notes. The strident call of chocolate on nosing goes unreciprocated on the palate. A long, satisfying, deep finish of pounding spices. A worthy successor to the first batch. (417 bottles) £123",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
87,Paul John Bold,46.0,Indian Whisky,58,"This new peated expression exhibits the billowing, rich smoke of burning fruitwoods, warm banana-and-honey muffins, and caramelized brown sugar granules seared onto puff pastry. Tasting this evokes spiced apple, cinnamon, and orange peel, with more peat coming through mid-palate, mingled with Brazil nut, menthol, eucalyptus, clove, and peppermint. A warming glow trickles slowly down, leaving hot smoke and menthol behind. With whisky of this quality, master distiller Michael John will only gain further followers of his work. £40",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
87,Adelphi Limerick Selection Slaney Malt 23 year old,,Irish,194,"This dark, ruby colored dram rouses the senses with its nose of poached pears, raspberry coulis, cherry blossom, marshmallow, menthol, and chocolate-dipped cherry. It has a rich, throbbing fruitiness in an oily, slick texture backed by cola cubes, Tunes lozenges, and cherryade. It peters out, leaving the palate numbed with faded fruit juiciness. Distilled back in 1991 and matured in refill bourbon cask #8585, this is special occasion stuff. (134 bottles) £134",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
87,Five & 20 Afterburner Bier Schnapps,,Craft Whiskey,25,"Clear and unaged in a tall, thin, grappa-like 375 ml bottle; “Afterburner” is a bit intimidating as a name. “Distilled from grain and fermented with hops.” Nose of new make and hops, with aromas of rhubarb and fresh blood. Herbal and refreshing on the palate, bitter with the hops, a certain resiny stickiness to it. Much more than just new make; almost tonic-like. Nicely done!",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
87,Hochstadter&#039;s Straight Rye Whiskey,50.0,Rye Whiskey,35,"“Vatted” from five 4 to 15 year old straight ryes from Canada, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, in an old-timey bottle. Classic spice-candy-bitter nose leaps out of the glass with 100 proof heat; friendly. Easily drinkable at this proof, well-integrated rye oil and grain sweetness, some cinnamon and dried apple, and the barrel rolls in on the finish. A neatly-wrapped package, and not crazy on the price. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
87,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection 1838 Style White Corn Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Fresh-shucked sweet corn on the nose, a wisp of hot clove spice, some fresh grassiness; a clean aroma. True on the palate, with a bit of fresh cob as well, and firm oak. Lean and a bit leathery in the Woodford style, but lighter in the mouth; is the lightness from the white corn? I like this; I tend to give Woodford a bit more latitude in these essays.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
87,Bowmore Mizunara Cask Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,1000,"It’s only right that the first single malt scotch given a period of time (3 years in this case) in Japanese oak (<em>mizunara</em>) casks is from Beam Suntory-owned Bowmore. It’s a fascinating mix of the vanilla, spice, and incense notes of <em>mizunara</em> and Bowmore’s distillery characteristics. You get rich peat, black pepper, apricot, and peach all playing alongside each other. The palate is clean and lighter than the nose suggests, with a fresh zestiness before the smoke leans back in.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
87,Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1997,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,85,"Distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2014, this expression of Dalwhinnie spent a period finishing in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. The nose offers honey, ripe oranges, peach blossom, and creamy milk chocolate, with just a wisp of smoke. Full-bodied and sweet on the palate, with orange zest, walnuts, more honey, and fruit spices. The finish is long and warming, with a hint of peat and spicy oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
87,Royal Brackla 21 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,270,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar &amp; Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.

More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
87,The Antiquary 35 year old,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,460,"The aromas can be split into four; fresh fruits (raspberry, blueberry), desserts (vanilla custard, bread and butter pudding), antique shop (polished furniture, well-oiled moving parts), and stewed fruits (apple, rhubarb, some old orange peel). Wisps of balsa wood smoke; tangy orange notes build, accompanied by those fresh fruits, sweet oak, aniseed, and white pepper ending on black treacle and gingerbread. The finish is epically long; dry, floral, with parkin, residual wood notes, and further smoke evident. (800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
87,Kilkerran Work in Progress VII – Bourbon,,Single Malt Scotch,85,"The 2015 Work in Progress releases are the last before the single malt becomes a permanently-available 12 year old in 2016. 6,000 bottles are available. Creamy malt, marzipan, and vanilla on the nose, with pears, instant coffee, linseed, and a hint of table salt. Soft and slightly oily on the warm, spicy palate, with immediate ripe apples, caramel, and slight smokiness. Long and slowly drying, with a touch of aniseed and brine.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
87,"Booker’s 2015-04 “Oven Buster Batch,” 63.5%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Aged over 6 years, this is a rather feminine version of Booker’s. It’s sweet, relatively gentle compared to previous releases, and quite fragrant (bordering on perfumed—especially on the nose). Creamy vanilla coats the palate, with suggestions of coconut macaroon and marzipan. Dried spice (cinnamon, mint) and drying oak on the finish keep the sweetness in check.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
87,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Imperial) 1995,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,325,"Fruits are to the fore here, super ripe, and dark in hue: think of plump plums, sweet black grapes, and hedgerow berries. That said, it is never heavy, as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. In time, some dried flowers emerge. The palate is equally sweet, with a little caramel and spice. It fades gently. Impressive and well worth a look. I wonder whether the new Dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
87,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 006),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Less driving aroma than Batch 005; lower floor? Both are a mashbill of 70/26/4% corn/rye/malt. More corn and cinnamon and bread dough in the nose here. A lot like 005, but more sweet cornmeal, less spice, less height in the mouth, and the finish is sweeter and longer. Might be that farmer’s younger brother; this one’s only 8 years old. Still good, a bit less complex. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
87,Wild Buck American Rye,50.0,Craft Whiskey,54,"NJOY Spirits makes this 100% rye from locally-grown rye, some of which they grow themselves…in Florida! It is approximately 1 year old, and quite dark. There’s a medicinal, dark pit fruit nose, overripe plum with some lighter red plum notes, a soft sweetness around the edges, and a hint of small barrel oak. Wow. Surprisingly smooth, up-front rye flavors, cushioned with a pleasantly odd sweetness with notes of cocoa and a soft rye finish. Intriguing.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
87,J.P. Wiser’s Hopped,40.0,Canadian,22,"“Boiling the hops made them too bitter,” says Wiser’s master blender, Don Livermore. After more than 100 attempts he cracked the fruity-floral-hops code by “dry hopping” – adding Bravo hops to the finished whisky. Searing spices energize the earthy, grassy aroma of a freshly-mown fall meadow. Caramels—some sweet, some burnt—with early blushes of coffee or milk chocolate slowly fade into a vaguely bitter finish. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$29",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
87,Glen Scotia Victoriana,,Single Malt Scotch,115,"The most expensive of Glen Scotia’s new trio has been finished in deeply-charred barrels and bottled non-chill filtered at cask strength. Soft and sweet on the nose, with peaches, fudge, and a hint of oak. Full-bodied and slightly oily on the palate, with wood spices, vanilla, and blackberries. Smoky ginger and lively char in the lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
87,Wemyss Malts Stem Ginger Preserve (distilled at Mortlach) 1995,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,133,"This is Mortlach in musing mode. An aroma that initially brings to mind a woolen mill, then opens into sweet spice, light syrup, with the sense of the distillery’s weight always present. A rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. With water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you’d expect, then comes rooty weight with, yes, a distinctly gingery slant. Water shows more beeswax/honeycomb. Substantial and spicy. £85",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
87,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glen Moray) 14 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,83,"Soft and direct. The initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath, then comes preserved lemon, greengage, and discreet maltiness. It becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. The palate is a little strong initially, then a hint of coconut. Improves further with water, showing a fascinating, subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. A classy dram from an overlooked distillery. Check it out. £53",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
87,Rock Oyster,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,59,"The final cornerstone of Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts range, this blended malt celebrates the best from the Islands. The peat smoke finds harmony with the nose of pine, lemon curd, dewy lawns, and vanilla fudge. This is gloriously full-flavored; the peatiness certainly delivers, but there is a pleasant nip of saltiness too. The black pepper finish leads to a long lasting salty smack on the lips. Make this your hipflask essential for bracing excursions along the shoreline. £38",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
87,Celtic Cask Deich 10,46.0,Irish,164,"Following bourbon cask maturation, this spent a further 4 years in red wine casks from Domaine Des Anges. It has a gentle, coastal brininess of smoked eel with apple relish, seashells, lemongrass, with beet root and black fruits. This is a real chewer; toffee bars, raisin, juiced apples, and raspberry. The smokiness builds powerfully and unrelentingly. After a final catch of smoke, the finish has lush mint toffees. A mighty, peaty Irish whiskey from you know where. (<em>351 bottles</em>) €150",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
87,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 004),,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"A nose like Big Red gum—juicy-sweet cinnamon—and some sweet dough, with sharp alcohol heat. Hot as expected on the tongue, but exciting: more cinnamon and sweetness—like snickerdoodles—with wet corn, a touch of bitter oil, and hot spearmint. Adding water eases the heat, and brings out the oak. Good stuff, if a bit simple. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
87,Bernheim Original Single Barrel 7 year old (barrel #5132718),45.0,Wheat Whiskey,33,"In a market myopically focused on big, old, and oaky, this Bernheim Original single barrel is an uncommon, subtle whiskey that invites you to lean in and listen closer. If you do, you’ll be treated to soft wheat intertwined with caramel, cinnamon, and subtle cherry. Oak gets added to the mix in the mid-palate, without dropping any of the other flavors established. The real star of this whiskey is the finish: long, dry, ice-cube cool, and extremely impressive. (<em>Drink Up New York only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
87,Canadian Club 1950s,40.0,Canadian,150,"After more than 60 years in cask this dignified, old-time Canadian Club flaunts its age with wood and faintly bitter oak tannins. Initially, the nose is closed, then opens into cedar with slightly musty wet paper and just hints of fruit. The fruit is big but undefined on the palate with overtones of brisk Epsom salts, sweet sandalwood, and blistering spices. Teasing hints of varnish, clean wood, and oat flakes linger long into the finish. <em>(Australia only)</em> A$195",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
87,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenburgie) 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,190,"Full gold. Big, robust, and sweetly fragrant, with honeysuckle, stewing elderflower. There’s some oak, but it’s not dominant. The palate starts creamy, then there’s some caramel toffee with good distillery character. It melds freshness with the extra weight gained by gentle maturation. There’s coconut and cassia on the end. You lose the sweetness with water, but you get more blossom and oak. Personally I’d go for it neat and sip slowly as a perfect summer dram. £130",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
87,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at BenRiach) 17 year old 1997 (cask #144744),,Single Malt Scotch,140,"BenRiach releases of this age are often peated or in a special barrel; here, we have an unpeated, non-barrel finish release. The nose is inviting, with Honeycrisp apple, toffee, malt, and a touch of oak. A very flavorful entry presents lush toffee, apple, malt, and ginger. The spice increases in the mid-palate, as well as the heat, but we don’t get much added complexity. A long, flavorful, and slightly dry finish round out a very tasty but ultimately simplistic whisky. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
87,The Exclusive Malts Islay 7 year old 2007 (cask #904),,Single Malt Scotch,145,"An Islay single malt of unknown origin aged in a bourbon barrel showcases many of the classic notes of a peated malt of this age with smoke, iodine, paste, and oak. On the palate the smoky peat unfolds nicely, as it’s exquisitely balanced by honey, salt, and caramel. The smoke intensifies in the mid-palate but never loses its balance with the sweeter undertones. A dry, long, smoky finish caps off a well-integrated and very enjoyable mystery malt. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
87,Girvan Patent Still Proof Strength,,Single Grain Whisky,110,"Apples squeezed in a cider press, sherbet Dib Dabs, and cinnamon sticks comprise the nose of this west coast grain whisky. It’s lip-tingling at cask strength; the lemon and molten honey tussling with the effervescence of the Dib Dabs before golden syrup pours over the tongue. It’s like crunching through a packet of powdery Love Hearts erupting in the mouth. Water encourages peach fondant French fancies flavors, with a slightly pushy fruit skin note at the finish.<i> £75</i>",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
87,Box The Challenger,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,95,"One part whisky from 40-liter sherry casks, using peated and unpeated batches, to three parts peated whisky aged in regular bourbon casks. Damp peat smoke, mint toffees, and a savory note on the nose, with a distinct mintiness continuing on the palate. A hot, smoky core is chaperoned with flavors of dry banana, vanilla essence, and white plums, developing a late creamy texture and a fresh minty finish. Surely, this will be approved by dentists everywhere? 837 SEK",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
87,Crown Royal Single Barrel Whisky,,Canadian,55,"This jaunty, rye-forward whisky from a mash of 64% corn, 31.5% rye, and 4.5% barley malt was distilled in an arcane Coffey still and spent seven years in new oak barrels. Flavors vary remarkably among barrels making each of these single barrel bottlings unique. This one exudes sweet floral perfume, vanilla, oaky tannins, sweet and sour sauce, spices, and basket loads of tropical fruits, all centered on soft banana candy. A long spicy, velvet tannin finish. <em>(U.S. only) </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
87,Glen Grant 50 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,14999,"Deep ruby with a yellow rim. Clearly mature, and heavily sherried. A highly concentrated nose: Marmite and soy sauce, and all the fresh fruits of youth reduced to essence. Drinkwise, it’s closest to Chinato: curative barks, dried herbs (mint, hyssop, oregano). The palate is unsurprisingly thick and lightly smoky, but the tannins aren&#039;t overly astringent, and there remains a sweet core still, even if the overall effect is dark. It’s not obviously Glen Grant, but it is a fascinating glass.",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
87,Glenrothes Vintage Reserve,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"A new NAS, this has a thick, silky nose in classic ‘Rothes style which reminds you of coffee cream icing, hazelnut syrup, semi-dried soft fruits, and horchata. The palate has elegance and poise, with a hint of menthol lifting off into pecan and light grippy oak. Has excellent length and mellow flow. Water slightly reduces its voluptuous charms, so be careful (or simply avoid). Praise for revealing all the vintages used, and the fantastic price. Chapeau! £39",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
87,Longrow Red 11 year old Port Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,82,"The latest incarnation of Springbank’s Longrow Red matured for 11 years in port casks before being bottled at cask strength. The nose is sweet, with cherries, caramel, new leather, chewing tobacco, and soft peat. Voluptuous in the mouth, with a palate of rich peat, summer berries, and toffee apples, with growing spice notes, and light oak. Lengthy in the finish, with cinnamon, peat, sweet oak, and red berries.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
87,Teeling Single Malt Whiskey,46.0,Irish,60,"A new multi-vintage core expression of independent Irish single malt compiled from a vatting of whiskey finished variously in port, sherry, white burgundy, cabernet sauvignon, and Madeira. The nose suggests honey, baked lemons, ground almonds, desiccated coconut, white pepper, and soft toffee. A fabulously thick texture; thank goodness for their insistence on non-chill filtering. It’s fruity with twinkling spice, pepper, root ginger, and vanilla orbiting around a fudge-like core. The oak is present on the dry finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
87,Exclusive Malts Speyside 10 year old 2004,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"This cask strength, port cask-aged whisky comes from an undisclosed distillery near Aberlour. The impact of the port cask is unmistakable, with a nose that is deeply fruity with dried apricot, blackberry jam, honey, and malt. On the palate these rich sweet fruit notes are well balanced by black pepper, clove, salt, honey, and a touch of dark chocolate. The underlying proof also helps counterbalance the sweet fruit and drives a medium length and slightly dry finish. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
87,Grand Macnish Black Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"I am hopeful this blended whisky has benefited from the alligator char treatment to contribute to the deep, rich color and charred smoke notes on the nose. A thick, velvety mouthfeel, with butter toffee, toasted marshmallows going gooey on a stick, great spices, vanilla, whole nutmeg, chicory, and the crust of a well-fired fruit loaf leaving some sooty cinders on the finish. A mighty fireside companion and my favorite Grand Macnish to date.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
87,Wigle Deep Cut Rye (Batch #5),56.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"“Local heirloom rye grains” are distilled (less than half a mile from the Monongahela River) in a copper alembic, aged 14 months, bottled at cask strength. Has a beautiful ruddy glow. Clean, focused nose of fresh rye grain, spicy-sweet with a nip of bitter oil in the back. Not a barn-burner, even at 56%, but brimful with rye spice, rye oiliness, and rye mint, and not over-oaked, either, as the finish closes evenly. A bit direct, but very nicely done!",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
87,Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,48,"After regular bourbon maturation, this is finished in a barrel made from toasted wood with no charring (and no age statement). The wood character of the nose is restrained; corn, vanilla, some nuts and light citrus, but just a light hint of oak spice. Complex mouth: corn pudding, cornmeal, sugar cookies, caramel, pawpaw, jackfruit, and a real creaminess that stretches into the finish…where we get the delayed oak. Mature whiskey smooth, young whiskey lively, and a good price, too. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
87,Balblair Vintage 2003,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Balblair Vintage 2003 replaces the previous 2002 expression, matured in second-fill bourbon barrels, with the contents of eighteen making up this first release. Tinned peaches and apricot jam on the nose, with underlying honey and caramel. Early malt, then zesty lemon notes on the palate, which also features freshly-cut grass and hazelnuts. The medium-length finish yields white pepper and cocoa powder.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
87,Bowmore Devil’s Cask Batch 2,,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Last year’s was a top-notch, defiantly sherried example of Bowmore. This year’s batch thrusts equally boldly, but starts in a more Japanese-accented fashion: think soy, miso paste, and salmon teriyaki. Light leather, with hickory campfire smoke coming through strongly. The big, oily, tarry palate is like a spent barbecue with a hint of skidding car tires on Bowmore High Street. So, still a belter, but why so limited? Beam Suntory, please sort it out! (6,000 bottles) £60",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
87,Caol Ila Unpeated 15 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,120,"The now-annual unpeated release shows its high strength on the nose, but under the burn is a clean, mineral, and slightly lean Caol Ila with just a tiny whiff of smoke. A mix of grassiness/herbal notes, with delicate white fruits that plump out into tinned fruit salad, gooseberry, and fresh pineapple. The palate is sweet and cake-like, while the heat enhances its salty tang. Delightful, sweet, and long. (10,668 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
87,Mackmyra Midvinter,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,81,"This wintery limited edition was finished in casks that previously held Bordeaux, Glühwein, and sherry. This achieves an appealing nose of orchard fruits and spices. Juicy apple, hints of conference pear, cinnamon, clove, vanilla tablet, and lemon pith. Apple is at the core of the flavor, but it’s rich with warming spices, strawberry, and zabaglione, tightening in the end to a conclusion of dried fruits, nut shells, and a twist of pepper. <em>(Sweden, France, and Germany only) </em>€65",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,73,"Meaning Swedish smoke, and they’ve nailed the juniper smoke perfectly here. Ripening lemons, fresh cream, Turkish delight, pine forests, and barley sugar aromas. Great poise and balance. A light, lacey structure comprising creamy fudge, honey, lemon, oak, and vanilla. It just dances on the tongue. Yet billowing puffs of smoke pulse from the center. Baked lemon peel ushers in a pleasurable rolling, smoky finish. This Röks! €59",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Tormore) 1988 Floral Trellis,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,189,"The nose is sweet (think barley sugar/boiled sweets) with little bits of wheat chaff flying around in the background with dried flower petals and drying cut grass. Opens dramatically with water into almond milk/horchata and flowers. The palate is sweet and lifted with those gentle florals to the fore. Instead of Tormore’s normal nagging rigidity, this flows sweetly over the tongue, leaving fruit leather, stewed rhubarb, and with water, rosewater and fresh wild strawberry. A lovely Tormore! £118",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
87,Anchor Bay,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,48,"Lombard’s blend of Speyside malts pleases with an agreeable nose of orchard blossoms, flower honey, caramel, dry hay, and pears baked in brown granulated sugar. It’s homey and comforting, favoring its floral and fruity side<em>. </em>This is a light, sweet whisky that sweeps around the mouth, radiating maltiness, apple, grapefruit, dried mango strips, and mingling spices. A studiously long finish of sucked caramel candy and beeswax follows. A smart choice for the beginning of the evening. £30",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Old Masters Freemason Whisky,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Originally created by Lombard for the Freemasons, this has a flavorsome nose of dark chocolate chip cookies, light spices, coconut macaroons, malt, and bright, fresh bananas. The palate is light and unobtrusive, with honey and malt reinforced by the spices running underneath. A shift develops to some later cocoa and chocolate notes, and the mocha finish fades gracefully. A finely balanced concoction, and you will rarely find this quality and flavor for the price",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Kilkerran Work in Progress 6 Sherry Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"The latest releases from Glengoyne distillery are 10 year olds, one matured in sherry wood and one in bourbon barrels, as was the case with release 5. 9,000 bottles are available globally. Initially savory on the nose, slightly earthy, with sherry, new leather, lemonade, and a hint of ozone. Spicy and zesty, with developing stewed fruits, dark chocolate, and deep sherry notes on the palate. The finish is long and persistently spicy, mildly smoky, with quite dry sherry notes.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
87,Craigellachie 17 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,132,"Golden, lifted, and aromatic. The fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there, but that little sulfur edge has now gone, revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. Now you find pineapple and light chalk. The flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily, along with a soft, vanilla ice cream plumpness. Sweet and full, and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. Muscly, but sweet; that’s the paradox of the Craigellachie character. £83",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
87,Gordon & MacPhail Cask Strength 1995 (distilled at Aberfeldy),,Single Malt Scotch,95,"This expression from Aberfeldy was distilled in April 1995 and bottled in January 2014 after maturation in refill, remade sherry hogsheads (casks #2,488, 2,489, and 2,491). The nose is floral, with ginger and developing milk chocolate. Progressively sweeter, with slight sherry and vanilla notes. The palate is silky and sweet, with banoffee pie, peaches, and spicy oak. The finish is long, with cocoa powder and more spiced oak. £60",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
87,Highland Queen 1561 30 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,302,"A limited edition blend with more than 75 percent malt content, containing grains from 1978 and 1979, and malts from 1982. A genteel nose exudes white chocolate, vanilla slice, butterscotch, fresh apricots, and salted pecans. Commanding and rich, it luxuriates in bitter orange, ripe apricots, marmalade, dairy toffees, cinnamon, and raspberry, with a finish of Seville orange rind. It’s a little blander with water, toward baked lemons and barley sugar, so resist and take it as it comes. £190",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Highland Journey,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,63,"This was inspired by Stewart Laing’s childhood journeys by steam locomotive from Glasgow to Speyside with his father. Hunter Laing’s blended malt includes contributions from Blair Athol, Teaninich, and Clynelish and raises toffee sauce, dried banana chips, and spring foliage, with a fringe of fresh mint. You can appreciate the cool, clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha, ginger, and chocolate mousse. Dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. All aboard! £40",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Haig Club,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,72,"A confectioner’s delight; Fry’s Five Centres, lime, lemon, kumquat, iced buns, fresh mint, and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. Those re-charred, rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. It has a gilded, satiny sheen, glistening with lemon drizzle cake, butterscotch, orange matchsticks, and banana bread. Incontrovertibly, it inhabits a signature grain style, but it fizzles out with a sticky, sweet aftertaste, like licking the spoon from the icing bowl. £45",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,Sovereign (distilled at Cameronbridge) 23 year old 1990,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,127,"Appearances can be deceptive, as this pallid specimen proves. Overripe honeydew melons, lemon cheesecake sprinkled with zest, vanilla pear muffins<em>, </em>cooked apple, spring blossoms, and icing sugar. The sweet, sugary opener is burnt out enjoyably by blistering burnt orange, butterscotch, and lemon bonbons. While the flavor intensity builds commendably, it doesn’t escape without a touch of astringency. Water makes this sing ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ but go easy with it. The finish is like a greedy mouthful of <em>tarte au citron</em>. £80",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
87,The Famous Grouse Double Matured 16 year old Vic Lee Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,99,"Just eight whiskies in the blend, married and finished in first fill Spanish sherry and bourbon casks. An insistent nose, crackling with spices, with toasted Eccles cake anointed with grated nutmeg, vanilla extract, cassia, and dark soy sauce. Light honey and vanilla, tangerine oils, and lime peel exhibit perfectly-paced development, with flavor building over a minute or more. Warming ginger, spices, and tropical fruits of guava and papaya close out this first annual special edition. Impressive work.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
87,Carn Mor (distilled at Ben Nevis) 1997,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,93,"This single cask 17 year old expression of Ben Nevis was matured in a sherry butt which yielded 747 bottles. It appears in Carn Mor’s “Strictly Limited” series of releases and has not been chill filtered. The bold nose opens with slightly savory notes and hard-boiled eggs. Sherry, malt, and figs subsequently develop. Quite full-bodied, with rich Jaffa orange and developing plain chocolate on the palate. More dark chocolate and a suggestion of fennel in the medium-length finish. £55",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
87,Caol Ila 2002 Feis Ile 2014 bottling,,Single Malt Scotch,167,"Restrained, ozonic, with no great smokiness to open, but there is a touch of green grass behind meadow flowers and salt-washed stones so typical of the distillery. With water another marker—drying fishing nets—comes through, with breaths of the sea. Subtle and refined. More smoke on the palate, where it’s like a flowering currant bush on fire. Great balance of different elements: smoke, fragrance, oil, acidity. With water, real saltiness comes through. Very good. £99",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
87,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1969 (Cask #2545),,Single Malt Scotch,,"This comes from a refill butt and has a light, paler color. The lack of huge oak interaction has given an amazing freshness; think of freshly-applied plaster, syrup, hot green bracken, a touch of nuttiness. It takes water well, allowing pure, soft fruits to come through, and it is these which become almost syrup-like in the mouth, while never losing Glenfarclas’ central depth and roasty richness in the center. £865",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
87,Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Longmorn) 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,135,"Longmorn always has this fruitcake thing going on and this is no exception. A sherry hoggie  helped provide sultana, cake mix, grilled almond, rhubarb puree, and a little cigar box. The palate is very fruity, with light Darjeeling-like tannins, then red fruits. It becomes nuttier as it moves and needs water to add ripeness to the stone fruit base. Highly recommended and extremely well priced. £80",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
87,Tomatin 1988 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,250,"This vintage expression from Tomatin has been matured in a mix of bourbon and port casks, and is being released in batches. The first comprises 2,500 bottles. The soft, fragrant nose offers strawberries, apricots, honey, and caramel, with a final hint of dry port. Fruit and caramel notes carry over from the nose onto the palate before dark chocolate appears, along with a suggestion of smoke. Subtle oak and ginger in the lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
87,Tomatin Cù Bòcan 1989 Limited Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,337,"Tomatin launched the peated Cù Bòcan expression last year, and follows it with a vintage variant, the result of “…a rare and unintentional production of peated whisky at the distillery on 7<sup>th</sup> June 1989.” Three bourbon casks yielded 1,080 bottles. Ripe apples and aerosol furniture polish, with a vanilla and sweet woodsmoke backdrop on the nose. Full-bodied, with intense, sweet fruit notes on the palate, and a heathery, smoky kick. Smoky spice and nutty flavors in the ultimately drying finish. £200",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
87,Kilchoman Coull Point,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,76,"This strikes me as being the most overtly smoky of Kilchoman’s recent bottlings, and also the sweetest. Intense and very forward, there’s baked apple, humidor notes, honeydew melon, fresh shellfish. Water brings out a putty-like youthfulness, so take it neat. The palate is amazingly sweet (think golden syrup), then the smoke folds itself over. A good—and well-priced—introduction for newcomers.<em>(World of Whiskies UK Travel Retail only) </em>£45",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
87,Clan Denny (distilled at Port Dundas) 1992 21 year old HH9452,,Single Grain Whisky,108,"There’s little quality Port Dundas being bottled, so don’t pass up the opportunity for this one. It evokes aromas of grated milk chocolate, grilled pancakes, apricot, mango, and poached pear Jell-O, with spice notes of ground cumin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This is simply delicious: a honey pot of sticky sweetness. A rich, cask strength grain whisky with notes of mandarin and candied jellies. A dash of water enables the sweet, creamy flavors to swirl around the mouth. £64",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
87,Exclusive Malts North Highland 17 year old 1996 Cask # 7025,,Single Malt Scotch,120,"From an undisclosed North Highland distillery, aged in a refill sherry hogshead. The impact of the sherry is clear, with ripe blackberry and peach. A floral, sweet, clover honey note rounds out a deliciously lush mouthfeel. This lushness is well balanced by a spicy mid-palate that features black pepper, ginger, and strong salinity that help provide some real depth. A long and slightly dry finish wraps up a solid whisky. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
87,Lord Elcho,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,43,"Lord Elcho was an 18th century ancestor of William Wemyss, who fought on Bonnie Prince Charlie’s side at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. With a minimum of 40% malt, this fine blend has a rather perfumed nose of fresh mint, green apple, sliced melon, and tropical fruits. The soft candy sugar and butterscotch palate builds, with layers of malt, cherry laces, gingerbread, and pfeffernüsse leading to a ginger and spice finish of significant length. Highly accomplished. £26",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
87,Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"A follow up to the original Jefferson’s Ocean, 62 barrels of mature bourbon spent 5 months at sea. Can I detect any noticeable sea influence? Not really—perhaps a hint of brine—but it’s nice, pleasant bourbon nonetheless with nothing out of place. Well rounded notes of layered sweetness (caramel, vanilla, maple syrup and a hit of sweet corn), honeyed orchard fruit, and spiced with cinnamon and evergreen. Soft, soothing finish. Sourced whiskey.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
87,Talisker Triple Matured Edition,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"This no age statement Talisker is one of the first “triple matured” (so-named) whiskies exclusive to Friends of The Classic Malts. Successive periods of aging occurred in refill casks, charred American oak hogsheads, and European oak refill casks. Ozone, fresh asphalt, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose. A big pepper hit in the mouth, backed by earthy peat, Elastoplast, vanilla, and citrus fruits. The pepper lasts right to the end in the long, steadily-drying, charcoal-fueled finish. £80",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
87,WhistlePig 10 year old Straight Rye,50.0,Rye Whiskey,67,"Regauged into once-used bourbon barrels, this is not the WhistlePig of old. Four years’ finishing in Vermont has toned down the sweetness and high notes, emphasizing a complex, leather/dark chocolate/tobacco spectrum instead. Lavender, violets, and ripe red fruit rise over dusty-dry barn boards, blue clay, and dark rye bread. The spicy rye tones glow with white pepper, while hints of astringent barrel oak keep a slight slipperiness from clinging.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
87,Overeem Sherry Matured,43.0,Australian Whisky,236,"This second, standard-strength version of Casey Overeem’s sherry pair bears toffee apple, cherry loaf, prune juice, and aged Aceto Balsamico Di Modena on the nose, adding a rewarding depth of flavor. It’s rich, full-bodied, and clings to the teeth like a mollusk to a rock during a storm over the South East Cape. A late-night dram of cherry flesh, Brazil nut, ground cinnamon, whole clove, and cacao that dissipates into a relaxing finish of well-worn leather and wax cherry lips. £140",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
87,Teeling Vintage Reserve Silver Bottling 21 year old,46.0,Irish,220,"This promises to be a bumper year for older Irish whiskey. This example from Cooley distillery is a 1991 distillation matured in bourbon casks, then finished in a Sauternes cask.Temptations exude from the glass with apricot frangipane, whole almond, and cloved orange. After a vinous opening, it evolves through a complex palate of white chocolate, honey, cocktail grapefruit, and dried banana chips. Plum skin and cinnamon spice seem in conflict with the sweetness, and somewhat disturb the harmony. £130",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
87,"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Kilchoman, Batch 1)",,Single Malt Scotch,117,"Startlingly herbal. Penetrating, lifted, and aromatic with dill, mint, and in time, celery leaf and lovage. Smoke is akin to freshly-laid tarmac with some sweet seaweed behind. Lively and quite different to the official bottling. Water brings unripe pineapple, clove, sugared almond, and horseradish. This has typical Kilchoman sweet creaminess in the center. Water brings out flavors of nettles, and saltiness. £69",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
87,Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Macduff) 2000,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,76,"Gordon &amp; MacPhail’s latest bottling from Macduff distillery is a year 2000 distillation, matured in refill sherry hogsheads. American cream soda and light spices on the nose, with honey, and white pepper development. Ultimately, rum and raisin fudge. Smooth and supple in the mouth, with apple peel, soft <i>fino</i> sherry, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length, with spicy fruit notes. £45",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
87,Tweeddale Single Lowland Malt 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,84,"This unspecified single malt has been bottled non-chill filtered in single cask format. Maturation took place in a barrel that formerly contained Islay single malt. Initially earthy on the nose, with potato skins, salt, and white pepper. Time in the glass teases out fruity, caramel sweetness. The palate is very sweet and zesty, with orange sherbet, along with a nicely integrated maritime note which becomes more pronounced. The finish is spicy and mildly medicinal. £50",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
87,BeanBall Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Label: “BeanBall Bourbon – Tennessee Straight Bourbon Whiskey.” Believed to be from Dickel, but no confirmation; just the huge cracked corn component in the nose, which should be all you need. My, that’s tasty as it spreads like warm oil over the tongue, hot corn spirit spiked hard with oak. Good oak, dried corn, and a snap of mint in the finish. Nice selection…and interesting labeling in light of the recent Tennessee whiskey definition squabbles. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
87,Coppersea Green Malt Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Made with green malt: not kilned, taken just as it’s ready from malting to be fermented and distilled, timing that accounts for some of the price and limited availability of this unique spirit. Smells like a shed full of drying herbs and flowers; vegetal souls transmigrated to the bottle. Herbal, European, restrained barrel character, headily vaporous in the mouth. An invigorating elixir I’d like to keep handy in a small flask; a little goes a long way. Fascinatingly different. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
87,Coppersea Raw Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Coppersea uses New York grain (75% rye, 25% malt), mashed in wooden tanks and distilled in direct-fire copper pot stills. This unaged spirit is highly aromatic: hay, sunny meadow, hints of lavender and tansy, honeydew melon. Brilliantly herbal flavors, sweet grass, gobs of white pepper, lemon balm, and a long-lingering sweet heat. Almost more like an <em>eau de vie</em> than a whiskey, with layer upon layer to discover. Heretical thought: this might be wasted on a barrel.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
87,Braunstein Edition No. 2,,Danish,922,"Brothers Claus and Michael Braunstein conceived the notion of making Danish whisky during fly-fishing trips to Scotland. Distilled on their combined column and pot still set, this peated whisky was disgorged from bourbon casks filled in 2007. Lime and Parma violets on the nose balance antiseptic and tea tree oil. Fizzy sherbet candy, lime, banana, and pineapple in the mouth, ending with a dry finish of Edinburgh rock. Fans of Islay’s south coast whiskies should try this one. 5,000kr",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
87,Cardhu 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,267,"There appears to be a concerted effort to bring this distillery out of the shadows: A Good Thing in my opinion. This limited

release is very Cardhu, with masses of mandarin, dried peach, and honey, reminiscent of a fine oxidized Chinese Phoenix Oolong tea, while still retaining the effervescent buzz of youth. Akin to a fine Cuban rum on the tongue, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry, and tangy, spicy life, it dies a little quickly, but is a lovely dram. £160",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
87,Auchentoshan Silveroak 1990,,Single Malt Scotch,145,"This is the second batch of Silveroak 1990 from Auchentoshan, and it has benefited from an extra year of maturation in bourbon and <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks. The 22 year old is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets. Notably floral on the nose, with fudge, banana, ginger, and attractive oak. On the palate it delivers vanilla, apricots, apples, more ginger, and oak. The finish is long and spicy, with dark coffee notes and a hint of menthol. Greater complexity than its predecessor.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
87,Wemyss Malts Toffee Glaze 1997 (distilled at Clynelish),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,68,"The latest Wemyss single cask release of Clynelish from the distillery at Brora in Sutherland runs to 258 bottles and has been matured in a hogshead. Freshly-sliced green apples on the nose, slightly peppery, with grated nutmeg and salted caramels. Relatively full-bodied, with lots of soft fruit, principally Jaffa oranges, and sweet spice. Spicy caramel and cocoa powder in the slowly drying, medium-length finish. £75",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
87,Wemyss Malts Brandy Casket (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1989,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Wemyss Malts has bottled this 23 year old hogshead-matured example of Glen Garioch from the Aberdeenshire village of Oldmeldrum. Just 322 bottles were yielded by the cask. Cigarette tobacco, brittle toffee, and a hint of aniseed on the nose. Vanilla develops, along with strawberries, apples, and pears. Rich malt, walnuts, cooked apple, and cinnamon on the palate. The spicy finish features old leather and pepper. £105<b> </b>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
87,The Whisky Exchange (distilled at Linkwood) 16 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,108,"The combination of Linkwood and sherry cask can be to the detriment of such a perfumed whisky. Not here. The nose speaks of caramel toffee, demerara sugar, and while an oaky touch is there it’s light, allowing plump sultanas, rose, and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. The palate is relaxed and gentle, with darker fruits. There’s sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. It needs water to reach ideal balance. Lovely. £65",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
87,Pentland Skerries,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Maturation of the Pentland Skerries bottling of the Lighthouse Collection has taken place exclusively in former Spanish sherry casks, which lends the nose rich, dark sherry and Christmas cake notes, caramel and old leather, along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness, which here comes across as salted peanuts. Full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. £55/liter",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
87,Port Ellen 34 year old,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,2000,"Here’s a classical Port Ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of Spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? <i>(2,958 bottles).</i>",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
87,Copper House Triple Grain No. 2,43.0,English Grain Spirit,73,"This is one of the first two releases from Copper House, a distillery contained within the Adnams brewery at Southwold on the east coast of England. If you know Adnams’ beers, it will come as no surprise that it&#039;s breaking new ground by creating a whisky with a mashbill of wheat, oats, and barley. This is only 3 years old but a soft toffee creaminess, chocolate orange, oak, and pepper ensure a delightful and surprisingly full whisky. £44",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
87,Compass Box Great King Street Experimental OO-V4,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,48,"Great King Street was our Blend of the Year two years ago and Compass Box wondered where to take it next. So they have released two versions, asking customers to decide between them by voting online. The other one is peated and will probably win easily, which is a shame, because this is a more subtle and better whisky. Sherry, syrup, honey, apple, and sultanas are all here, but nuanced. Delightful. £30",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
87,Wild Turkey Forgiven,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"An accidental “mingling” of rye whiskey with bourbon, resulting in a product that acts like bourbon with an unusually high percentage of rye in the mashbill. It shows, with vibrant notes of warming cinnamon, fresh mint, nutmeg, licorice root, and a hint of tellicherry pepper. All this is soothed by vanilla, caramel, and subtle honeyed citrus. Lively, distinctive, and versatile.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
87,"That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Aberfeldy, Batch 1)",47.0,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Independent releases of the Perthshire single malt Aberfeldy are relatively rare, and the first batch of That Boutique-y Whisky Company’s no age statement Aberfeldy runs to 155 numbered bottles. The nose features coconut ice, vanilla, malt, candied peel, and ginger. Good mouthfeel, with more malt, ginger-nut biscuits, icing sugar, and milk chocolate. The finish is drying, with oak and black pepper. £65/500 ml",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
87,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 22 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,156,"With no great wood on show, this is a Caol Ila which is time—not oak—driven. A very scented, nay herbal start, like bouquet garni with light smoke, grapefruit, sea-washed stones, ozone, and heather blossom. The retention of aromatics is gorgeous. Water increases the peat effect but diminishes the aromatics, so take your choice. Well worth a look.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
87,Douglas Laing Old Particular 21 year old (distilled at Glen Scotia),,Single Malt Scotch,137,"Whiskies in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths, with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. This Glen Scotia was distilled in May 1992 and boasts a nose of violets, musky malt, soft smoke, and a fresh sea breeze. Big, spicy, and quite oily on the palate, with dark berries, black tea, and a note of tar. Long and dark in the finish, with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
87,Glencadam 30 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,451,"This is a single cask (#729) bottling, distilled in 1982, and the outturn was just 260 bottles. Soft and supple on the waxy nose, with worn leather, Jaffa oranges, and malt. Lots of leather, with brittle toffee, orange creams, and a slightly musty note on the full palate. Mouth-drying in the lengthy finish, but the tannins never come close to overwhelming. £280",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
87,Glenfiddich Vintage Cask,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,111,"One of a trio of new whiskies that have spent time in Glenfiddich’s new solera vats, this will surprise many because of its overt smokiness that’s like a bonfire in a pear orchard. Some ferny greenness adds to the freshness. The reverse happens on the palate, with the smoke being held in check by the soft mouthfeel (which could be solera-enhanced), ripe fruits, and gentle creaminess.<i> (Travel Retail; Asia only, currently.)</i>£70",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
87,Kilchoman 100% Islay 3rd Edition,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,92,"Here you have the sweetness of rising bread alongside scallop and wreathes of smoke, all lit by west coast sunshine; the peat isn’t dank, but bright and flaming. The palate is sweetly seductive before the smoke begins to come through, then it sweetens like golden syrup, then the shore comes back, and so it continues. Water ups the impact of each, so be careful, as it can then seem disconnected. Sweet, beachy, smoky. Very Islay.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
87,Adelphi (distilled at Glen Moray) 27 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,158,"Each independent bottler has its own signature style. Adelphi’s is about relaxed, contemplative drams with rich maturity and a certain seriousness. Here you see this, plus crème brûlée, sitting in front of a sandalwood backdrop with a bunch of basil mint thrown in. The opening is slow, and while the inherent sweet nature of the distillery is there, hazelnuttish oak helps to add structure and stops any flabbiness from intruding. A luscious dram. £99",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
87,St. George's Royal Baby,50.0,Single Malt English Whisky,130,"Another Royal occasion, another excuse for a new bottling, but this one justifies its existence because it brings tropical fruit and spice to the English whisky party. The nose is nothing to get excited about, but there's rich pureed pear and some orange peel on the palate, melon sweetness, and cloves and cinnamon. It wraps up with some pleasant rustic earthiness. £80",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
87,Masterson’s 12 year old Straight Wheat Whiskey,50.0,Canadian,79,"Canadian whisky makers tend to mash their grains separately, then blend them as mature spirits, allowing the individual grains to shine. This all-wheat whiskey was matured in used barrels, further accentuating these grain flavors. Sweet and light on the nose, the palate overflows with toffee and vanilla. Then, a vaguely earthy dryness follows glowing white pepper. Robust without the weight of corn, this luscious sipping whiskey provides guiltless pleasure with oodles of butterscotch custard, orange soda, and tingling spices.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
87,Miyagikyo 1999 single cask,61.0,Japanese,228,"Herbal-style Miyagikyo, with light balsa wood opening into macaroon and peach stone. The sense, especially with water, is of early autumn unfolding. The palate is very soft, with the assured boldness of character typical of the distillery, but tempered with a subtle undertow of persimmon and peach. Sweet and lush, but with delicacy. €169",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
87,Port Charlotte Scottish Barley,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Smoky, yes, but the effect is more shore-like: on the beach, hot sand, wood smoke, and a faint hint of balloons…there must be a party going on. In addition you get olive oil, preserved lemon, and eucalyptus. The palate is thick with strawberry sweeties that push back against the peat. Water calms things (suggesting this would work with soda), while the finish sees the campfire emit more smoke. £45",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
87,Douglas Laing Director’s Cut (distilled at Tomatin) 45 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,353,"This veteran example of Tomatin was distilled in November 1967 and matured for 45 years in refill butt #9315. The outturn was

175 bottles. Uncompromising dark sherry and treacle notes on the fruity nose, along with gunpowder tea. Big, old sherry notes on the full palate, with raisins, sultanas, and a sprinkling of black pepper. Fruity, notably spicy, and not too drying for its age in a relatively supple finish. £230",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
87,Wemyss Malts Ginger Spice (distilled at Glenrothes) 1988,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,164,"Glenrothes always has a spicy element, but this example ups the ante considerably and, true to the label, it’s fresh-cut ginger root alongside galangal and coriander, a hint of green grass, and even a little bite of jelly babies, alongside black currant leaf. Rothes’ normally languid air is here frothily exuberant, with just sufficient vanilla thickness to offer a brake. Uplifting and good. £107",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
87,Wemyss Malts Heathery Smoke (distilled at Caol Ila) 30 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,230,"Sweet oak and cod liver oil are what greet you, with fleshy, lychee-like fruits

behind. The smoke here is very polite, giving way to fruit jelly cubes and

peaches, to develop alongside crisp apple. The palate is clean with nutty oak, with

the smoke continuing in the background, offering an extra layer of complexity.

Fresh, belying its age, while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains

understated. Caol Ila basking in the summer sun.<em> (U.S. only)</em>",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
87,Kilkerran Work in Progress 5 Sherry,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,58,"Having released four previous “work in progress” expressions of Kilkerran, 2013 sees the launch of two editions, one matured in sherry casks and the other in bourbon barrels. The sherry-aged variant yields overripe green grapes and figs on the nose, followed by honey and plain chocolate, while the palate is quite full, softly fruity, with soft toffee and a hint of brine. The finish dries significantly, with cocoa powder, licorice, and lots of spice. £38",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
87,Alberta Springs 10 year old,40.0,Canadian,24,"Skilled whisky makers know many different ways to achieve a particular flavor profile. So when someone mentions rye, don’t ask the percentage, ask how it was made. Why? Because sometimes Alberta Springs is made entirely from rye grain, and sometimes it isn’t. And not even trained tasters can tell. Crisp yet silky with skillfully integrated rye spices riding waves of white pepper. Fruity, sweet vanilla, citrus zest, flaxseed, and dusty rye delivered in fresh-cut lumber<i>. (Canada only) </i>C$24",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
87,Gibson’s Finest 12 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"Until it arrived in U.S. stores earlier this year, Gibson’s 12 year old was highly prized by American cross-border whisky shoppers. They made it a duty free staple and no wonder. This is classic, old-style Canadian whisky. Seamlessly integrated spicy white pepper, refreshing bitterness, and succulent butterscotch, all burnished with clean oak, cinnamon, cloves, and simmering ginger. It has the creamy body of crème brûlée brightened by a sprinkling of blackstrap molasses. C$22",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
87,Hankey Bannister Heritage Blend,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,42,"Hankey Bannister includes some stunning aged whiskies in its range, but given the trend toward unaged scotch releases, I was a bit suspicious of this. It lacks depth but nevertheless is a butterfly in a breeze of a whisky; gossamer light, both tantalizing and elusive. It’s liquid honey, with sweet lime and pear, some cocoa, and to give it a modicum of depth, it’s underpinned

by a light saltiness.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
87,Belle Meade,,Craft Whiskey,39,"This one’s calling to me; I can smell the rich nose from a foot away. Freshly-sieved cornmeal, sharp oak aromas, and spice cake in the nose. Good body, a bit warm (expected from the proof), and a mouthful of

cracked corn, piecrust, sun-warmed meadow-mint, and vanilla. Finish is firm and leaner than the mouth, drawn out nicely. Belle Meade is currently sourced from MGP; Green Brier hopes to have their distillery up this year.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
87,Yellow Rose Straight Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Sweet, warm, grassy, like a sunny day on the prairie. The alcohol heat quickly yields to a grass/mint sweetness—this is high-rye stuff—that picks up some oily rye notes as it slides into a finish that is both bitter and sweet without being bittersweet; the components remain discrete, not blending. Quite nice, and reasonably priced. Sourced whiskey (with the 95&#37; rye mashbill that’s an LDI/MGP signature).",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
87,Heartwood Vat Out of Hell,,Australian Whisky,,"You don’t want to argue with this, sport, or it’ll deck you. Look at the strength, for a starter. But this is Australian whisky going off into a whole new direction, and not taking prisoners on the way. It’s

Lark whisky mixed with another Tasmanian one so you get the big clove and nutmeg, apple core, and fermenting fruit notes, but with honey and peat in the mix. Love it, loathe it, but you can’t ignore it. A$190",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
87,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Hot Box Toasted Barrel,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"The oak staves are placed in a “hot box” at 133 degrees and then steamed before being built up into a barrel. Aged over 16 years, this is pleasant whiskey (if not overly complex), with caramel, tropical fruit, marzipan, a hint of toasted coconut, and a nice creamy texture. My favorite of the two experimental releases. Price is per 375ml.",John Hansell,Summer 2013
87,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Clynelish) 1997,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 15 year old bottling of Diageo’s Sutherland single malt comes courtesy of The Creative Whisky Co., whose Exclusive Malts range of single cask, cask strength Scotch malt whiskies has recently been imported into the U.S. Fleeting burnt sugar on the nose, then mango and brittle toffee. Vanilla emerges, with slightly smoky malt. Finally, cloves. Mouth-coating, with lively spices, fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate. Relatively long in the finish, with ginger snaps and a wax-like texture.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
87,The Dalmore Valour,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"The Dalmore has added a new expression to its Travel Retail portfolio, namely Valour. This variant carries no age statement and maturation began in first-fill bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts before undergoing a finishing period in port pipes. The result is a nose of black currants, caramel, and musty sherry. The palate is medium-sweet, with damsons, Jaffa oranges, and printer’s ink. Dark berries emerge in time. The finish embraces drying spices, figs, and mildly astringent oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
87,Glen Elgin 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The least well-known of the Fogwatt trio which includes Longmorn and BenRiach, it’s unlikely that Glen Elgin will become a major brand anytime soon, given how important it is to blenders. A combination of long, slow ferments, and distillation coupled with worm tubs gives a ludicrously fruity spirit, which here is bulging with ripe peach, apricot, and Galia melon coated in cinnamon and nutmeg, given thick weight by the worm tubs. A classic. £34",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
87,Highland Park Loki 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Following on from Thor, Loki is the second release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. Loki has been matured in a mix of sherry and heavily-peated casks. Initial notes of marzipan on the nose, then orange, oriental spices, and chili. In time, yellow plums, vanilla, and floral notes. Soft and sweet on the palate, with pink grapefruit, overt smoke, and a touch of salt. The finish features contrasting barbecue and vanilla notes, citrus, and lots of spice.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
87,Kavalan Sherry Oak,46.0,Taiwanese Whisky,,"Two out of three ain't bad. While Kavalan doesn't quite pull off the hat trick, this is no album filler either (can we still say that?). It is Karaoke Kavalan, Taiwanese X Factor whisky: a perfect reproduction of a big, plummy, pruney, tannin-soaked rich fruit compote with late fall damp forest notes. It says a lot about this distillery that five years ago we'd have marveled at this. Today, and by its own standards, it's Kavalan doing an Aerosmith ballad.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
87,Bulleit Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Soft, elegant, and nicely rounded, with honeyed orchard fruit and gentle spice on a bed of vanilla and caramel. Very versatile; a pleasing, unchallenging bourbon to suit most moods and situations. I actually like it better than the new, older 10 year old expression (reviewed in this issue), because it is so beautifully balanced. ",John Hansell,Summer 2013
87,Dry Fly Cask Strength Wheat,60.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Not burning my nose; mild bread and vanilla aromas. Peppy stuff, but not explosive on the palate; easily held five seconds on the tongue, but fiery once it gets aerated. Sweet grain with a big saw-toothed edge of cinnamon and hot vanilla, and a circling brim of zingy mint that tightens toward the finish. Pretty interesting stuff for wheat whiskey; a more expressive nose would seal the deal. Price is per 375ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
87,Santis Malt Edition Germany,48.0,Swiss,,"This is whisky made in a European style; don't expect scotch. Reset your taste buds, free your mind. This is 6 years old and spent five and a half of them in a beer barrel—the whisky is made from an award winning beer—and six months in a Merlot wine cask. It's fabulous. Honeycomb, creamy toffee caramel, European sappiness. It's slightly flabby, like an overfed but much-loved puppy. €35  ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
87,St. George Single Malt,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"After twelve years, it’s time for a revisit. No age statement; aged in a variety of woods. The whiskey is a pale gold and has a pleasantly sweet and layered nose; honeycomb, dried apricot, sugar cookies, and hints of an ice wine richness. It’s a bit hot for 43%, which robs the palate of some complexity, but that honeyed fruit and cookie is there in the mouth, too. Overall, quite nice indeed. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
87,Wild Geese Classic Blend,43.0,Irish,,"The Wild Geese whiskeys offer much, but seem to lack the conviction to strike out and be bold. Ironically, though this is the one you'd expect to play safest of all, in fact, it's the most interesting of the bunch. There are trademark apple notes, but it flip-flops appealingly. It has a creamy and toffee-ish heart, is full, soft, and sweet, and has some orange fruit, apricot, and peach notes. Not unlike a classy Canadian whisky. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
87,Limeburners Single Malt M79,61.0,Australian Whisky,,"Nobody hollers louder than an Aussie when he wants to. This malt is matured in 100-liter American oak casks and finished in port barrels, just as Cask M76 is (also reviewed this issue), but if M76 is about pub rock, this is Wolfmother, a hard-hitting, rich, forceful but complex wave of loveliness, with fig and date to the fore, baked peach, and crystallized brown sugar. It's creamy, rich, mouth coating, and there's some menthol cough drop in there for good measure. A$130",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
87,Arran Premium Bourbon Single Cask (Cask 2096),52.0,Single Malt Scotch,130,"This U.S.-exclusive Premium Bourbon Single cask #2096 contrasts nicely with its sherry cask-matured sibling, and offers vanilla, cocoa powder, malt extract, ripe bananas, and spicy sultanas on the nose. The palate is smooth and spicy, with ginger snaps and developing butteriness. The finish is medium to long, with chili notes and citrus fruits at the last. ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
87,Arran Orkney Bere,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"The ancient variety of barley known as bere that was used to make this Arran single malt was grown on Orkney and distilled in 2004. It was matured for eight years in bourbon barrels, and 5,800 bottles have been released. Very fruity on the nose, principally peaches, with vanilla and fudge, something slightly herbal, wet grass, and finally homemade lemonade. Oily mouthfeel, with fresh oak, cloves, and wild berries. An atypical Arran! The finish is drying and moreish. £48",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
87,Bunnahabhain 40 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Here’s an Islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. Hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. It has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature whiskies, manifested here as mulberry vinegar. The mouth has coconut, some grip, and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. Take with water on the side. £1,999",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
87,Glenfiddich Over 38 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Surprisingly pale (you see the issue, Macallan?), but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. The palate is subtle and soft with light heat, toasted chocolate, white currant, and then overwhelming cherry blossom. Exotic is the word. Bottled for China, but may be given a wider release. £3,000",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
87,Springbank Calvados Wood 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This expression from the Campbeltown distillery of Springbank was distilled in April 2000, matured for six years in refill bourbon barrels, and then for another six years in Calvados casks. The outturn was 9,420 bottles. Toffee apples dipped in soft spices on the nose, with a follow through of vanilla. Quite viscous on the palate, with white wine, red peppers, and cinnamon, along with a tang of peat. Lime marmalade and a touch more peat in the relatively dry finish.  ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
87,High West Campfire Barrel Finish,46.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"A blend of bourbon, rye, and peated single malt Scotch whiskies. This is an adaptation of the original release that spent additional time in Hungarian and French oak barrels. The finishing produces a creamier, smoother, more rounded, more mature, and improved version of Campfire, showing notes of honey, vanilla, dark berries, soft mint, and smoke. Distinctive and unique.",John Hansell,Spring 2013
87,Penderyn Portwood 41,41.0,Welsh Whisky,,"A distillery-only bottling last year, and I'm delighted it's now more widely available. Penderyn is as brash about portwood as the Aussies, and this has a rich, creamy, and sweet liqueur-like taste, with blackcurrant to the fore. It's a delight. Penderyn is bottled in batches, so this is a different version from last year’s, but it's close. I called it fruit compote in a glass. £36",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
87,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Blair Athol) Autumn Berries,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Distilled in 1986, this single cask from Blair Athol distillery in Perthshire yielded 268 bottles, and the nose offers sweet fruits, principally apple and orange, plus walnuts, vanilla, and brittle toffee. Becoming softer and creamier with time. Dark fruit notes on the palate, notably blackcurrants and cranberries, with caramel and cinnamon. The finish is quite viscous, with a little oak, freshly-squeezed lemons, and licorice twists. £85 ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
87,Adelphi Breath of Islay 13 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The latest bottling of “Breath” is like a whisky smuggler’s tale. There’s the smell of old waxed walking boots, wet moss, damp earth, crushed bog foliage — heather, bog myrtle — burlap sacking, and a hastily smothered fire. The smoke is well controlled all the way, which helps to allow its scents to run over bitter coffee and a balancing central sweetness. Robust, hairy, and uncompromising, this is less of a breath and more of a roar. £65 ",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
87,Wiser’s Small Batch,,Canadian,33,"With Small Batch, Wiser’s offers a taste of the quality of its more expensive Legacy to those with a limited whisky budget. This is big whisky at a very affordable price. Cinnamon, cloves, and candied ginger temper glowing hot pepper, while oak caramels and vanilla bolster sweet dark fruit. The earthiness of rye intersects with the fragrance of river plants and wet slate. Red cedar and fresh sawdust round out a clean, expressive palate. Lots of weight. C$33",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
87,Compass Box The Entertainer,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"This is a special bottling for London department store Selfridge's, but it represents a clever strategy by artisan Compass Box to set its own agenda by regionalizing its whiskies. This is a long way from the New York blend—indeed, creamier and sweeter than other recent releases. It has a honey heart, traces of cinnamon, and menthol in the mix, plus wispy smoke. There's some spice and peat late on, but in relatively subdued form. Very pleasant. £85",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
87,Balblair 1975 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Balblair has followed up the first release of its 1975 vintage bottling with a second, which differs significantly in character, having been matured in American oak sherry casks, whereas the initial release had been aged in Spanish oak sherry casks. Floral, mellow, and slightly oily on the nose, with a savory background and ready-salted crisps. Silky smooth on the palate, with citrus fruit, a hint of wood smoke, coconut, and honey. The finish is spicy, with aniseed and oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
87,Glen Scotia 16 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,88,"The nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge, then black pepper, sea salt, and a savory note develops. The palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. Slightly tarry in the finish. Macho!",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
87,St. George's Classic Malt,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"This is set to be the first proper release into the American market, and it's a good introduction point, with all the distillery characteristics on display and a delightful rustic peat base to set it all off. On the nose there is trademark sweet citrus and cracked pepper, though they're joined here by milk chocolate and creamed lime, and on the palate there's sweet lemon and lime sherbet, fruit cordial, and peat. £50",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
87,Yamazaki Puncheon,48.0,Japanese,112,"Yamazaki’s puncheons contain 480 liters and are made at the distillery’s cooperage from American white oak. The greater size means there are lower levels of oak extract, immediately apparent in the paler hue and more restrained aromas, where flowers mix with the gentle blandness of pear, lychee and, with water, pineapple. Best neat, here is distillery character (or one of the distillery characters, Yamazaki makes many styles) to the fore. Less immediate than the bourbon barrel, but ultimately more rewarding. £70",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
87,Glen Garioch Vintage 1995,,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of two new Glen Garioch vintages to be produced under the auspices of Morrison Bowmore Distillers’ master blender Rachel Barrie, this 1995 offering is due to appear in the U.S. next year. 1,000 cases are available and maturation has taken place in first-fill bourbon casks. Spice, vanilla, pears, honey, and very discreet smoke on the nose. Hazelnuts, baked bananas, apple strudel, and lots of spice on the sweet creamy palate, backed up by a gentle note of lingering char. £55",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
87,Glenrothes 1978,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Though this has been on the shelves in the UK for a while, its U.S. release has been delayed. It shows a classic mature ‘Rothes nose, mixing moist fruitcake, vanilla, and a tickle of maltiness. What sets this apart is the weight of the stewed fruit and a dry note reminiscent of light rain on tweed. The palate is typically slow with a sparky spiciness and a lick of hazelnut butter to caress your throat. Worth the wait. ",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
87,The Macallan Diamond Jubilee,52.0,Single Malt Scotch,549,"A vatting of sherry casks from (apparently) royally significant dates with an outturn of 2012 (get it?) bottles. Auburn in color, it has a fruit compote nose mixed with citrus, and a little hint of gravy browning in the background. This mix of the exotic—oil of clove on the tongue, the sweet and light grip—makes for a very intriguing, concentrated, and layered palate. Think of Turkish Delight and crystallized ginger. Try the distillery shop for stock. £350",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
87,Talisker 30 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"As part of a rebranding of the entire Talisker range, Diageo has brought its Special Releases 25 and 30 year old cask strength expressions into the full-time fold, reduced in strength to 45.8%. Sweet and buttery on the nose; soft fruits and fragrant malt, milk chocolate, and dry, crumbling peat. Citrus fruits (notably lemon), licorice sticks, black pepper, and scorched wood on the palate. Dry and oaky in the lengthy finish, with peat notes and allspice to the end. £300 ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
87,Wemyss “A Matter of Smoke” 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Peat smoke indeed, and it dovetails nicely with light toffee, vanilla, anise, charred oak, blackberry, seaweed, kalamata olive, brine, and peppercorn. Well balanced from start to lingering smoke finish, and very exciting. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",John Hansell,Fall 2012
87,Kilkerran Work in Progress 4 (2012 Release),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of releases of whisky distilled at the Campbeltown distillery of Glengyle, and now aged 8 years. Just 9,000 bottles are available. The nose is full, with over-ripe oranges, warm honey, and custard. On the palate, the oranges are fresher and livelier, with vanilla, hard toffee, and a slightly citric fruit edge to balance the sweetness. That sweetness carries over into the spicy finish, which is quite lengthy, with a lick of licorice. £35",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
87,John J. Bowman Single Barrel,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Triple distilled. (Twice in Kentucky, once in Virginia.) Gritty and gripping on the palate, showing dry, vibrant oak spice (particularly warming cinnamon and mouth-coating vanilla), but with candied fruit, toffee, pot still rum, and caramel-coated nuts to keep it interesting. Polished leather and tobacco on the finish. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",John Hansell,Fall 2012
87,New Zealand Dunedin Doublewood,44.0,New Zealand,,"What a surprise this is! After a steady run of aged and just about agreeable dusty lemon and paprika malts, this is the youngest release—just 8 years old—from the now-demolished Wilson distillery. At a guess I'd say the original whisky was ordinary, so the Tasmanians who own the stock did what Tasmanians do and finished it in port casks to make it fruity. The blemishes aren't entirely ironed out but the whisky gets away with it—and this is rather good, and at a better strength. Why bottle premium malt at 40% and your 8 year old at 44%? NZ$79",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
87,Bernheim Original Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Wheat,45.0,Wheat Whiskey,35,"This is a rare single barrel, non-chill filtered release. Straight wheat whiskeys can be almost too easy-going. Not chill-filtering adds teasing, subtle complexity. Gently sweet, with maple syrup, caramel, marzipan, and coconut cream, along with a dusting of vanilla, cinnamon, and green tea. A whiskey for a lazy Saturday afternoon...or perhaps with pancakes at brunch? (<em>Julio’s Liquors exclusive</em>)",John Hansell,Summer 2012
87,Arran The Eagle 1999,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,66,"The latest limited release in the Icons of Arran series was distilled in 1999 and matured in fourteen ex-bourbon barrels and seven sherry hogsheads. Initially launched in the UK, but global availability is anticipated. A sprinkling of coconut, vanilla, and spices, with pears, melons, and pineapple on the nose. Full and fruity on the palate, becoming maltier and nuttier. Sweet spices, especially stem ginger, and a hint of honey. Drying slowly in the very spicy finish (6,000 bottles). £42",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
87,Cragganmore 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This oft-overlooked Speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past, but now seems to have hit greater consistency. Worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt, but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. There are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf, hawthorn berries, and lots of honey. A chestnut note continues on the tongue where, on the finish, a hint of smoke lurks. ",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
87,Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1992,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Equally honeyed; in fact here the finish (oloroso this time) seems to enhance the sweetness. Out comes Manuka honey, Greek yogurt, and heavy blossom notes while the sherry itself brings in a nutty, polished note. There’s just a hint of sulfur when you add water (Dalwhinnie is a sulfury new make). The finish is long with some Brazil nut. Try frozen with dessert.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
87,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1981 (Cask #57),,Single Malt Scotch,386,"This is a refill (or in &#039;Farclas terms, ‘plain’) hogshead, so there is less wood on show and more distillery. The nose is like a gentleman’s club at lunchtime: roasting meat, some pipe tobacco, polished wood, and the scent of a freshly-dug garden wafting through the windows. The palate shows slightly more fresh fruitiness (in line with the 1971 cask). There’s decent grip; think treacle this time. Fluxes and changes, which makes it all the more intriguing. £246",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
87,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1984 (Cask #6030),51.0,Single Malt Scotch,392,"A refill hogshead this time, which when combined with its (relative) youth throws the distillery character into even greater focus. Positively light to start with, a green edge to the dry grass seen in the 1970s and more of the fruity notes hinted at in the 1982. All the time, though, it is anchored by meaty earthiness and that distinctive burnt note. The finish is a little short, but all in all a very appetizing example. £250",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
87,Chieftain’s (distilled at Glenturret) 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A comparatively rare independent bottling of what is, in any case, a hard to find single malt. Distilled in 1990, matured in an American oak hogshead (#646), and bottled at cask strength. White pepper, damp earth, violets, cinnamon, and slight saltiness on the nose. The pepper blackens on the idiosyncratic palate, with cough syrup, big spice notes, and dark berries. Long and peppery in the finish, with developing oak tannins.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
87,Writers Tears Pot Still Irish Whiskey,40.0,Irish,,"Like the Writers Tears reviewed in this issue, this is from an independent company linked to renowned whiskey maker Bernard Walsh. It is described as of a style popular in James Joyce's Dublin (hence the name). Grain whiskey was a no-no at that time, so this uses no grain and is a mix of malt and pot still whiskeys. For its price and strength it is amazing — a big-hearted and full-flavored whiskey with an oily, apple-y pot still heart and cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper spices. €38",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
87,Compass Box Last Vatted Grain,46.0,Grain Scotch Whisky,,"Bottled as London's Big Ben began to strike midnight on the day that the word 'vatted' was outlawed in Scotch whisky terminology, this is a mix of grains from different distilleries and does the campaign for more Scotch grain whisky no harm at all.  Gossamer soft and smooth with a honeycomb heart and milk chocolate, vanilla, and the odd prod of spice, it's a cushion of a whisky. Luxurious, indulgent, and well made. £125 ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
87,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection “Aged Cask” 46.2%,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"A set of two 100&#37; rye whiskeys, triple distilled in copper pot stills, with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask, while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.

Very pale in color, showing the limited oak influence. The used cask allows the rye to shine. An uncluttered whiskey, with fresh mint, soft cinnamon, creamy vanilla, hay, cut grass, and honeyed orchard fruit (green apple, pear, peach). Grassy finish. The more elegant of the two.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
87,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) Rare Auld Range 1987 vintage 24 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,135,"Full gold in color, this Bunna initially has the lifted Moscatel aroma that’s reminiscent of a fine Darjeeling leaf tea, then comes melting milk chocolate and touches of sweet cinnamon toast. The palate continues in this sweet vein, but has the distillery’s characteristic thickness in the mid-palate, as well as plenty of its signature fresh ginger note. With water, there are some baked fruits and a hint of flowers. Altogether delicious and subtly complex.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
87,Glenglassaugh Aged Over 30 Years,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This malt is actually 36 years old, having spent its first 34 years in a refill hogshead before two years of maturation in a first fill ex-Sauternes cask. The out-turn was 280 bottles. Mellow on the nose, with fresh oranges and apples, developing toffee, and violets. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with dark chocolate, pepper, and discreet tannins. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. £400",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
87,Penderyn Portwood,41.0,Welsh Whisky,,"At present this is a distillery-only bottling, but we need to start a campaign to get it on general release, because it is a modestly-priced gem of a malt whisky. This is fruit compote in a glass, with blueberry, blackberry, rose petal talcum powder, and redcurrant on the nose, and strawberry jam and summer fruit cordial on the palate. It's a palate cleanser, all soft, fresh, and fruity. Summer's arrived early. £30",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
87,"Kilchoman 100% Islay (distilled 2008, bottled 2011)",50.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The only Islay distillery not on the coast — and the most westerly on the island — Kilchoman is reviving the tradition of farm distilling, and this limited edition release uses locally grown Optic barley malted at the distillery. Very creamy, with some stewed apple, green banana, and (when diluted) sponge cake mix. The smoke develops on the palate, adding an earthy note. Rich, with some clove and licorice on the finish. Well worth a look. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
87,St. George's Founder's Reserve Cask 0005,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"You'll struggle to find this, as it has been snapped up quickly, but if you can, don't miss out. This whisky was originally made by Iain Henderson, is bottled at 5 years old, and marks a significant step forward for this fledgling distillery. The sappy notes have retreated and are being replaced by a wonderful sweet lemon and creamy vanilla whisky. The pinprick pepper adds a delightful dimension. £65 ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
87,John Jacôb Handmade Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"This 100% rye whiskey was distilled at Fremont Mischief, and aged in oak. The flinty-minty rye spice blows right out at you, with a ripple of oaky vanilla. Beautiful youthful rye spirit, with crackling rye spiciness, sweet floral notes, and hints of horehound candy. The finish is a bit disappointing — fading somewhat quickly — but mainly because the rest of it's so good. Great price for mellowness in this category, too.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
87,Forty Creek John's Private Cask No. 1,40.0,Canadian,,"Burnt sugar, wet raisins, oakspice, and a deep, underlying grain character. Flavors are wonderfully integrated: corn, malt, mellow syrup, hints of ripe plum and grape, wrapped in a light confection. Finish is light, warm, and lingering. Forty Creek releases a limited edition whisky every fall; this one focuses on grains rather than wood, according to distiller John Hall. Canadian distribution only.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2011
87,Adelphi (distilled at Glen Grant) 1985 25 year old,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Old gold in color. Obviously an old whisky, but a delicate one that has subtle complexities; the balance between the dried grass/hayloft, the dried orange peel, and stewed apple, for example. Sweet and fragrant, it shows chypre notes with water alongside a more gentle floral aspect. The palate is drier than the nose suggests, quite mineral, with a lacy character. The finish shows melon and mint. Glen Grant in gentle repose.£88",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
87,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Pulteney) 21 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Gordon & MacPhail bottled a 21 year old expression from Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery for the U.S. market earlier this year. Sweet on the nose, with honey and vanilla; fleetingly, stewed apricots and peaches, plus a hint of caramel. Intensely focused, sweet tropical fruits on the palate, with barley sugar. Becoming nuttier, with an edge of mixed spices. Spice fading to milk chocolate in the medium-length finish, with just a suggestion of brine. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
87,Ardmore Traditional Cask 1998,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A single cask of Ardmore aged in a first-fill bourbon cask and then finished in quarter casks. This one is more mature, with more depth than the standard Ardmore Traditional Cask (which I rated 80 a few years back). Notes of toffee, vanilla bean, chocolate fudge, licorice stick, bourbon, tar, charcoal, and a hint of burnt raisin. Very nice! (A Julio’s Liquors Exclusive.) ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
87,Auchentoshan Bourbon Matured 1975,,Single Malt Scotch,750,"The latest triple distilled bottling from the Lowland distillery of Auchentoshan has been matured for 35 years in bourbon casks and is presented non-chill filtered and at cask strength. Just 500 bottles are available globally. Apple crumble and custard on the nose, with developing cereal notes. Smooth and enticing. Spice, fresh fruits, honey, and marzipan on the buttery palate, which ultimately becomes drier. The finish is long and discreetly drying, with spices, malted barley, and a citrus tang in the tail. Price is approximate.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
87,Edradour 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Edradour, in Perthshire, is owned by independent bottler Signatory, who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. However, the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  Cider apples, malt, almonds, vanilla, and honey on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and sherry. The palate is creamy and malty, with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry, plus a touch of leather. Spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
87,Old Pulteney 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery, located in the historic port of Wick, is owned by Inver House. The ‘entry level’ 12 year old expression is widely available. The nose presents pleasingly fresh malt and floral notes, with a touch of pine. The palate offers a fuller bodied, sweeter whisky than the nose might lead one to expect, with more malt, spices, fresh fruit, and a suggestion of salt. The finish is medium in length, drying, and decidedly nutty.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
87,Springbank 14 year old Amontillado Cask (#305),,Single Malt Scotch,,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 



Citrus, exotic wood, and botanicals on the nose and palate. Indeed, there’s a bit of intrigue here. Nice balance, with roasted nuts, pecan pie, and more exotic wood on the finish. ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
87,St. George’s Chapter 11 (cask strength),,Single Malt English Whisky,,"St. George’s hits pay dirt! The competition is fierce for young, big, oily, heavily peated whiskies: Kilchoman, Connemara Turf Mor, BenRiach Birnie Moss. This, though, is good enough to mix it in that sort of company. The peat growls like a Harley-Davidson, punches pepper and peat throughout, but best of all, it flicks licorice and hickory kisses just like a real life Laphroaig. Chapter 11 isn’t quite in that league yet…but it’s certainly moving in the right direction. £65 (Currently not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
87,Bakery Hill Cask Strength Single Malt,60.0,Australian Whisky,,"While much of the interest in Australian whisky has focused on Tasmania, there are mainland distilleries, such as The Great Southern Distilling Company and this one, which have been making a major contribution to the country’s growing whisky reputation. In fact, David Baker’s malt is as good as anything in Australasia. This is a Scotch-style single malt, all clean fresh green fruit, particularly apples, and some orange. The taste is zingy, with almonds and sweet chocolate-covered digestive biscuits. Delicious. AUD105 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
87,Hazelburn 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Following on from the earlier 8 year old expression of this triple distilled Campbeltown malt, the 12 year old first appeared in August 2009 and nicely illustrates the developments brought about by its continuing maturation. Rich on the nose, with a clear sherry influence, along with toffee, marzipan, apricots, and milk chocolate. This is a substantial and well integrated dram, with malt, almonds, cocoa, and spice on the palate, while the long, spicy finish offers more chocolate, soft fruits, and coffee.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
87,Auchentoshan 1977,,Single Malt Scotch,607,"This 1977 ‘house’ vintage expression has been matured for 32 years in oloroso sherry casks. Just 240 bottles have been produced. Delicate, sweet, and floral on the nose, with old leather, caramel, vanilla, and malt. The caramel deepens with time. The palate is initially sweet, smooth, and malty, with pear drops; becoming nuttier, with soft oak in the medium-length finish. £370 Currently not available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
87,Gordon & MacPhail “Private Collection” Madeira Wood Finish (distilled at Caol Ila),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Bright fruit throughout (red raspberry, strawberry-rhubarb pie, gooseberry, red currant, nectarine), honeyed malt, dark chocolate, tarry rope, seaweed soaked in olive brine, and ground pepper. Tarry finish. Nicely balanced, well-defined flavors, and fully mature at 10 years of age.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
87,"Clynelish 1993, Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice range",43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Refill sherry hogsheads have been used to mature the latest Gordon &amp; MacPhail bottling of Clynelish, the most northerly distillery in Diageo’s portfolio. Initially quite earthy on the nose, with mustard seeds, pepper, and contrasting malt. Becoming progressively sweeter and less complex. Quite oily in texture, the earthiness carries over from the nose onto the palate, then sweet fruit notes, malt, and spice emerge, plus a delicate thread of smoke. The finish dries slowly, with a hint of peat.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
87,The Dalmore Tay Dram,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,69,"Comprising 100 percent whisky matured in oloroso sherry casks, the Tay Dram is fresh and vibrant on the nose, with fruit and toffee. Fuller bodied than the Tweed or Dee Drams, with more overt evidence of sherry, followed through by honey, almonds, coffee, and toffee. Dark chocolate is to the fore in the lengthy finish — this time closer to chocolate orange confectionery. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
87,"Kilchoman, Winter 2010 Release",46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Aged in both refill and new bourbon casks. The new bourbon casks are evident, and I think it adds richness, vibrancy, and perceived maturity (which I like) when compared to the previous Summer 2010 release. Very pale in color. Brooding, with licorice root, coal tar, bacon fat, damp peat, bright fruit (citrus and pear), and intriguing botanicals, all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. Smoky, briny finish. I’m still amazed how this very young whisky can taste so mature. Well done! ",John Hansell,Summer 2011
87,GlenDronach Sauternes Finish 14 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"The rich, sweet Sauternes dessert wine adds its signature. Quite lush, with golden raisin, crème brûlée, rhubarb pie, honey-kissed citrus, and creamy vanilla. A lovely example of a dessert whisky — comforting, warming, and embracing. (I would also enjoy this after a brunch of crepes, fresh fruit, and maple syrup.) ",John Hansell,Spring 2011
88,Woodford Reserve Baccarat Edition,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"The nose is unorthodox, but not unpleasant. Herbal, with notes of dill and potpourri, with licorice, figs, coconut, and brown sugar following. The palate comes into focus with traditional flavors of fragrant vanilla, marshmallow, and bubble gum, as well as coconut, chocolate-covered almonds, popcorn, and pepper spice. The finish is lengthy, presenting baking spice, cracked pepper, and polished oak. Unusual in profile, but combining bitter herbal notes with very traditional flavors.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
88,Balvenie 14 year old The Week of Peat,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Made from the same recipe as previous Peat Week bottlings, with the name referring to the one week per year Balvenie distills peated whisky. Stone fruits lightly smoked in a peat kiln on the early nose, new leather, and honey. Sweet peat smoke, orchard fruits, and soft spices on the palate. The fruits darken in the finish, with licorice and spicy oak. (18,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Highland Park 16 year old Twisted Tattoo,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Strawberry jam and heather honey on the nose, with subtle woodsmoke, vanilla, and pineapple. Bold tropical fruits on the palate, with toffee, red berries, and more soft woodsmoke. The medium-length finish highlights licorice and drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Macallan Estate,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,250,"Distilled with a portion of barley grown on the distillery’s Easter Elchies estate. The nose detects quite intense sherry, plus black forest cake, then warm leather and fresh-squeezed orange juice. Full sherry notes on the palate, with new leather, marzipan, cherry liqueur, furniture polish, and dark chocolate. The finish yields bitter chocolate, licorice, nutmeg, and tingling wood spices.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Springbank 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. A whiff of brine on the early nose, with damp earth, citrus fruit, cereal, and mildly smoky oak. The palate is supple and offers vanilla toffee, cedarwood, hazelnuts, and more brine. A spicy finish yields coconut and a hint of dry peat.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Tamdhu 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Relatively dry on the nose, with citrus fruit, hazelnut, and quite dry sherry. The palate is full and rich, with sweeter sherry notes, cinnamon, and banoffee pie. Jaffa oranges, hot chocolate, and slightly tannic oak in the medium-length finish.

88,Balvenie 2009 vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,661,"This was aged in new American oak and selected for its faint smokiness, believed to have been picked up from a previous peated spirit run.

88,Big Peat Christmas Edition 2018,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,75,"Windswept and coastal: rock pools, the chalky sweetness of Edinburgh rock candy, and aromas of smoked fish on the quayside. The masochism of bonfire smoke and peat reek is utterly invigorating and restorative. Lemon creaminess, with an eruption of spice and citrus, the irascible spices pushing out in all directions.

Vanilla, lemon, cream, and shortbread, this puffs out beautifully with a tug of pepper, always in balance, before relaxing into lemon meringue pie territory, with those sweet lemons persisting into the finish.

88,Navazos Palazzi Spanish Grain,,Spanish Whisky,120,"A sultry, earthy, fragrant whisky, with black cherry, currants, dunnage warehouses, sherry, ground ginger, dry oak, and chili flakes. Warm and enticing, this displays great structure: black cherry, sultana, and dried fig; a middle phase of cavorting spices that are soothed into a lengthy finish of spicy, rich dried fruits. Plenty of sherry character makes this a delicious find, but it would be interesting to try a less cask-driven expression. (900 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019

88,Starward Nova,41.0,Australian Whisky,55,"Braided apple puff pastry, sultana, custard, a hint of blueberry, and jam slathered over warm scones, backed by hot chocolate and Christmas spices.

88,Sagamore Spirit Port Finish Rye,,Rye Whiskey,70,"Rose petal and grapefruit meet clove-like spice, but it’s the soapy floral sachet and dill notes that distinguish this rye.

88,Fukano Vault Reserve #1,,Japanese,90,"Herbal with roasted sage leaves, coriander seed, savory meat juices, and a twinge of tarragon, though there are fruity qualities like fresh peach and clementine.

88,Bearface Triple Oak 7 year old,,Canadian,40,"Lots of complexity follows the Canadian triad of caramel, pepper, and cleansing pith. Master blender Andres Faustinelli sourced 7 year old whisky in Okanagan red wine barrels then finished it in virgin, air-dried, 4 year old Hungarian oak. Rich oak and red wine on the nose lead to exotic spices, tingling peppers, burley tobacco, and vaguely phenolic grape skins on a buttery palate.

88,Compass Box The Story of the Spaniard,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,65,"Nobody was expecting this Spanish proposition, as the inquisitive John Glaser adds the first new permanent addition to the range in many years. Its chief weapons are Spanish red wine, spiced orange, cranberry, redcurrant, and ristras of dried red chili pods hanging in doorways. The ruthlessly efficient palate has red wine notes, spicy chili heat, and an almost fanatical devotion to the pepper. Pour a glass and fetch the cushions.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,John Walker & Sons XR 21 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Sliced apple, fig rolls, hot chocolate powder, baked orange, seasoned oak, and a wisp of light smoke like a red glow from burning newspaper. It has a contented, unperturbed, insouciant character. Cinnamon toffee yields to sweeter notes, with vanilla, dried fruits, and baked peach, and then goes long on nutmeg under drifting smoke. The woodiest of Walkers, this concludes with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice, and a catch of smoke. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,79,"Beeswax candles, wafers in vanilla ice cream, dried apricots, a strand of garden bonfire smoke, dried-out wedges of honeydew melon, and fruit shortcake cookies. The palate revels in barley sugar, active spices, lime, orange, and grapefruit peel, and it’s beautifully weighted with fudge and vanilla sponge cake. A mouth-clinging finish saturates the taste buds with sweet, honeyed fruits.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,White Walker by Johnnie Walker,,Blended Scotch Whisky,36,"Chillingly good bottle for winter, this Game of Thrones tie-in sees a rakish striding man donning body armor, gripping an ice blade, and nodding a frosty greeting through glowing blue eyes. Room temperature aromas speak of toffee, lime zest, menthol, waxy foliage, and pronounced grain notes. Straight from the freezer, there are cornflakes, beeswax, caramel, vanilla, sharp citrus, sugared apple, and a hint of nutmeg.

Original,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,24,"Triple distilled classic containing a blend of pot still, malt, and grain whiskeys, this layers aromas of spice over toffee, creamy banana, light vanilla, sharp green apple, and zested limes.

The flavor delivery is well balanced with orange, honey, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, and pepper, with the masterful spices quelling the fruitiness in the end. Breton is an endangered language, so pour a glass and raise a toast. Yec’hed mat!",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Jack Daniel’s Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,38,"Quite confectionery and billowing with fruity candies—banana taffy, bubble gum, Pixy Stix, red cinnamon gumdrops, and Swedish Fish.

88,Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Sherry Cask Matured,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,41,"This is rich in cask characters, with baked orange, pronounced nutmeg notes, mace, peppercorn, and petrichor. The opening flavors of dark orange and syrupy caramel swerve headlong into pepper, root ginger, allspice, and nippy clove. Despite appearances, this is not awash with sherry-dominated fruitiness, but the finish is long, with spice-led dried fruits. £32",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Glendalough Triple Barrel,42.0,Irish,55,"Three is the magic number: bourbon, oloroso, and canteiro-seasoned madeira barrels bring forth an intense whiskey that radiates summer warmth with unctuous raisin sweetness, candied orange peel, honey, ground cumin, peppercorn, and toasted oak. Peppercorn and oak char follow fruity-sweet flavors of apple, cranberry, cherry, and sultana. This impressive grain whiskey is more assertively spicy than their malts, but displays even greater depth and character than Glendalough Double Barrel. €48",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Vicomte Cask Strength,,French Whisky,60,"One for the fruit fiends: honeyed apricots, tart kumquats, candied pineapple, dried kiwi, and layered spices—ginger, cardamom, licorice—on the nose.

88,Woodinville Straight 100% Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,42,"Peach, blueberry, candied raspberry, and lime lead the way, with marzipan and a background of peppery spice aromas set artfully against soft, subtle wood. A mouth-filling palate offers lemon and raspberry, along with ginger, cinnamon, chocolate, and honey. Water coaxes tropical notes of melon and pineapple.

88,Woodinville Straight Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Black pepper and toasted oak on the nose mingle with deeper aromas of blackcurrant and strawberry preserves. The palate is smooth, showing flavors of vanilla bean, coconut, peppermint, and cinnamon. Dark chocolate emerges on the back palate, along with pepper and tobacco leaf.

Five years of aging have created a solid, well-constructed bourbon that has impressive depth and complexity.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
88,Domaine Hautes Glaces Les Moissons,,French Whisky,95,"Bright, fresh, fruity, and clean, with a nose of fresh cream, pressed flowers, ripening green melon, green apple, and cut pear, mellowing into baked fruit tarts, rubbed lemon peel, and spice. It’s a very sweet mouthful of sugary candy, vanilla fudge, lemon bonbon, sherbet, and fermenting apple laced with a few tangy strands of citrus. A long-lasting sweet finish, with lemon and an initial spicy buzz. €84",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Bellevoye Blue,40.0,French Whisky,35,"A well-developed nose of rich toffee, blackcurrant, red apple, and beeswax, which incorporates a mild layer of spice. Mandarin orange shines through, quite a fleshy texture overall, with chocolate buttons, and pepper and clove stepping in from the wings; the clove and a bitter note eventually taking center stage. The flavor development, complexity, and spices are laudable, and the texture and weight are distinctively different.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Bellevoye White,40.0,French Whisky,45,"A blend of three malts with a finish in sauternes barrels; the sweet wine gracing the whisky with a light, delicate frame. It takes a while to open up, unfurling flavors of brioche, egg custard, walnut baklava, ground cumin, and a conspicuous vanilla scent. Cinnamon commands the palate, supported by peach, nectarine, and vanilla, with a nuttiness and base notes of spice, rounding off with cinnamon, pepper, and baked orange.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Balnellan 12 year old Speyside Glenlivet,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,33,"Enjoy fresh aromas in multiple ways, like fruit (melon, pear, blueberry) and a sea breeze (oyster shell, salty). Full flavors of tangerine, Bosc pear, salted pistachio, white pepper, dried ginger, and mint are diminished only by the light body. The finish is particularly satisfying, but a little more heft would make it shine. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
88,Hickory Hill 12 year old Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 2),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Aromas of peanuts, sassafras, Cheerwine soda, nutty oak, and a sweep of cloves, allspice, and ginger, sprinkled with blackberries and cherries. There’s zippy citrus on the palate, a nice lift of heavier oak, roasted nut, dark chocolate, and baking spice flavors. But the richness stops short on the finish, which is light and quick.

88,Olde Point 4 year old,40.0,Canadian,15,"Dessert is served. Blueberries and raspberries baked into a sweet pie crust, with pistachio, spiced almonds, and marzipan on the nose. The palate has gentle spice and a heft of deeper flavors—caramel, semi-sweet chocolate, candied berries and almonds, and orange gummy wedges—balanced by vanilla and coconut. Though light, it finishes with a satisfying richness of berry candy and polished oak. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
88,Crown Royal Deluxe,40.0,Canadian,25,"Although grain changes every year due to the weather, the flavor of Crown Royal Deluxe remains consistent. The skilled blenders who make this entry-level Crown Royal use their finely tuned noses, not a recipe, to ensure this. Wood, orchard fruits, floral tones, and gallons of vanilla on the nose translate into butterscotch, peppery rye spices, and creamy vanilla fudge on the palate.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2018
88,Evan Williams Single Barrel 2009 Vintage,,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Floral and minty on the nose, with dusty cedar chest and earth over red and yellow apple. The palate offers a decent concentration of flavors, with citrus oil, apricot, and mouthwatering juiciness. It’s nicely layered and well-balanced, but short on the finish. This whiskey has ranged widely over the years, and as a single barrel selection your experience may vary.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
88,Four Roses Small Batch,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Oak-driven nose, where dusty oak floorboard meets light brown sugar and some herbal notes. On the palate this delivers tropical fruits, with hints of banana and papaya, and features a nice slick mouthfeel that succumbs to drying tannins, ending with nutty qualities and earthy forest floor. Simple and easy to enjoy.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
88,Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"This ever-popular expression of Balvenie is matured for roughly 12 years in ex-bourbon casks and finished for 9 months in Spanish oak oloroso sherry casks.

88,Penderyn Myth,43.0,Welsh Whisky,60,"Fresh fruits, satsuma peel, lime zest, pear, lemon meringue pie, and a cheeky burst of spices in this red wine and American oak bourbon barrel-finished whisky. Marshmallow softness, with apple, cooked Jell-O, and cherry slam into fruit-skin bitterness, chicory root, and aniseed, descending into spicy bitter fruit flavors. This perks the palate up no end. Oak seems to hold stronger cards than the wine soaked into the staves.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Port Askaig 8 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,65,"This addition to the Port Askaig range is presented with natural color, without chill filtration, and matured in refill American oak casks.

The finish is sweet, with receding smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Speyburn 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"A mix of American and Spanish oak casks was used to mature this addition to the core range. A big blast of orchard and tropical fruits characterizes the early nose, along with honey, vanilla, and toffee.

The finish is quite short, with banana and ginger.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Balcones Brimstone,53.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Distilled from roasted blue corn. The spirit itself, not the grain, is smoked over Texas scrub oak. Spicy Red Vines, herbal notes, and blackened corn aromas. An initial burst of fire on the palate transforms into juicy red fruit, sweet cinnamon apple, and hints of bramble and forest floor. An unusual and polarizing whiskey, Brimstone is aggressive at first, but in the end it’s a gentle giant.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
88,Big Peat Fèis Ìle 2018,48.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,65,"Well-balanced offering of sweet citrus, grapefruit peel, and beach bonfire smoke. Cream, lemon, and lime zest are overcome by smoke as the chili spice and pepper go off like a rocket. More disciplined, it settles down to sweet orange, lemon bonbon, cocoa, and driftwood smoke. An incredibly pale whisky, it’s punchy, but not overly complex, although it does include some fun stickers to let you customize your own bottle. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Islay Blended Malt,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,42,"One of four new affordable blended malts in the range, this delivers a direct line of clean, pure smoke; richly peaty, with shrimp shells, salty sea spray, fresh citrus peel, vanilla, and the aroma of fine cigar smoke. There’s an elegant purity to the nose. The palate takes a different course, with tangy, sharp citrus, bitter orange, herbal notes, lemon sherbet, shortbread, and jagged spices. Quite a stallion. £32",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Jura 18 year old,44.0,Single Malt Scotch,125,"Jura has introduced a new house style of ‘sweetness and smoke,’ and this spent 18 years in bourbon barrels, with a finish in red wine casks.

This single grain has bright, floral aromas with light honey, orange and lemon peel, freshly unwrapped bubble gum, rose water, and an edge of spice.

Very rich and aromatic, dripping with barbecue sauce, paprika, juicy red apple, and smoked bacon on the nose. A full panoply of barbecue flavors on the palate—brisket, roast chicken, ribs. Cayenne, walnuts, and spiced ginger balanced with oranges, apples, and pears. Some tar and creosote notes. Juicy, meaty, and smoky all at the same time. The herbal, vegetative notes are intriguing, but can be divisive.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
88,Breuckelen Project No. 1 Bottled in Bond Wheated Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"The nose begins with notes of cinnamon, soft oak, cardamom, white pepper, and a hint of new wood.

88,Samaroli by Samaroli 2017 Edition,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,176,"A smart little 8 year old blended malt with notes of light vanilla, hay bales, fresh flowers, and orange-flavored candies. Light, clean, and easy to like. The palate majors in orange flavors, first orange juice, with crunchy biscuit, gingerbread, and fizzy sherbet in the middle. It’s packed with flavor and depth, and ends with orange lollipops. The tanginess ricochets around the mouth, leaving a deep glow of citrus.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Compass Box Hedonism,43.0,Blended Grain Scotch Whisky,115,"Oat flapjacks, golden syrup, beautiful dry-roasted spice notes, vanilla essence, cornbread, creamed coconut, and flashes of mango and apple.

The meatiness in Cragganmore’s new make spirit has long since mellowed in the cask. Light orange, vanilla, honey, and those nuggets of hard sherbet that spark up on the tongue. The second phase opens up toffee notes, wood spice, flapjacks, and ends with nougat and orange peel. (Batch 2; 130 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
88,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 35 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,150,"Lighter in character than the 50 year old, batch 4 offers aromas of caramel, artisanal chocolate, red fruits, polished brogues, and a fluttering of Asian spices. It has plenty of personality, with molasses, chocolate treacle cake, date, fig, bramble, and black currant, though those spices return, and then it gets rather woody. A sprightly older blend, but beginning to show its age. (1,428 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018

88,Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,92,"An aroma you can really chew on, this comes at you big and bold, its dried cherry, fig, and caramel flavors woven with pipe tobacco, licorice, and saddle leather. The jolt of sweetness and spice on the palate pour on and on. Water helps to temper the heat and release even more flavors, with currant, chocolate, and drying oak on the finish. Sourced Indiana bourbon finished in oloroso sherry, Pedro Ximenez, and Cognac casks.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
88,Johnnie Walker Black Label The Director’s Cut,49.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"A futuristic bottle design released for Ridley Scott’s replicant sequel set in 2049, hence the punchy bottling strength. Peat smoke, toffee caramels, fresh banana, and sliced red apple. Promising layers of fruit salad, grape, apple, citrus, and apricot are swept aside by an aggressive peppery attack, emerging to notes of bitter fruit, burnt rubber, and smoke. If this is a glimpse of the future, I’m stockpiling regular Black Label now. (39,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Bunnahabhain Pedro Ximénez Cask Finish 15 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill Pedro Ximénez butts. The nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate, fudge, sultanas, and mixed candied peel. Lush, sweet sherry on the palate, with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. Long in the nutty, spicy finish, which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,Kilchoman Red Wine Cask Matured,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,125,"Distilled in 2012, this was aged in casks sourced from the Douro Valley in Portugal. Quite reticent on the early nose, with developing strawberries, vanilla custard, new oak, and subtle smoke. The palate offers smoky red wine notes, with ashy peat, spices, and tingling black pepper becoming more apparent. Sweet cherry fruitiness lingers in the relatively long finish with prickly spices.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,St. George 35th Anniversary,41.0,Craft Whiskey,500,"A perfumed nose of lilac, mint, orange flower water, and powdery Sweethearts candy introduces this pretty whiskey, as distinctive tangerine citrus meets papaya and tropical flavors. The malty palate is broad, sweet, and pure, delivering some bubble gum and confectionery notes. Very enjoyable, and almost juicy in its fruit bomb of flavors.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
88,Chicken Cock 8 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"It begins with corn pudding, savory and sweet, developing into cornbread, cookie dough, and tapioca pudding. This is followed by cinnamon bread, raw walnut, and malt. Around mid-palate, a dominating spice kicks in. This spice remains toward the finish, where the cinnamon just pleasantly sits there. Fun sipper.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
88,Exclusive Malts 2005 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory) 11 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The nose opens with brine, fresh pine, sage, and sweet antiseptic. Peat, ginger, black pepper, lime, and lemon notes develop in time. Citrus fruits, caramel, and a peat-fueled barbecue on the palate, with background dark berries. The finish is medium in length, warming, and spicy, with plain chocolate and drying, crumbly peat. (Cask no. 13; 275 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88, Kings County Straight Rye,51.0,Rye Whiskey,,"An alluring and inviting nose promises sweet tea, mint, dill, and a full Thanksgiving dessert spread. The palate delivers, with flavors of blueberry crumble, cherry tart, and candied ginger. The juicy spice is counterbalanced by oak that’s slightly too bitter and tannic, with notes of dry walnuts and chili powder. But a warm, spicy, and rounded finish helps bring the whiskey home. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
88,The English Smokey,43.0,Single Malt English Whisky,75,"This lives up to its name with leaf bonfire smoke, vanilla essence, and ginger preserves. Distiller David Fitt chooses malt peated to the same level as Port Ellen maltings delivers to Laphroaig. Assertive flavors of raw ginger, peppercorn, and chili flakes succumb to soothing vanilla cream and herbal notes. It leaves a creaminess on the lips and a mouth-coating finish of bonfire smoke and ground pepper. (480 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Moon Harbour Pier #2 Peated Edition,,Blended Scotch Whisky,70,"Was the short finish in Château La Louvière casks from Bordeaux’s Pessac-Léognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty whisky? A gorgeous color with a nose of sooty, charcoal intensity, hints of chocolate, vanilla pod, clove, and peppercorn. Flavors of cherry, rhubarb, orange peel, and plums, speckled with aniseed, pepper, clove, and licorice indicate cask influence. Suggestions of menthol and peppermint, before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Allt-a-Bhainne) 9 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,65,"A single cask, cask strength whisky finished in a first-fill bourbon barrel. The initial nose is slightly earthy, with walnuts, Juicy Fruit gum, vanilla, and ripe peach notes in time. Full, sweet fruit notes on the palate, peaches in syrup, overripe pineapple, with milk chocolate, fudge, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length and perennially spicy, with aniseed notes. (Cask no. 170)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Aultmore) 9 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Aged in bourbon wood, then finished in an oloroso sherry cask. The result is a whisky with a nutty nose, plus sultanas, figs, vanilla, and background sherry, becoming more floral in time. Full-bodied on the palate, with sweet sherry notes, ginger, and cinnamon, and developing raisin and prune notes. The finish is long, with spicy coffee and blackberries. (Cask no. 900160)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,StoneHammer Distiller’s Reserve,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Think cherries—they dominate the nose over earth, oak, and blueberries. Then it’s leather, tobacco, cigar box, and burnt pie crust edges. Finally, two notes become one, as cherry pie, with hints of rhubarb and cola. It sets itself up to be a prime whiskey, but the notes just fall off on a short finish. If only the backbone held up, this could be remarkable stuff.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
88,Lambay Small Batch Blend,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,35,"This Cognac cask-finished whiskey has light, airy aromas of vanilla cream, heather honey, golden syrup, flaked coconut, and whole orange. Baked pastries and tangy orange precede a mid-palate spice rush, with grapefruit flavors building through a lengthy, spicy finish. Several sourced Irish whiskeys use local water to cut down to bottling strength; Lambay uses water drawn from the island’s Trinity Well.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Kurayoshi 18 year old,50.0,Japanese,220,"The high-alcohol strength is apparent on the nose, which is dominated by pepper, clove, and star anise spices. A mouth-drawing concoction that begins softly, with honey, orange, and apple peel, then grows in scale at the expense of the sweetness. There’s a takeover by root ginger and bitter fruit skins. The long-lasting finish reverberates with crackling spices and sour fruits. (1,140 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Kurayoshi Sherry Cask 3 year old,46.0,Japanese,80,"Nutty dried fruits, pear and apple, light pepper, and an old knob of dried ginger. The sherry notes are more reminiscent of amontillado or palo cortado. The sherry works well with the whisky, bringing dried peels, nuts, golden caramels, and spicy pepper, the latter surging forth to dominate the last remnants of fudge-like sweetness. Attractively tasty, this has a finish of juicy peel, clove, and pepper. (720 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Reisetbauer 7 year old,43.0,Austrian Whisky,90,"The youngest offering has an attractive fruity nose with red apple, menthol, and wax candles, all nicely backed with spicy oak. Honey-dipped apple slices, citrus, chocolate-covered raisins, and very gentle spice make this a most agreeable sipping whisky. The finish has coffee grounds with a pinch of spice. Perfectly delicious, it’s just a little meek and light bodied, with a shorter flavor trajectory.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Black,45.0,World Whisky,50,"A deeper corn note than White, the Oaxacan black corn retains a firm nugget of sweetness, aromas of banana skins and dusty earth. To sip, it’s creamy, cool, and refreshing, with light mandarin flavors, gingerbread, corn fritters, vanilla, and peppery heat from the French oak cask. The finish has gentle warmth, with root ginger and kernels of roasted corn. Distinctive and highly promising.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Connemara 12 year old,40.0,Irish,75,"Connemara’s wild west coast landscape is a world away from this peated whiskey’s production at Cooley Distillery on Ireland’s east coast. Greater smoke than Original; lemon and fresh cream translate into lemon lozenges and sherbet, with tangy tropical fruits and well-balanced smoke lasting throughout the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,The Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2002 Vintage),,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This expression dates from 2002, when Balvenie first produced a batch of heavily peated malt. Matured in American oak casks, the nose exhibits subtle peat balanced by honey, vanilla, and ripe red apples. On the palate, the soft smoke is well integrated with vanilla, more honey, ginger, and overripe pears. Ashy peat, citrus fruits, cinnamon, and tangy oak in the finish. An elegant peated whisky.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
88,Caol Ila 18 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This unpeated version of Caol Ila was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is quite reticent, with subtle vanilla and milk chocolate notes. Big, fizzy-sweet fruit notes on the palate, with caramel, rock pools, hot spices, plain chocolate, and very mild wood smoke. Bubble gum and peppery chocolate in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
88,Kilbeggan Single Grain,43.0,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,30,"Smooth, delicious, and easygoing, this has sweet cereal and biscuit notes, vanilla, macaroon bars, salt, pepper, and lemon zest on the nose. Sweet caramel, smooth honey, zested mandarin, gentle wood spices, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, mango, guava, and papaya, with a finish of cereal notes and dried tropical fruits. Provenance watchers: Beam Suntory makes grain at Cooley Distillery, and the Kilbeggan name was appended to Irish blends in the past.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,Convalmore 32 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled in 1984, just a few months before the distillery closed, this was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. A whiff of early earthiness gives way to pear drops, honey, vanilla, and resin on the nose. Pears, pineapple, caramel, and vanilla on the slightly waxy, spicy palate. Slowly drying in the medium-length finish, with peppery licorice and a hint of char. (3,972 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
88, Big Peat Christmas Edition 2017,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,70,"Big Peat looks incredibly pale in the glass this year, but his message is undiminished. Antiseptic, pine-scented floor cleaner, and an enveloping cloud of peat smoke with underlying peach and faint dabs of lemon. Sugary sweet, with lemon lozenges, light vanilla, caramel, and dark toffee, while a bowling, somersaulting smoky element gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth. Hot, dry finish, like gargling with hot coals. Merry Peatmas everybody.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,F.E.W. Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,50,"There is a freshness to the wood on the nose, laced with caramel and delicate minty notes. The palate pours pleasantly chewy with molten butterscotch and offers a pleasant jolt of cinnamon and clove that suggests rye at work, before settling on bitter orange peel, salted caramel, and cocoa, leading to a drying leathery and warm spice finish. Nicely done.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
88,Ohishi Sherry Single Cask No. 833,,Japanese,75,"If you are a scotch drinker contemplating your first Japanese rice whisky purchase, this is the one. Dates, Christmas cake, glazed gammon, red cherry, and muted roasted spices show the quality of the cask. Raspberry <i>coulis</i> and cranberry make for a juicy palate that evolves into caramel, fudge, chili, and pepper. Spices rule the finish, the fruit fading quickly. A great introduction to Fukano single casks. (527 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,Carlyle,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,13,"This noble Scot consists of a blend of 20 different whiskies and impresses with its nose of hazelnut, dark chocolate, vanilla pod, menthol, peppercorn, and wisps of damp wood smoke. Warm chocolate fudge, mellow spices, dark burnished orange, smooth oak, old leather, and malted milk. The mouthfeel is weighty enough to sustain the heavyweight flavors. Long finish of dark rum, cocoa, and spiced chocolate. Just add your own favorite leather armchair. Value pick.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,J. Mossman Gold Crown 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,43,"Aromas of oloroso sherry, strawberry, almond paste, clove, licorice Allsorts, black treacle, and smoke from burning haystacks. Honeyed palate with citrus elements, light lemon, green melon, pear, redcurrant, and pineapple, brightened by some well-rounded spices and root ginger. It glides into a mouthful of chocolate-coated digestive biscuits with a little smoke, then a finish of citrus oils, fruit skins, and active spices. Brilliant and satisfying.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,Woodford Reserve Blended Rye,,Rye Whiskey,50,"This whiskey is bananas. Is it banana pudding atop vanilla wafers or warm Bananas Foster melting into vanilla ice cream? It’s hard to say, but the lovely banana-vanilla combination dominates until baked pears, pumpkin bread, rye, and baking spices appear. A medium to long finish brings a bright cherry note. Price is per 375 ml.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
88,Stranahan’s “Yellow Label” Colorado Single Malt,47.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"While the aroma is tightly wound at first, it gradually reveals layers of brown sugar and warming spice, apple and pear fruits woven through with opulent toasted oak. The palate entry is soft and rounded but quickly picks up steam, with layers of biscuity malt, peppercorns, blackberry fruit, and a lovely salted butter note that brings nice balance to the finish. Fully mature, pleasingly complex, and it keeps getting better!",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
88,Berkshire Bourbon Smoke and Peat,43.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"It would be easy to hate on this as bourbon, but taken merely as a whiskey, it’s compelling, original, and surprisingly well-knit. The nose betrays the smoke and sea of its Islay cask finish, while the palate offers more sweet vanilla, candied nuts, and citrus before circling back with distinct vegetal notes of seaweed and jalapeño. Perhaps bourbon is in the eye of the beholder.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2017
88,Pike Creek 21 year old Speyside Cask Finish,45.0,Canadian,90,"Pike Creek is all about creating a rich blend, then finishing it in barrels previously filled with other flavorful spirits. Standard versions feature Port and rum finishes. This 21 year old edition spent nearly 6 months in Speyside malt whisky casks. The fruity Speysider left no smokiness behind, just spices, red fruits, and buttery barley malt. Extra rye makes for a spicier blend with a longish, dark fruit finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2017
88,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 43 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,108,"Like a throwback to childhood: fruity lollipops, Love Hearts, and gobstoppers. Stewed apple, crusty bread, and dry roasted coriander seeds add more dimension to the nose. The palate has toffee, orange peel, dates, and briefly flirts with chocolate and coffee, though this grain has mouth-drawing astringency and savory spices to balance the sweetness. Long finish of aniseed, spiced dark toffee, and charred oak.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
88,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Moray) 9 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,85,"Distilled in September 2007 and matured in a first-fill bourbon barrel (#5315), this is a fine example of how good a relatively youthful Speyside malt can be, given the right cask. Soft and fragrant on the nose, with lemongrass, ginger snaps, and light toffee notes. The palate is sweet, with ripe strawberries and spicy fudge. A spicy finish offers cinnamon, milk chocolate, and lingering citrus fruits. (220 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
88,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Clynelish) 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,265,"Distilled in October 1995, this single cask was aged in a refill hogshead (#10206). Primrose, ginger, cedar spice, and malt on the nose, with a hint of salt and background heather; complex. Slightly oily on the palate, with orchard fruits, milk chocolate, a suggestion of brine, and developing cloves. Dries quite rapidly in the finish, with more cloves and light oak tannins. (190 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
88,Jura 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"This is the first release in the distillery’s new core range for the U.S. After primary maturation in bourbon barrels, the 10 year old whisky undergoes a sherry cask finish. Orange marmalade, pine nuts, white pepper, and very subtle smokiness on the nose. The palate majors in overripe Jaffa oranges, ginger, and milk chocolate. The milk chocolate darkens in the medium-length finish, with coffee grounds and warming spice.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
88,Mars Iwai,40.0,Japanese,35,"The original Iwai pot stills from the 1960s have been retired and now stand outside the Mars Shinshu Distillery. Cajoled by the savory, almost gamey aromas assimilated with brown apple and old strawberries, the whisky is surprisingly candy sweet to the taste. Dark jellied fruits: first Rowntree’s Fruit Gums, then Fruit Pastilles. Hazelnut, gentle oriental spices, and chicory coffee usher in a deep, fruity finish with creamy chocolate and fresh mint.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
88,Hyde No. 3 The Áras Cask 6 year old,46.0,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,50,"If you were expecting a young, grainy aroma, you would be much mistaken. Multi-layered nose of fudge, vanilla, pecan cookies, soda bread, and Ice Breakers mints. Ethereal and soft array of creamy vanilla, pear, fruity hard candy, and greengage, before a groundswell of pepper, star anise, and clove. Evolving juicier, tropical fruit notes risk being swamped in spice. The dough, gingersnaps, and hot finish remind us it’s grain. Hyde? Go seek. (5,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
88,Blanton’s Single Barrel (no. 498),,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Oh, that rickhouse smell: charred oak, leather, vanilla, and a slight hint of coconut. Then it’s caramel, toasted walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, and moon pie, with hints of black licorice and cumin. Strong tobacco and ginger notes present themselves just before a delightful finish with hints of crème brûlée and vanilla custard. This is a regular sipper in my house.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
88,Suntory Toki,43.0,Japanese,40,"This is a handy core ingredient for many cocktails, combining single malts from Yamazaki and Hakushu with grain from Chita. Dying embers of burnt heather and aromas of sliced apples browning through careless neglect. A complex interplay between the smoky embers, roasted spices, tiger fruit, coriander, and whole peppercorn precedes a sweet taste of buttered popcorn, orchard fruit, and burnished orange, supported by increasingly provocative pepperiness. Quaffable and versatile.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
88,Pendleton 20 year old Directors’ Reserve 2017,40.0,Canadian,125,"Joining the core Pendleton lineup, with a new edition expected each September. Past releases of Director’s Reserve have been irregular, perhaps because a local rancher killed the buzz when he bought the entire first batch nearly a decade ago. A luxuriously creamy body coats your palate with mild vanilla, butterscotch, restrained white pepper, and nutty plum pudding. Pencil shavings punctuate a medium finish. Less complexity than its age predicts.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2017
88,Classic Cask 23 year old Caribbean Rum Barrels,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,160,"I’m reminded of leafy ferns in spring, sweet melon, green bananas, fresh cream, and a dusting of spice when I nose this blend. A light, green fruit taste of white grape and melon overlaid with runny toffee and banana, before the impression of thick fruit skins, becoming slightly tannic. Light spices and pepper follow with a finish of apple core and rich spice. (760 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
88,Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel #17B302),,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Initially there’s a lot going on. Bakery confectionary meets spice rack, followed by dried oak, toasted oak, covered baked apples, canned peaches, and dried apricot. Then tobacco and leather strike before mouth-coating butterscotch and vanilla icing. Once these notes dissipate, lighter baked fruits and jams walk this into a medium finish. While good, this whiskey could have been great if it maintained its initial complexity.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
88,Ardbeg Kelpie,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,119,"A proportion of the component whiskies has been matured in virgin Black Sea oak casks, while the rest has been aged in bourbon barrels. The nose is sweet, with warm cloves and soft peat; a hint of brine. When it comes to the palate—curious! Menthol and herbal notes, toasted oak, plain chocolate, sweet antiseptic. Mildly tannic in the finish, with subtle peaty spiciness. An herbal peat note lingers long.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
88,Bladnoch Talia 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,385,"The revival of Bladnoch Distillery in southwest Scotland continues, with the launch of 15 and 25 year old expressions to add to the NAS Samsara (<em>reviewed winter 2016</em>). Talia has been finished in new American oak casks. Sweet and floral on the nose, with violets, Jaffa orange, and fragrant fresh oak. Medium to full-bodied, with rich fruit notes, praline, malt, and finally, raisins and prunes. Dark oak in the long, mouth-drying finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
88,Loch Lomond,46.0,Single Grain Whisky,29,"A rare beast of 100% malted barley mash distilled in a Coffey still. Dried grasses, butterscotch toffee, honey spread across hot toast, fresh green apples, custard creams, and peppercorns leap from the glass. From the sweet apple, lemon, orange, and honey, it fleshes out with toffee apple, sweet vanilla, and cinnamon stick, concluding with a little more grain character and spice on the finish. Delicious stuff!",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
88,Tobermory 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,160,"Like its Ledaig stablemate, this Tobermory is offered non-chill filtered at cask strength. Finishing occurred in <em>manzanilla</em> sherry casks. Orange marmalade, nutmeg, and developing vanilla on the nose. Full bodied, with a palate of citrus fruit and soft spices, aniseed, and developing tannins. Lingering in the finish, with spicy plain chocolate. Ultimately, the tannins fade and leave a fresh citric note.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
88,Glen Moray 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Matured in bourbon casks, this expression offers a sweet, pleasing nose of honey, icing sugar, toffee bonbons, and orange peel. Medium-bodied, with barley sugar, soft oak, nectarine, and lychee. Vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
88,Duncan Taylor 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"When in doubt, the answer to any question is usually ‘more whisky.’ Here, peat smoke takes an upper hand over the sweet aromas of juicy orange and pear. The whisky begins icing-sugar sweet, settles to bubble gum, pear, apple, and malt, showing its impeccably balanced, finely textured character replete with strands of oak spices, gentle smoke, baked pastry, and vanilla custard. You can’t go wrong at this price.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
88,anCnoc Flaughter,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Peated to 14.8 ppm, this expression from anCnoc’s Peaty Collection falls between Rutter and Cutter in terms of its phenolic level. Immediately smoky on the nose, with oily fudge and milky coffee. Well-balanced in the mouth, with rich flavors of peat, soft fruit, and vanilla, plus a hint of brine and iodine. The finish is lengthy, with peat embers, walnuts, and more iodine.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
88,Tipperary Boutique Selection Watershed,47.0,Irish,70,"Fresh and approachable, with lemon curd, green apples, almond, and caramelized brown sugar. Sweet lemon and honey, icing sugar, and little twists of orange peel, then as it relaxes, nougat, nuttiness, Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal flavors, and more creaminess. The finish keeps a grip on the front of the mouth. This sip of Tipp will do me just fine until the family-run distillery is built at Ballindoney Farm.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
88,BenRiach Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wood Finish 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"As the name implies, this non-chill filtered expression was finished in Pedro Ximinez sherry butts. The nose offers sweet sherry, honey, malt, and lemon, while the palate yields more sherry, plain chocolate, honey, spicy toffee, and a hint of orange. More spicy toffee, plus drying oak in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
88,GlenDronach 14 year old Virgin Oak,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Initially matured in recharred puncheons, then transferred for an unspecified period into virgin American oak casks. The nose offers icing sugar and soft toffee, vanilla, clementine, and wood varnish. More icing sugar, with orange and fudge on the palate, plus wood spice and an herbal note. Fruity through the finish, while spice builds, with a hint of aniseed at the close. An interesting alternative to the classic sherry-rich GlenDronach style.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
88,The Glenrothes (Vintage Cask #3) 1998 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Lush and fruity. Sappy, with waxed fruit, golden raisin, plum, and nectarine rock candy. Mouth-clinging finish. Definitely post-prandial, after a hearty meal. (With a cigar, perhaps?) (<em>Loch &amp; K(e)y retailer exclusive</em>)",John Hansell,Spring 2017
88,Loch Lomond 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Like its elder sibling, Loch Lomond 12 year old is presented in non-chill filtered form, and in this case, matured in a mix of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe apricots, vanilla, and a suggestion of peat smoke on the nose.  The full palate offers oranges and pears, plus developing spicy malt and mild peatiness. Long in the finish, with spicy fruit notes. Drying, with subtle tannins.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
88,Black Bull 21 year old,50.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,160,"Thick orange peels, grapefruit, lime zest, and Starburst taffy candies keep the nose of this premium expression within the purview of the Black Bull character. Layers of vanilla custard, mellow fruit, and ginger snaps quench an initial rush of sharp citrus. Sponge cake creaminess abounds though the spices nibble at the edges, leaving a long, sweet, citrus finish. Water nips the more acidic elements while leaving the citrus flavors intact.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
88,Stalk & Barrel Blue Label Blend (tweaked),40.0,Canadian,33,"Amping up the original Blue has pushed this blend of own-distilled flavoring and sourced base whiskies deep into sipping territory. Crème brûlée and a soft vanilla nose become Werther’s caramels, until Still Waters’ signature rye spices and white pepper take charge. Add water and it blooms like a flower, dampening the spices and leaving a round, creamy, chocolate-like mouthfeel.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2017
88,Ransom Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,59,"Nuts, plum, dried red fruits, plump berries, and oak on the nose, while the palate pours lush and fruity, with a sherry-like quality with pot still richness. Cigar wrapper, wet walnuts, and pine emerge to ride the wave of vanilla, soft malt, and spice-laced baked fruits. Offers the fruity allure of a Speyside malt coupled with American bravado for a long resinous and fruity finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2017
88,Virginia Highland Malt Whisky,46.0,Craft Whiskey,60,"Malt whisky from the Scottish Highlands finished in Virginia, in Virginia wine casks. A potpourri of red fruit (raspberry, currant, cherry), tangerine, caramel, honey, and marzipan. Polished leather, tobacco, and oak on the finish. The port influence smooths out the rough edges nicely and adds depth to this youthful, lively whisky. <em>(Loch &amp; K(e)y exclusive)</em>",John Hansell,Spring 2017
88,The MacPhail’s Collection 8 year old (distilled at Bunnahabhain),43.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"Heavily peated Bunnahabhain spirit, referred to as Margadale, was used for this bottling and matured in refill sherry butts. Savory on the nose, with smoky brine, plain chocolate, and Granny Smith apples. The palate offers similar green apple notes, along with sweet peat, cocoa, and licorice. Wood smoke and pipe tobacco in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
88,Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Cask Strength,,Rye Whiskey,74,"This is 3 years old, Indiana distilled, and has a “ladle” of Maryland spring water added. It includes two rye mashbills—one high, one low—breaking the mold from similar Indiana-distilled ryes. For its youth and strength, it immediately and amazingly feels mature, showing rich caramel, spearmint, and earth. The momentum slows with subtle blueberry rye muffin, black pepper, and cardamom. It finishes medium with a hint of cornbread.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
88,Dublin Liberties Oak Devil,46.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"This blend of double distilled single malt and grain has bourbon cask and American oak written all over it. The allure of spice, vanilla cream, cedar sticks, malt, cinnamon, and banana chips draws you in. Burning brown sugar sweetness and vanilla toffee meet the snappy acidity from orange, lime, and pineapple goaded by pepper and cardamom bystanders. Undoubtedly a great session whiskey, so throw away the cork.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
88,Komagatake Rindo Nature of Shinshu,52.0,Japanese,190,"This young whisky from the Mars Shinshu Distillery was matured in Japanese wine casks. Fragrantly aromatic with perfumed florals, apple blossom, and pastel-colored chalky candy. By way of explanation, Rindo means “gentian,” the mountain flower of Nagano. Its light texture is rather sweet, with caramel, mango, a piquancy of tart oranges, and a little underlying pepper and clove. A snarl of pepper and lingering soft fruits rounds things off. (8,200 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
88,Forty Creek Founder’s Reserve Lot 104,45.0,Canadian,56,"John Hall’s tenth annual release blends 4 to 9 year old single grain barley, corn, and rye whiskies from a mix of barrels. Sweet and sour fruits, prunes, and grassy green grapes, all inside a barrel warehouse, yield a complex nose. Pears, violets, barley sugar, vanilla fudge, and hot pepper fade slowly into barrel tones and gentle bitter pith. A slightly slippery palate grows hot and spicy in the middle. Not as lush as past releases, but equally as complex. $75 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
88,Kilkerran 12 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,45,"After six ‘Work in Progress’ releases, Kilkerran from Glengyle Distillery has finally come of age with this core expression. It comprises 70% whisky from first-fill bourbon casks and 30% from sherry casks. Floral on the nose, with honey and a hint of brine, then peaty fruit notes develop. The palate is confident and oily, slightly earthy, with tinned peaches, black pepper, cinnamon, smoke, and a suggestion of medicine chests. The finish is relatively long, with pepper, licorice, and drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
88,Black Velvet Onyx 12 year old. 40%,,Canadian,28,"Dry and mildly dusty on first nosing, with a touch of pine pitch and red cedar. Tingling peppery spices and barrel notes carry onto the palate, bringing a slightly bitter counterpoint to luscious crème brûlée. Vanilla and hints of real maple syrup nuance apple pie sprinkled with baking spices, ripe black fruits, and a toffeeish but clean finish. Complex and beautifully integrated. Labeled 12 years old, Onyx includes some older whisky as well. <i>(Europe exclusive) </i>€27",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
88,Miyagikyo Single Malt,45.0,Japanese,80,"One for no age statement naysayers. An eloquent expression of sweet osmanthus, baked lemon, yuzu, violin resin, rich malts, and bonfire aromas on a favorite woolen jumper. It glides across the tongue with sweet barley sugar, but attests to greater depths; grapefruit, spicy ginger, and mandarin developing milk chocolate-coated, candied lemon flavors. A firm finish: green cardamom spices slowly releasing their grip on the front of the palate, leaving clingy vanilla. Unbound by an age statement, it’s a beautiful offering.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
88,Barrell Bourbon 9 year old (Batch 008),,Bourbon/Tennessee,85,"There’s a lot going on here: rich caramel, soft vanilla, gingerbread cookies straight from the oven, cinnamon, marzipan, honey, and peach. Then it’s a dance of the caramel/vanilla-combo richness with brown sugar, butter, and toffee. The thing is, you need to appreciate barrel strength whiskey to capture its essence, as the beasty alcohol overpowers. Even barrel strength lovers will find a splash of water opens it up, giving more caramel, walnut, and whoopie pie. Long caramel finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
88,Backbone Bourbon Uncut (batch 13),,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"Right up front, there’s really rich caramel with a lovely vanilla undertone. Then fruit, and lots of it: blackberries, blueberries, baked apples, and canned peaches, followed by wood, nutmeg, and maple syrup. It’s borderline complex, with a seamless balance and transition to the flavors. Extraordinarily rich caramel reappears over a medium, buttery, and satisfying finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
88,Bunnahabhain Toiteach,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,66,"Dried peat smoke, a papery column of cigar ash, sizzling bacon fat, baked earth, and a shower of sea spray, coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. The palate has a light, oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout, tasting of vanilla toffee, pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas, tangy citrus, and sweet tropical fruits, the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. It’s not named after the Gaelic for smoky for nothing, you know.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,Glenmorangie Tarlogan,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,82,"Tarlogan is the third and most recent release in Glenmorangie’s Legends Collection. Some of the component whisky had been matured in virgin oak casks, while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels. A hint of freshly-dug soil on the very early nose, then toffee apples, malt, and vanilla kick in. The smooth palate focuses on coconut and more vanilla, with kumquat and lime. Almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. <em>(Travel Retail exclusive)</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
88,Glenturret Fly’s 16 Masters Edition,44.0,Single Malt Scotch,124,"This limited edition 16 year old release is named after a collie dog that belonged to a distillery manager pictured in a 1905 photograph of Glenturret staff. Malt and milk chocolate, dried apricots, and subtle spice on the floral nose, with a hint of worn leather and, ultimately, ripe pears. Supple and rounded on the palate, with sweet spices, honey, black pepper, dark fruit, and coffee notes. Finally, bitter orange and plain chocolate in the medium-length finish. (1,740 bottles) £95",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
88,Tullamore D.E.W. 18 year old,,Irish,124,"After 18 years maturing in traditional oak, this triple distilled whiskey undergoes a four-cask finish in bourbon, <em>oloroso</em> sherry, port, and madeira casks. Following a 6 month period of finishing, molasses, raisins, chocolate ganache, malt loaf, and solid oak notes have emerged after careful blending of the component whiskeys. Smooth, yet thick and mouth-drawing; black fruits, treacle, wrinkled vanilla pods, chocolate chip muffins, and sticky dates. There are less than 2,500 bottles of this attractive, resinous whiskey that slips away leaving sweetness, dark fruit, and cinnamon. €110",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,Tullamore D.E.W. 15 year old Trilogy,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,80,"Here they take a triple distilled blend of pot still, malt, and grain whiskey matured in bourbon and <em>oloroso</em> sherry and finish it in golden rum casks (a favorite finishing vessel at Wm. Grant). A soft, relaxing sweetness emits from the glass, showing barley sugars, lemon bonbon, vanilla, and freshly-planed oak. The <em>oloroso</em> has been used sparingly, but rounds off the lemon, light fudge, and hazelnut flavors. There’s a spicy last stand that burns brightly. A terrific composition.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,Kilchoman Fèis Ìle 2016 bottling (distilled 2007),,Single Malt Scotch,117,"A single <em>oloroso</em> cask bottling, so an interesting comparison with the Loch Gorm <em>(see below)</em>. The cask has more of an influence here, with plummy fruits, fig rolls, and Medjool dates. The smoke is restrained and foggy, allowing some seashore breezes to come through. The palate reverses this, with the smoke rolling in first, then the soft dark and sweet fruits, treacle, and garam masala. Tannins are very soft. Kilchoman with heft. (637 bottles) £90",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
88,Gibson’s Finest Bold 8 year old,46.0,Canadian,22,"With NAS, 12, and 18 year old versions long-established as Canadian favorites, Gibson’s master blender, Brian Kinsman (of Glenfiddich), turned his hand to an 8 year old specifically intended to be mixed with Coke. Why? That’s how 40% of Canadians prefer their whisky. Rich in dark rum notes, kola nuts, vanilla pods, and sweet rye, it bursts with ripe black fruits and sizzling hot spices. Sip slowly to uncover black licorice, a touch of tannin, and the classic Canadian hot, bitter pith finish. C$29",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
88,Tiger Snake Sour Mash,43.0,Australian Whisky,100,"It’s not bourbon, but the mashbill contains corn, rye, and malted barley sourced from western Australia. It has zippy vanilla, whole hazelnut, hints of rye spiciness, overlaid with taffy candy and fresh fruit. Syrupy sweetness drenches the taste buds, peeling back honeyed layers to reveal vanilla, melon, ripe banana, citrus, and tropical green fruits, diluting to delicious coconut creaminess. A moreish small batch whiskey with a finish of custard cream biscuits that sticks it to those boys in Tennessee. A$130",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,Douglas Laing Rock Oyster Cask Strength,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,61,"A dense, suffocating fog of peat smoke, sea salt, dry seaweed on the high tide, and lemon-scented candles. Remember to come up for air once in a while. A supple, silky texture of lemon mousse, baked apple, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and a massive rush of pepper. Hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. Hot, drying finish, and, frankly, a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. £47",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,The Exclusive Blend 35 year old 1980,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,200,"If you like sherried malts, you’ll love this! Bottled at a respectable strength too. Red apple, cherry skins, strawberry, raspberry, Eccles cake, malt loaf, and warming spices; there’s a lot to get your nose into here. A finely structured dram, with soft leather, rhubarb, Bramley apple, cherryade, fresh Victoria plum, pepper, and muted ginger deliver sustained flavors. A long, spicy, and peeled fruit finish. Given the distillery closures in 1983, there could be some interesting components in here. (464 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,Hunter Laing Old Malt Cask 1996 (distilled at Arran),50.0,Single Malt Scotch,115,"This expression was distilled during Arran’s second year of operation in September 1996 and bottled at 19 years of age. The single refill hogshead yielded 288 bottles. Sweet and malty on the slick nose, with honey, lively spices, and hints of pine. Ultimately, caramel and satsuma. Full on the palate, with juicy fruit, more malt and honey, and developing milk chocolate. Long and soft in the finish; lightly spiced, finally slightly citric, with a hint of brine and dry oak. £80",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
88,Blood Oath Pact No. 2,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"A combination of 7 year old year rye finished in port barrels and 11 year old wheated and rye bourbons. It presents exceptionally fruity aromas, with prominent plum and floral hints, fresh-cut grass, toasted pecan, burnt butter, brown sugar, and a touch of chocolate. On the palate there are warm cinnamon apples, fried donut with caramel icing, and a hint of dry popcorn. The medium finish offers lovely toffee. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
88,Flaming Leprechaun Special Reserve,46.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,27,"Cinnamon-roasted pecan nuts, cedar sticks, maple cookies, and cracked black pepper make for a parched, dry nose with alluring touches of sweetness and spice. Smucker’s Magic Shell chocolate, warm fruity notes, maltiness, and pepper on the tongue. It’s so succulent, with long spices and cocoa notes concluding a sophisticated experience. Quick, go now, before the stores close.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,House of Hazelwood 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,65,"The style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of Paris in the 1920s. Comprising Kininvie and Girvan married in tuns of Portuguese oak, this is pure, creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie, vanilla tablet, and fresh oak shavings. A buttery-soft texture, the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions, nougat, and toffee, backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it’s got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. £50 Travel Retail exclusive",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
88,Benromach Heritage Collection 35 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,610,"Another example of the old ‘Strathspey’ style of whisky, which predates the lighter, more estery/floral style we have become accustomed to. Here, distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits, smoke, and Seville orange. The palate then heads into the hedgerows—hawthorn and currant jam—before a waxiness emerges. The finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. All in all, an excellent dram. £425",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
88,Lagavulin 8 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Light in color it may be, but this is no wimp. The nose goes straight to the shore with mineral and salt, but it’s also sweet, which allows it to be fresh, lively, yet balanced. The palate delivers some menthol, bay laurel, more brininess, a hint of malt, and Parma violet. Everything remains very breezy, with peat smoke being blown from a kiln into salt-laden air. I prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
88,Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond,50.0,Rye Whiskey,28,"Barely legal at 51% rye, Rittenhouse packs lots of corn, offering a different profile than those higher-rye whiskeys from Indiana. Straight from the glass burst caramel, campfire smoke, and vanilla, with hints of dill weed and Herbs de Provence. Ripe in flavor, it shows slight mint from the rye and a complex voyage of herbs with a touch of chocolate here and walnut shell there. There’s a reason bartenders love mixing with this; it’s good neat or on the rocks.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
88,Jim Beam Bonded,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,23,"Launched in 2015, this is a solid pick for the under-$30 club. Think butterscotch and caramel dripping over popcorn: the cooked sugars first, then corn kernels. Dulled spices, oak, vanilla, hints of saddle leather and earth. This isn’t complex or complicated, but the medium-to-long candy corn finish leaves me wondering about its status with two more years in the barrel. Of course, that would mean the price would go up, too.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
88,Ballantine’s 21 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,139,"Baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream, light caramel, malted milk, and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs: a lucky strike from a forest survivalist. On the palate, it is soft and blushing, with marmalade and warm butter, ground ginger, moving to chocolate orange, toffee, and Ovaltine. A whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend’s finish stylishly. This has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
88,Clan Denny (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1988,55.0,Single Grain Whisky,127,"We get off on the wrong foot with that vegetal note common to certain Strathclyde bottlings. It quickly blows over to release candied lemon and orange slices, fresh-baked honey biscuits, eucalyptus, clove, and eventually some fresh breath mints. Divinely sweet orange and lemon puddings, caramelized sugars close to burning, and soor plooms. Despite the lemon sweetness at the fringes, there remains a central core of mint and clove. Sherbet lemons fizz on the tongue to finish. All is forgiven. £88",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
88,Chivas Regal 25 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,300,"A polished nose of red apple, cinnamon, caramels, and salted almonds makes for an enticing prospect on this showpiece dram. The taste exemplifies smoothness. The indulgent palate comprises dark cooked fruits, coffee, malty cocoa, sticky toffee pudding, fudge, and a fine line of orange. Roll it around the mouth: the integrated aged grains enable these select malts to achieve their full flavor potential. An exceptionally long finish has remnants of that toffee pudding and a well-sucked aniseed ball. Treat yourself.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
88,Clynelish Select Reserve (Diageo Special Releases 2015),,Single Malt Scotch,815,"The maturation regime of this Clynelish involves first-fill American oak barrels, rejuvenated and refill American oak hogsheads, plus bodega and refill European oak butts. The minimum age in the assemblage is 15 years, and 2,946 bottles are available.  A complex, perfumed nose, with scorched grass, developing vanilla fudge, and freshly-peeled orange. Classic Clynelish waxiness on the palate, with toffee, more orange, peach, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and developing pepper. The lengthy, creamy finish features chocolate-coated orange candy and ginger.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
88,The Dalmore 30 year old,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Following on from its limited edition 21 year old release, Dalmore has introduced a 30 year old expression, with 888 numbered bottles being available. Matured in a mix of Matusalem <em>oloroso</em> and Amoroso <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts sourced from the Gonzales Byass bodega. The nose is slightly meaty, with coffee, sherry, and stewed apple. Supple on the palate, with dark, spicy orange, black currant cordial, and marzipan. Spicy tannins kick in during the very long, fruity, finally mouth-drying finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
88,Russell’s Reserve 10 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,37,"The nose tickles with caramel, spice, vanilla, and earthiness, with just a hint of balsamic vinegar.  Warming. Coated with spices, ranging from cinnamon to allspice and from coffee to nutmeg. Eventually, patented caramel and vanilla, with a fun hint of cardamom. The long, enjoyable finish is earthy, but there’s an unwanted bitterness at the end that cannot be denied. If not for the bitter end, this would rate much higher.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
88,The Sovereign (distilled at Dumbarton) 1964 50 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,548,"Rosewater, polished antique oak furniture, nail polish remover, and clove on the nose. It’s fruit forward compared to other aged examples from this closed distillery; the spiced apple and baked plum are partnered by peppery heat and chili, ginger, and fleeting hints of coffee and cocoa. The flavors throb out of this one, producing a long-lasting experience ending with a dry finish of soft fruits and ginger. A splash of water coaxes out nougat and makes the spices behave. (162 bottles) £380",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
88,O&#039;Danagher&#039;s American (Batch 1),45.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"This Dry Fly Distilling project is made from grains grown in Washington by farmer Tim O&#039;Danaher <em>[note that different spellings are correct]</em>. Off to a good start: a luxuriously sweet cereal aroma puffs out of the glass as I pour, and adds softened dried fruits and hard candy when actively nosed. The new American oak (53-gallon barrel) is evident immediately, tempering the sweetness with spice, walnuts, and a hard woodiness. Finish is long, balanced, enticing. Definitely enjoyable as a sipper; an interesting new direction.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
88,Ragtime Rye,,Craft Whiskey,44,"New York Distilling&#039;s 3 year old rye is made with a 72/16/12% mashbill (rye/corn/malt) and aged in 53-gallon barrels. The rye is organic and non-GMO. Nose is clean, rich with grassy, bitter rye aroma and a nice dash of mint. Mouth is smooth but assertive: bitter-minty, a bit oily, and the wood arrives near the end. Quite nicely balanced, delivers what a rye should, and would make an excellent cocktail as well.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
88,Teerenpeli Distiller’s Choice Karhi,43.0,Single Malt Finnish Whisky,87,"Peeling back the wrapper on a British chocolate bar studded with whole almonds, only to find an unexpected puff of spices; green cardamom pod and toasted fenugreek. Intriguing, never pungent. Given the spectrum of flavors in Madeira, this finish pushes the richness and complexity of the wine; raisin, coffee, and dried fruits make it sweet, concentrated, and mouth drawing. It relaxes to a toffee plateau with riffs on ripe date and coffee. The short coffee finish sees the chocolate return. (1,882 bottles) £60",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
88,Bruichladdich Octomore 7.3,63.0,Single Malt Scotch,180,"Every month seems to bring a new Octomore. Much is made of the peatiness of the malt used, but just as important is the way in which it is distilled and matured. It is these two aspects that give it sweetness and balance. This is minty, honey-sweet, with meadowsweet, some dried lavender, tinned peaches, and that hot sand note typical of Bruichladdich. The smoke is merely suggestive, giving an integrated power. 5 years old? Who knows what might happen next?",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
88,Midleton Very Rare 2015,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,145,"Master distiller Brian Nation is really getting into his stride now. This vintage has creamed coconut, Jersey milk, vanilla desserts, crystallized jellies, fresh orange peel, and dry spices. To drink it is to celebrate American oak; creamy, golden, polished, with peach, honey, sherbet, sugars, butter frosting, sponge cupcakes, almond biscuits, and Quaker oatmeal squares. Spices are reactivated at the swallow. You have a whole year to enjoy this until the next one arrives. Really, there’s no excuse.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
88,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 12 year old (2015 release),50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Many of the Birthday Bourbon releases are wood driven, and this one is particularly so. Very spicy, with warming cinnamon and cool mint. Roasted nuts, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), tangerine, and apricot emerge occasionally, along with a foundation of vanilla and caramel. Firm, resinous grip on the finish.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
88,The Dalmore Distillery Exclusive 2015,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,229,"Just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. Aged in a mixture of Madeira, muscatel, and port casks, with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm caramel, spiced orange, peach blossom, and black pepper on the complex nose. Nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet, then nutmeg, Jaffa orange, ginger, and milk chocolate emerge. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with sultanas, leather, a hint of plain chocolate, and lingering black pepper. £150",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
88,Royal Brackla 16 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar &amp; Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.

Richer and more complex than its younger sibling, with waxy peel, glacé cherries, sherry, sultanas, and custard. Silky smooth in the mouth, with marshmallows, milk chocolate, medium-sweet sherry, and stem ginger. Tingling spices allied to darkening chocolate and a touch of smoke in the medium to long finish. Finally, a fat, buttery note.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
88,Tomatin 36 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,780,"Tomatin has introduced a permanently-available 36 year old expression, and the first batch comprises 800 bottles. Matured in a combination of bourbon and <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks, this expression has not been chill-filtered. Milk chocolate and vanilla on the early nose, with background apricots, malt, and ginger. Ultimately citrus fruit and sherry. Good mouth-feel, lively sweet fruits, cloves, and more ginger on the palate. Long in the finish, drying slowly to fruity licorice and plain chocolate.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
88,Jim Beam Harvest Collection Triticale,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Triticale is a rye-wheat hybrid, so I’m expecting a rye-wheater hybrid bourbon. What I get is a screamer: spicy slice of a nose, hot cinnamon and sawn dry oak. Surprisingly light in the mouth, which is putting a smile on my face. Oak races through this, a spine coated with sweet grain, spicy notes, a bit of creaminess, and as the oak wraps up, I realize: no real rye bitterness. Cool stuff, a very good one. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
88,Kilkerran Work in Progress VII – Sherry,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Distilled in 2004, this 11 year old sherry cask-matured expression from Glengyle in Campbeltown is one of two final releases under the Work in Progress banner. 6,000 bottles have been released. Fragrant wood fires, fruity old leather, damp tweed, sherry, malt, and autumn berries on the nose. The palate is oily, rich, and rounded, with zesty spice, then peaches in syrup and sweet smokiness. The spices persist. The finish is long and warming with chili, licorice, and worn leather.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
88,Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Glenburgie,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"Up close, this displays more sherry and dried fruits, particularly raisins, currants, and sultanas, with a deep strawberry note and dollop of marmalade. Quite pungent, and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat. The juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness, but then there’s cake mix, gingersnaps, clove, and toasted spices, though it gravitates back to the marmalade. The finish has dry, bitter orange, ginger, and spice, with a hint of lime zest. Confident and characterful.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
88,The Clan Denny (distilled at Strathclyde) 9 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,75,"Need more whisky? Of course you do! Try this then. It was matured in a sherry butt following distillation in 2005: savory, beefy, roasted meat juices, brisket bark, balsamic vinegar, new strips of colored plasticine, and chocolatey Guatemalan coffee beans. A sherried, soft, and wispy opener with a whiff of ginger, clove, plum, charred notes, raisins, and black bun: this youngster can handle itself alright. A cloying, clingy finish with heat, sweet sherry notes, and spices. Give it plenty!",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
88,St. George Single Malt Lot 15,43.0,Craft Whiskey,90,"Ages range from 4 to 16 year old whiskeys; seven types of cask, 100% malt (mashed at Sierra Nevada Brewing). Solid, hefty malt nose with fruit dressing and a fleeting hint of baking spices. A much weightier, more serious whiskey this year; the malt is meaty, savory, with an edge from the wine oak, and even a hint of brine toward the end. I miss last year’s balance and relaxed nature, though; there’s an air of trying too hard here. (3,000 bottles)",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
88,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 005),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"“Tennessee bourbon” at 8 years, 3 months, and barrel proof. This and Batch 006 are the same whiskey, the same age, from different warehouse floors. Smooth sweet nose of oak and hot corn. Quite spicy on the tongue, hard-dancing oak vaults high in the mouth over a strong, sweet body. Solid oaky finish. Honest and foursquare as a Tennessee farmer; no surprises, but no disappointments either. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
88,Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Need you ask? An unmistakable classic and an exemplar of a blended Scotch whisky, famous around the world. Toffee, swirling caramel, whole almond, and mashed banana amid twisting white smoke. The palate has such poise, balance, and dexterity that it sets the standard for many less accomplished blends to aspire to. Conspicuously iconic, and the closest thing you will find to a complete whisky at this price.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
88,Buffalo Trace French Oak Barrel Aged,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Deeper, darker, more intense than the Barrel Head Aged expression. Toffee, pit fruit, Earl Grey tea, cinnamon, pencil shavings, and tobacco lead to a tannic, gripping finish. The French oak influence is tangible. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Fall 2015
88,1792 Sweet Wheat Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,33,"Barton 1792 distillery’s first-ever wheated bourbon, where the wheat replaces rye as the ‘spice’ ingredient (similar to Weller and Maker’s Mark). A sweet and fruity whiskey, with vanilla wafer, cotton candy, caramel custard, blackberry, and ripe peach. Soft oak spice and polished leather on the finish keep the sweetness in check. Very gentle in personality; a great starter bourbon.",John Hansell,Fall 2015
88,BenRiach 10 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,50,"This new member of the core range is wholly from stock produced by the distillery’s new(ish) owner. It has a gentle, sweet, honeycomb nose, with some banana, a little malt, and lemon freshness. The palate shows light honey/honeysuckle at the start and is well balanced, with maltiness and a signature spicy finish adding a dry counterpoint to the sweetness from the cask and a distillate with good weight. Good price as well. Lovely.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
88,Glenlivet 18 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"There’s no doubt that this is from Glenlivet; there’s still that pure combination of fruit and flowers, now given a little nudge toward a more concentrated expression: the flowers are dried and heathery, the fruits tinned pineapple, windfall apples. An added cedar/nutmeg note adds to the complexity. Liquorous and tongue-clinging with custard tart notes before the autumn fruits come through. A sense of the curtains being drawn and a settling in for the winter. Recommended.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
88,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Laphroaig) 14 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,142,"Big smoke. Smoked fish, in fact, with some linked oily elegance, along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality, adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. The palate is rootier, but always with this deep, clinging texture. As it moves it sweetens briefly, then comes creosote. Water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. It’s a barbecue in your mouth. Classic Laphroaig, in fact. £91",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
88,The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 40 year old 1975,,Single Grain Whisky,297,"This potent grain whisky from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears, green apples, vanilla sugar, polished horse chestnuts, and a waft of acetone. Neat, there is sweet fudge, runny caramels, and heat, but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa. At this strength, it really takes water generously, illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat. Dry, sweet vanilla pricked with orange seals the finish. There’s a sweet spot where this is deliciously drinkable. <em>(114 bottles) </em>£190",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
88,Thunder Bolt 100 Proof,50.0,Canadian,25,"The trend to higher-proof Canadian whisky continues. This massive gem from Highwood shows us how that benefits the whisky drinker. Toffee and spicy rye on the nose become toffee and sizzling hot pepper on the palate. While toffee lurks in the shadows, a lingering oaky base begins to assert itself. Sweetness and pepper subside as the wood emerges with a complexity not even hinted at on the nose. Enjoy it neat; love it with ginger ale. <em>(Canada only) </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
88,The Sovereign (distilled at Port Dundas) 26 year old 1988,,Single Grain Whisky,141,"You can feel the power, taut and straining, underneath the sweet nose of powdered sugar, sliced banana in custard, packing straw from tea chests, apple fritters, and sweet oak. There’s instant gratification, as this colossal whisky is fit to burst with honey, tropical fruits, apple, melon, and strawberry candy. Water adds shafts of sweetness to the nose and more jamminess to the palate. Made in Glasgow in the fall of 1988 and delivered at perfect drinking strength: they’ve bottled sunshine. <em>(154 bottles)</em> £90",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
88,Celtic Cask Ocht 8,46.0,Irish,354,"A 23 year old single malt from 1991 finished in French oak Ànima Negra casks from Mallorca, producing a dark, ruby colored whiskey. Rich and earthy: raisins, treacle, strawberry Jell-O, sawdust on dunnage floors, gingerbread, and traces of peppermint. Early creaminess is swept aside by intensely fruity waves of blackberry, blueberry, strawberry, grapefruit, and Seville orange that draw the mouth. Sweet Jaffa cake centers emerge later. Soft, never boisterous, and finishes with dry heat and fig paste (<em>334 bottles</em>). €325",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
88,Johnny Drum Private Stock,,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Plenty of color, and the nose says it ain’t lying. Sharp warehouse oak aroma puts an edge on an authoritative nose of honey, Indian pudding, spicy hard candy, and old-fashioned root beer, the not-too-sugary kind. Fiery and bold on the tongue as oak roars from start to finish, but the sweetness builds sip-by-sip: cornbread, buckwheat honey, King syrup, and a teasy bit of citrus peel. Long finish as the oak dies down. At this price, let’s keep it our secret. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
88,Woodford Reserve Rye,,Rye Whiskey,38,"Distilled from a relatively low-rye mash of 53% rye, 33% corn, 14% malt; true to Woodford Reserve form, a mingling of whiskeys distilled at Woodford and at Brown-Forman in Louisville. Nose of leather, cinnamon, rye snappiness, and hints of red raspberry. Hot and lean on the palate, spicy/sweet until rye’s bitter layering floats in, making for a dry finish as the oak comes on stronger. Balances drinkable and elegant quite nicely, and it’s real Woodford.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
88,Glenmorangie Tùsail,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,111,"Tùsail—apparently Gaelic for ‘originary’—is the sixth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition collection. It was distilled using floor-malted Maris Otter winter barley, once ubiquitous in the British brewing industry but now practically a rare breed. Oily on the nose, notably linseed, then becoming more floral. Cinnamon, ginger snaps, and faint new leather. Viscous on the palate, with poached pears, cloves, nutmeg, and polished oak. Drying, nutty oak in the finish. £76",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
88,Highland Park Odin 16 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,270,"Odin is the fourth and final release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. It has been aged in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry casks and refill hogsheads, with the former predominating. The nose yields cocoa powder, insistent spice, subtle sweet smoke, heather honey, and rum-and-raisin fudge. Rich and fruity on the palate, with lively dark spices, plus treacle and peat smoke. The lingering finish initially offers smoky sherry, then dries with licorice and oak. (17,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
88,Talisker 2003 Amoroso Finish Distillers Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,81,"This expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in <em>amoroso</em> sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. Fleeting green apples on the nose, before sweetening with figs, sultanas, red berries, and chili. Peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. Full-bodied on the palate, with spicy smoke, dark chocolate, peaches, and Jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the <em>amoroso</em> cask influence. Long and softly smoky in the finish, with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
88,Wemyss Malt Caribbean Crème (distilled at Invergordon) 1988,46.0,Single Grain Whisky,124,"A divine, lilting nose of exotic summery fruits that brings a smile to your face. Split papaya, fleshy mango, and candied peel join freshly squeezed OJ and sugar-dusted marshmallows. The thick, syrupy texture fizzes attractively on the palate with flavors of warm marmalade on buttered granary toast. After some mid-palate heat, there is flavored sherbet candy, mint, and burnt orange on the finish. Fruity, but happily not sugary sweet like some grains. (<em>171 bottles for Europe and Asia</em>) £85",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
88,Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Rye (barrel #A2-052),45.0,Canadian,60,"A single barrel release, selected by Julio’s Loch &amp; K(e)y society, focused very much on wood. An oak-forward nose features old split wood, pencil lead, and rye spice. On the palate the balance with oak improves slightly from the addition of brown sugar, vanilla, and cherry. Oak intensifies in the mid-palate, keeping some semblance of balance with the sweet undertones, but oak is clearly the star. A dry oak finish is the exclamation point at the end of this riff on wood. Sourced whiskey. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
88,Ranger Creek .36 Single Barrel (barrel #503),48.0,Craft Whiskey,79,"The .36 Small Caliber was one of the best young small-barrel bourbons I’ve ever had, so I was very much looking forward to this 3 year, 8 month old bottling from “traditional large barrels.” Aroma: like a 12 year old bourbon: oak spice, corn sweet. Not hot, spice and vanilla, smooth but oaky, with a light, flowing feel. A unique combination of youth and maturity that opens the “Texas whiskey” niche a bit wider. <em>(Spec’s exclusive)</em>",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
88,Paul John Peated Select Cask,,Indian Whisky,100,"Earthy notes, with plain chocolate nibs, malt drinks, and a little leather. There’s a subtle smoky air; nothing too astringent or overpowering. It’s great to try if you’re new to peaty whiskies or were put off by a peat colossus from Islay. Fig, plums, and soft prunes, though it’s mouth-puckering neat, so cut it down. Then, the fruit rounds out beautifully, allowing some gentle spices to shine through with some coffee bean notes at the end. Terrific stuff. £68",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
88,"Booker’s 2015-01 “Big Man, Small Batch,” 64.35%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"The first in a series of limited edition releases for 2015. Not as rich, thick, sweet, or deep as last year’s classic 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary bottling. This one’s lighter, drier, and with more spice. Cinnamon, mint, nutmeg, licorice root, citrus, and subtle botanical notes, all wrapped up in caramel and vanilla. Dry, pleasant finish. If the 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary bottling was an ideal <em>digestif</em>, this one is more suitable as an aperitif.",John Hansell,Summer 2015
88,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Ben Nevis) 15 year old Highland 1998 (cask #1589),,Single Malt Scotch,140,"A 15 year old port cask-matured Ben Nevis that is as genre-defying as it gets. Deep port notes combine with strong iodine, honey, and malt in an inviting nose. This whisky simply roars on the palate, with big jammy fruit combined with salt, iodine, and a dash of smoke. Everything comes together in the mid-palate, with an alluring core of ginger, honey, and malt. A long, flavorful finish wraps up a whisky with unique character and unmistakable appeal. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
88,I.W. Harper 15 year old,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Diageo has “brought I.W. Harper home” after years of absence from the U.S. market with this bottling and a base bottling (see below). The source is “new” Bernheim, but with a different mashbill from the base; this is 86% corn. Nose is warm corn and oak, with some spicy clove and cinnamon notes. Great medium-weight body and balance, palate repeats the nose, oaky-sweet finish; well-integrated whiskey. But my eyes pop at the price.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
88,Box The Pioneer,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,95,"Although around 3 years old, the maturity has been achieved by using smaller, 40-liter bourbon casks (65% unpeated/15% peated whisky), with the remainder coming from peated whisky matured in Swedish oak. This adds a depth of character to the nose, the peat meeting honeydew melon, vanilla, caramelized bananas, grist, malty notes, and crushed hazelnuts. Sweet toffee apple, citrus, flapjacks, crackling spices, and barley grains play over a swelling, creamy smokiness. Simply stunning, considering its age. 837 SEK",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
88,The Balvenie Single Barrel Traditional Oak 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,599,"Light gold, with good intensity and a more noticeable malty note than is common with this distillery, as well as touches of daffodil and dried honeycomb. The wood influence appears minimal to start with, but more vanilla creeps through in time; water brings out almond milk. Opens into clementine peel, pomelo, then cooked dessert apple. The palate is clean and forward; even slightly hot when neat. Remarkably assertive for a 25 year old.",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
88,Ben Nevis 15 year old 1998 (Cask #590),,Single Malt Scotch,140,"This 2014 bottling of Ben Nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. Distilled in June 1998, it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. Raisins, prunes, old polished leather, and roasted meat on the nose. The body is full, with the palate offering succulent dark berries, dates, raisins, and plain chocolate. Long and spicy in the finish, with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92",Gavin Smith,Spring 2015
88,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Miltonduff) 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,113,"Pale gold. Lightly floral and perfumed. The impression of honey on warm buttered scones. As it opens, so this gentle complexity grows, and gives a sense of some substance. Water reveals a hint of malt, fruit syrups, and pear blossom. The palate is creamy and needs a drop of water to reveal the acid/sweet flavor of white currant, and a hint of marzipan. A classic example of a light whisky—and a distillery—which could easily be overlooked. Don’t. £74",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
88,Label 5 Extra Rare 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,62,"Rather elegant blend, with aromas of woodworker’s bench, salted cashew, and dried banana chips, all backed by gentle bonfire smoke. Creamy caramel toffee, Victoria sponge, red currant, raspberry, and more oak build into a thick, luscious mouthful. Any smoke drifts away in the initial seconds. Toffee and fruit linger, making a very lengthy finish. A masterful top of the range blend from La Martinquaise. Well worth seeking out. €55",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
88,The English Whisky Co. “Lest We Forget” 1914 – 1918 Limited Edition,45.0,Single Malt English Whisky,76,"A creamy delight: rice pudding laden with swollen raisins, brown sugar melting on hot porridge (if this were scotch, it would be salt). It begins sweet, with a juicy fruitiness before a rodeo of spiciness bucks on the tip of the tongue. The texture is creamy and light but substantial enough to carry these big flavors. Dried lemon and double cream stretch out into a lengthy finish. A unique profile, but a fitting tribute. (1,499 bottles) £50",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
88,Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,45,"A ripe proposition, the fruit and the smoke locked tightly together like interwoven fingers. Peaches, melon, baked apple, fresh mango, and sugar strands with a supporting role of red berries. With a malt content exceeding two-thirds, the full-bodied palate is sweet as brown sugar, with mandarin tartness, apple, and red licorice meandering to a vinous finish of red berry fruit. With its cheeky Glasgow landmark on the label, this permanent addition to the GKS range is pure gallus.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
88,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 26 year old 1987 Cask # 2784,,Single Malt Scotch,230,"Peated whiskies definitely have a dropping off point where they become too old and tired, and the nose for this one would indicate it’s past its prime, with gravel, rubbery smoke, and raisin. On the palate it’s a different story, as ashy smoke combines with raisin and <em>rancio</em>, turning the peat age detriment into an asset. Strangely alluring, it’s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.  (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
88,Clynelish Select Reserve (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,800,"This Clynelish is notable as the first no age statement Special Release, and maturation took place in refill European and bodega European oak casks, along with first-fill, refill, and rejuvenated American oak casks. The nose is fresh and salty, with olives, pine, and lemongrass, then fruit notes ranging from citric to sweet. Oily on the palate, with those same citric and sweet fruits as the nose, plus cayenne pepper and vanilla. Spicy citrus fruits in the drying finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
88,Old Pulteney 1990 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,200,"An unusual vintage bottling of Old Pulteney, in that maturation occurred in a mix of American bourbon casks and Spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated whisky. The nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon, vanilla, and coconut appear, along with fleeting wood smoke. Intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate, lemon sorbet, and lively spices on the palate. Spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
88,Old Pulteney 40 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,2280,"Old Pulteney’s 40 year old comprises spirit from three sherry hogsheads and one bourbon barrel. Just 493 bottles of the distillery’s oldest expression to date have been released, offered at cask strength and not chill filtered. The nose is soft and fragrant, with peaches in syrup, toffee, cinnamon, and aerosol wood polish. Early intense orchard fruits on the palate, then nutmeg, cinnamon and black coffee. Long in the finish, with spicy oak tannins and Seville orange. Notably drying.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
88,Rosebank 1992 21 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,500,"Distilled in 1992, a year before Rosebank fell silent, this 21 year old expression was matured in refill American oak casks. 4,530 bottles have been released. The fragrant nose yields milk chocolate, peaches, apricots, nutmeg, and toffee bonbons. Spicy and mildly herbal on the palate, with icing sugar and a suggestion of dark chocolate. The finish is medium in length, fruity, with gentle spice, coffee, and developing oaky dryness.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
88,Mackmyra Moment Solsken,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,162,"Solsken comprises a parcel of smaller sherry and Swedish oak casks hand-picked by master blender Angela D’Orazio. The nose is like a basket of hot breakfast pastries, with honeycomb, tinned peaches, cinnamon, and hot teacakes with singed edges smoking from the grill. An amazing, golden taste that’s warm and soothing; sucked lozenges, mandarin segments, tame spices, and cobnut. The strength of the alcohol remains veiled in the shadows until the swallow…then it pounces. Mouth puckering finish of sharp fruit juices. €130",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
88,Wemyss Malts (distilled at Glenrothes) 1988 Aromatic Orange Tobacco,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,188,"Highly fragrant and citric, mixing dried and sweet orange peels, moist sultana fruitcake. Lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. Pretty and elegant in the mouth, where there’s orange barley water, mint, and crystallized ginger on top of a thick, honeyed delivery before the classic ‘Rothes sweet spices come through. Only a drop or two of water is needed. Recommended. £117",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
88,Kilkerran Work in Progress 6 Bourbon Matured,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,60,"As with its sherry wood-matured sibling, this 10 year old release comprises 9,000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. Lemongrass, a pinch of salt, wood smoke, and ginger snaps on the nose. Tropical fruits on the soft, slightly oily palate, with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. Nutty, drying, with mellow spice in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
88,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1,,Blended Scotch Whisky,91,"A smashing, rich sherry nose showcases rosehip, elderberry, scorched oak, pipe tobacco, roasted coriander seeds, and damp dunnage warehouses. The core of the flavor is the lush orange jelly hidden in McVitie’s Jaffa cakes, combined with clove, malt, treacle, dried mango, and ginger. Water draws out stronger performances from the malty notes, together with some red berry characteristics. Let it roll around the mouth, it’s terrific stuff (Batch 1, 148 bottles). £57",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
88,Adelphi (distilled at Glen Moray) 22 year old,55.0,Single Malt English Whisky,240,"Gold in color and sweet on the nose, with a little nudge of mash, stewed apples, and cobnuts. As it develops, the impression is of a polite garden tea at the minister’s: vanilla sponge, scones with cream and strawberry jam, with a background of lightly-turned earth. The palate continues equally sweetly and is lightly hot when neat. A glimpse of summer pleasures in wintertime.",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
88,Aultmore 25 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,636,"A wild aromatic opening — anise, sweet cicely, even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old, but not in a dominating fashion, rather just a framing device. Still fresh and acidic, with touches of a bridal bouquet, freshly baked warm sponge cake, walnut flesh, and, with water, a little bread-and-butter pudding. The acidity gives it a zippy, clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. Beautifully balanced. £400",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
88,Storm,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,40,"Treacle tarts, black bun, and polished antique furniture, with fainter accents of dark chocolate, espresso, and delicate smoke flowing freely from the glass. Densely structured palate. Initially, chocolate-coated coffee beans, then it blossoms into dried fig, date, with a developing deep, tangy chocolate orange note, fading to dusty cocoa like the memory of a warm embrace. Not to be confused with Cutty Sark, this Storm is bottled by the Whisky Shack Company.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
88,The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at North of Scotland) 1971,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,262,"The North of Scotland distillery (formerly Strathmore distillery) was a neighbor of Cambus and operated from 1957-1980 in Clackmannanshire. Bottlings are few and far between. This one is quite forward. Apple peelings, baked apricot, cinnamon, nutmeg, sherry notes with oak wood, beef stock, and adhesives. It tastes sweet, vibrant, and juicy with red berry fruits, rosewater, strawberry cream soda, cherryade, and cough linctus. A slightly bitter finish punctures the juiciness. (<em>310 bottles</em> <em>for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan) </em>£165",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
88,Kentucky Owl Bourbon Batch No. 1,,Bourbon/Tennessee,170,"Good nose: fresh-ground corn, warm oak, and light cinnamon. Impressively friendly even at full proof: corn pudding, sun-warmed oak plank, rich and nuanced cinnamon spice, a powerful engine running strong. A splash of water brings out some sweet berries, revs up the oak and pulls out more spice, and opens up the finish into a full-throated roar of oak, corn, and sweet citrus. This is what happens when you let a good barrel run at full throttle. Sourced whiskey. <em>(Kentucky only)</em>",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
88,Celtic Cask Dó,46.0,Irish,311,"Powerfully smoky, this one. Driftwood bonfires with a distinctive salinity to the smoke. Neglected fruit bowls. The tannins and red wine influences of cherry, apple, peach, and mango attempt to match the intensity of the burning engine of peat. Sooty embers diminish, leaving cherry-studded fudge to finish. Wonderful design touches inspired by the Book of Kells on this peated single malt from Cooley finished in red wine casks from Ànima Negra. (349 bottles) €250",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
88,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old bourbon from floor #1,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.



Soft and sweet, oozing caramel, honeyed vanilla, and gentle, ripe orchard fruit. Soft, gently sweet finish. Not the most complex of the three in this experiment, but it’s very easy-going and soothing on the palate. A nice pairing for a cigar, where the sweet notes will marry nicely with the cigar’s dried spice. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Fall 2014
88,Exclusive Malts 2001 (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,120,"A sweet start, then a sudden blast of fresh, menthol-like toothpaste (pleasant) before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits (again, nice), a mashy note, then violet-accented smoke. Water adds some elegance and weight. This sweetness continues on the palate, where there’s toffee, raisin, ripe fruits, and slow-burning peatiness, fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate. The finish is all hot peppered mackerel. Recommended. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
88,Master of Malt Darkness! Clynelish 16 year old Oloroso Cask Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,126,"Darkness! is a range of cask strength single malts which have been finished for 3 months in 50-liter first-fill <em>oloroso</em> or <em>Pedro Ximénez</em> casks. Waxy on the nose, with dates, prunes, cherries, cocoa powder, window polish, and finally vanilla. Warm and spicy on the palate, with sweet sherry, hot chocolate, intense tropical fruit notes, and cloves. The fruit becomes more citric in the finish; nutty, with clove oil. £75",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
88,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1985 (Cask #2591),,Single Malt Scotch,480,"A refill sherry hoggie has given a classic walnut color, and indeed notes of that nut as well. Here’s Glenfarclas at its most dense, with savory, sun-dried tomato-like edges and sandalwood. The mouth is elegant with a little heat, the sherry giving roasted almond, sweet plump dried fruits, and dried flowers. Water brings out lightly gripping tannins (but, again, not aggressively) and good layering. Similar to the ’87. £285",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
88,Glenglassaugh Massandra Connection 35 year old Madeira Wood Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,665,"Glenglassaugh initially imported Massandra wine casks from the Crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes, and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. In 2014, two Massandra cask finishes were released. Distilled in 1978, the Madeira-finished nose yields dates, sultanas, stewed fruit, caramel, a hint of smoke, and spices. Smooth on the palate, with apricots, cocoa powder, oak, and lots of spice development. The softly-oaked finish is lengthy, citric, and spicy. £395",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
88,Bastille 1789,40.0,Blended French Whisky,30,"Master distiller Jean-Marc Daucourt uses French wheat and malted barley in his distillations and ages his spirit in different woods, noticeably Limousin oak. The nose brings marmalade, newly unfurled bracken, sanded wood on a workshop bench, light pepper, dried apricot, and pineapple. It’s a well-balanced dram showing marmalade sweetness, fruit pastilles, lime zest, and ginger, which adds to the toasted, spicy tingle. The creamy mouthfeel concludes with the spices in retreat, leaving an orange hum. Some kind of wonderful.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
88,Overeem Port Cask Matured #29,60.0,Australian Whisky,318,"This is more reassuringly tawny than the standard strength, and the alcohol strength oozes out of the glass. The nose is cleaner and fresher than the standard, with maraschino cherry, freeze-dried raspberries, white chocolate, and tamarind pulp. Neat sips showcase rich dark fruits of blackcurrant, black cherry, and dense chew bars. A dash of water amplifies the sweet fruits with heavenly, dusty aromatics and red, fleshy fruits. Yours for a pretty penny. £189",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
88,Breaker Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"This bourbon is a blend of whiskeys aged a minimum of 5 years, with part of that time spent in California&#039;s Central Coastal hills. Breaker leads with a strong oak nose supported by cinnamon and caramel. On the palate, the maritime impact is there: it’s softer and less oaky, with a good balance of cinnamon, caramel, and a touch of clove. Breaker is a very restrained and understated bourbon, but that’s also what makes it so damn likable. Sourced whiskey.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
88,Lac’ Holl Vieil Or,42.0,French Whisky,65,"Gilbert Holl brewed beer in Ribeauvillé, but then began to distill his local malted barley to produce the first whisky from Alsace. This 8 year old has an attractively perfumed nose of Parma violets, dunnage warehouse, and wood smoke, with top notes of apricot and peach. Plunge into a thick, fruity mouthfeel of melting orange sorbet flecked with lime zest, and a moreish, mouth-coating finish of tropical fruits. Punching above its weight, this is highly recommended (<em>Alsace only</em>) €49",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
88,Virgil Kaine Ginger Infused Bourbon,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,27,"Ginger may not be the first flavor that leaps to mind when you think flavored whiskey, but then you realize how common the combination is: Jack and Ginger, Jameson and Ginger, and now Virgil Kaine. Fresh ginger is unmistakable on the nose and the secret to this whiskey’s success. On the palate, fresh ginger seamlessly integrates with oak, black pepper, and clove spice. Underneath is sweet vanilla that helps keep everything in balance. A well-executed and savvy flavored whiskey.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
88,The Famous Grouse 40 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,3378,"Legendary master blender John Ramsay handpicked the casks for this whisky, and the job was completed by his successor, Gordon Motion. Puffy marshmallows, nougat, fallen orchard fruit, green cardamom, and clove; it’s like all the threads pull together harmoniously. A lucid concentration of fruit mingles on the tongue, preceding flavor advancement through spearmint, menthol, light peat smoke, and burning orange oils. Sit back as it heads toward a spicy tingle of ginger, apple, and scorched coriander seed. Deservedly famous. £2,000",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
88,Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel Commemorative Edition,,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Bolder, with more spice than other Elmer T. Lee single barrel offerings I’ve tried over the years. A bit more vibrant too. Fresh notes of cinnamon, vanilla, wood shavings, ground black pepper, clove, subtle tobacco, and a hint of nutmeg on a bed of caramel and honeyed orchard fruit. Firm, warming, spicy finish. Most releases I’ve had were mellower and smoother (the 90<sup>th</sup> Birthday release comes to mind), but this is very dynamic and vibrant.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
88,Springbank 12 year old Cask Strength 2014 release,,Single Malt Scotch,76,"This is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength Springbank to appear, being bottled early in 2014. Some of the component whisky was matured in <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks. The nose blends maritime notes with Christmas cake fruits, vanilla pods, and overt sherry. Viscous in the mouth, with cowsheds and soft peat smoke, plus spice, caramel, and a hint of sweet sherry. The no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke, root ginger, and freshly-dug peat. £45",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
88,Hazelburn Rundlets & Kilderkins 10 year old 3rd release,,Single Malt Scotch,101,"This bottling of triple-distilled Hazelburn comprises spirit produced in 2003 and matured in unusually small casks known as rundlets and kilderkins. Malt, chocolate, and honey figure on the nose, along with a contrasting marine note in the background. Unctuous and rich on the palate, with soft fruit, almonds, brittle toffee, and lots of spice. The finish is lengthy and earthy, with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea salt. £60",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
88,Douglas Laing Directors’ Cut (distilled at Rosebank) 21 year old cask #10146,,Single Malt Scotch,676,"This example of Rosebank was distilled in March 1992, a year before the distillery’s closure, and bottled in December 2013. The cask yielded 141 bottles. The nose is light and mildly floral, with ripe pears, honey, and vanilla. Firm and fruity on the surprisingly full palate, with a sprinkling of white pepper, plus summer berries and caramel. Tropical fruit, soft spices, and benign oak in the finish, with a final flourish of licorice. £400",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
88,Girvan Patent Still 25 year old,42.0,Single Grain Whisky,422,"William Grant is making pioneering efforts to develop Girvan as a single grain whisky brand, with more to come. The aromas beckon with masses of buttery vanilla notes, fresh apple, cinnamon stick bundles, dark peel, and chocolate pralines. The creamy, unctuous texture packs in white chocolate, citrus, lime, chewy caramels, and pineapple, with soft American oak characteristics. Long finish of vanilla, ground cinnamon, and mint. One of the tastiest grains on the market: expensive, but still, it’s patently very good. £250",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
88,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Standard Stave Drying Time,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Well-defined flavors and clean on the palate. Wood is the driving influence here, showing plenty of dried spice throughout with a dry, resinous finish. The spice notes are accompanied by a layer of caramel, dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg), and subtle orchard fruits. The dry oak notes overstay their welcome for balance. Otherwise, it’s a very pleasant whiskey. Price per 375 ml.

88,Auchentoshan 1975,,Single Malt Scotch,820,"This 38 year old Travel Retail-exclusive expression has been aged in bourbon casks, and not chill filtered. It follows an initial batch of the same vintage, released in 2011. The nose is perfumed, with a resin note and developing vanilla and caramel popcorn. Demerara sugar and oak. Very fruity on the palate, with oranges and lemons, emerging spices, and benign oak. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. The additional maturation has given the fruity elements a greater profundity. <i>(500 bottles)</i>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
88,Wemyss Malts Merchant’s Mahogany Chest (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1991,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,95,"The latest single cask expression of 1991 Glen Scotia from Wemyss Malts has been matured for 22 years in a sherry butt, which yielded 807 bottles. The nose provides sherry and cigar boxes, cherries, sultanas, raisins, orange peel, plum pudding, and finally warm leather. Full bodied, with sherry on the palate, plus brine, dried fruit, bitter coffee, and polished old, dark oak. Medium to long in the fruity finish, with salt, plain chocolate, and wood polish notes. £105",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
88,Old Pulteney Navigator,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Navigator honors Old Pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. The expression carries no age statement, is non-chill filtered, and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose features vanilla, sherry, American cream soda, ginger, orange peel, and cocoa powder. Complex. Mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate, with more oranges, and cocoa. Dries slowly, slightly powdery, with persistent citrus fruit, and a hint of brine. Value Pick.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
88,Collingwood 21 year old Rye,40.0,Canadian,70,"In 2013, the cavernous warehouses of the Canadian Mist distillery in Collingwood, Ontario gave up a single fifty-barrel batch of 100% malted rye. It had been resting there since 1991. Sweet, with the familiar flavors of rye bread, a juicy, joyful thrum burbles to a silken smooth surface before diving deep again only to rebound with warming spices, white pepper, and a pithy citrus pull. Indulgently creamy, Collingwood 21 defines “smooth.” Rich, flavorful, and oh, so mellow.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
88,Rock Town Arkansas Rye Batch #1,46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Bitter, oily, medicinally minty rye in the nose, and a pleasant undercurrent of oaky vanilla. Brisk, hot rye mixes furiously with wood notes, pear and berry esters, and a light grainy sweetness; a madly busy whiskey that’s quite fun on the palate. The finish is minty and grassy, wrapped in oak, but somewhat quick. Interesting, and delicious.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
88,New York Honey Whiskey,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,45,"Finger Lakes Distilling rye whiskey infused with Catskill Mountains honey. The nose is grassy, oily rye whiskey, and the honey’s there mostly as a rounder, richer character enhancer. It’s much more present in the mouth, merging very nicely indeed with the rye. There’s authentic, delicious honey flavor here, and it’s balanced beautifully as the rye keeps it from being sticky or oversweet. An excellent and interesting flavored whiskey; up there with the best examples of the category.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
88,Sortilège Prestige 7 years old,,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,45,"A rye-fueled, horse-drawn sleigh ride to a backwoods Quebec sugar shack springs instantly to mind. Vanilla, toasted wood, brittle maple snow taffy, and the woody, crystalline granularity of maple sugar in a velvety smooth whisky base. Hot pepper, wood smoke, and green maple bark fold into a steaming cauldron of whisky barrel notes. The first few days’ maple syrup is the richest and that alone is what blender Michel Marcil uses for this ultra-premium maple whisky. (<i>Quebec only (dang!))</i> C$50",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2014
88,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 125,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"These releases are all the same age, but this one tastes the oldest, and in a higher weight class. Deep and dark in personality. Chewy, with some tobacco and roasted nuts thrown in the mix, along with the toffee, dark pit fruit, oak spice, and leather on the finish. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
88,Glenrothes Elders’ Reserve,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,158,"As befits an elder of the church, this has a serious attitude, which with the youngest component being 18 years old isn’t a surprise. Full-bodied, but with elegance, not bludgeoning power, this is a refined Rothes: malted barley, creamy oak, oxidative depths. Sweet with stewed plums and red fruit. The palate is unctuous with little hints of geranium and becomes slightly funky with water, though I’d go neat to get the full effect of bitter orange and sweet honeycomb.<i> (Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>€99",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
88,Glenrothes Manse Reserve,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,54,"The youngest of the Manse Brae triumvirate, and also the freshest. Here is Rothes at its liveliest, with sweet cereal and the typical spiciness of the distillery undercut by citrus peels, dessert apples, and hot malted milk. On the tongue it is quite delicate, but it is how it behaves mid-palate which is the killer, just stopping and allowing the fruits to liquefy in the center of the tongue. Fantastic price as well.<i> (Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>€40",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
88,Ragnvald,,Single Malt Scotch,539,"Pear drops, green apples, lots of toffee, and more spice on the nose than in the Sigurd expression; also fresher and fruitier. Voluptuous mouthfeel, with sherry, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, and a wisp of fragrant smoke. Toffee remains in the finish, with notes of cocoa powder, smoky oak, and citrus spice. Very well balanced.(<i>Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>€400",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
88,The Macallan Coronation (Spanish Oak Cask #190952),,Single Malt Scotch,567,"Bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the American oak version, this is deeply resinous, with clove, shoe leather, high-grade engine oil—an Aston Martin workshop, not a back alley garage—alongside dried fruits. Similar in tone to some old Caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and Friar’s Balsam. The tannins yield slightly, showing chicory and raisin. ‘Old style’ Macallan, and another which, while strong, is best neat. £350",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
88,Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Tormore) 2005,,Single Malt Scotch,78,"Is this bottled by Duncan Taylor or Ben &amp; Jerry’s? Ludicrous amounts of white/milk chocolate and macadamia nut, with green fennel underneath. With water, it opens into dark chocolate chunks (see what I mean?) and cappuccino. One sip makes you worry you’re putting on weight, such is the thickness of its impact. Okay, it’s more about the wood rather than the distillery, but you can’t deny that it puts a smile on your face. Completely bonkers and somehow wonderful. £49",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
88,Wemyss Malts Salted Caramels (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1991,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,145,"Just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask Glen Scotia have been released by Wemyss Malts, with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. Fleetingly, very sweet, crunchy apples on the nose, then caramel, milk chocolate, sherbet dips, plus a hint of brine. The palate is sweet and peppery, with spicy toffee, grapefruit, melon, and walnuts. The finish is medium in length, spicy, with table salt in the tail. £90",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
88,Elijah Craig 12 year old Single Barrel,47.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"Very much in the Elijah Craig style: thick and chewy, with layers of toffee, molasses, and vanilla cream. Notes of caramel-nut fudge, cinnamon bun, and blackberry brandy keep it fun. There’s just the right amount of dried oak spice on the finish to round things out. Very good, solid, affordable bourbon. <i>(Capital City Package exclusive.)</i>",John Hansell,Winter 2013
88,Black Ridge,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,32,"Rich aroma of vanilla and corn, crimped and spiced with oak. Authoritative strength, full and solid; sharp oak and dry mint, with vanilla and cornbread arriving toward the finish, which is the only jarring note. There's too much woody bite at the close. Still, very much a sipping whiskey; don't put anything but a bit of water or a single cube of ice in this. By far, the best of the Total Wine store brands I've received. Sourced whiskey. <i>

</i>",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
88,McCarthy's Oregon Single Malt (Batch W13-01),,Craft Whiskey,55,"3 year old peated malt whisky, aged in Oregon oak. Rich nose of peat—burning leaves, a touch of sweet diesel—and fresh oak. There's no stinting on the peat; it's young, it's in your face. Whiskey to stand toe-to-toe with Portland's hopped-to-blazes beers. Not just peat: creamy malt makes a solid floor and an exit that may be the most complex part of the experience. Refined for a 3 year old. Limited annual release.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
88,Paddy Centenary Edition,,Irish,101,"This marks the biggest identity change since Clark Kent morphed into Superman; the plodding Paddy brand has been reshaped for this limited edition into a young and feisty pot still whiskey. It's meant to recreate the taste of 100 years past, which begs the question: what happened? This has raspberry, violet, and pear, but there's a mysterious stranger at the heart, a pepper and oily center: a bit like a gypsy in a wedding dress. But it scrubs up well. €75",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
88,Berry’s Own Selection (distilled at Jura) 1976,,Single Malt Scotch,322,"This expression of Jura is by leading London wine and spirits merchant Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd, and was bottled in the company’s Berry’s Own range at 35 years of age after maturation in sherry hogshead #889. The nose offers sweet sherry and caramel, sultanas, cinnamon, and rum baba, with an elusive wisp of smoke. Full-bodied, very fruity on the palate, with mixed spices, pine cones, and old sherry notes. The finish is long, nutty, and luxurious. £200",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
88,Arran Malt 16 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30

percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2013
88,Mackmyra Special No. 10,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"It’s well possible that this will be the last of the Special range, and if so, then it is both a bit of a whisper of an ending, and a highly pleasant one. This is as easygoing and gentle as Mackmyra ever gets. Very much a sweet and savory delight, this is a soft dessert whisky with banana and cream in evidence. That’s before someone pours the salt pot over it. Even then the caramel and fruit battle back. Highly enjoyable.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
88,Jim Beam Distiller’s Masterpiece Sherry Cask Finished,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"“Extra-aged” bourbon finished in <i>Pedro Ximénez</i><i> </i>sherry casks. The third Distiller’s Masterpiece release, the previous two being over a decade ago. The PX sherry is certainly evident, with its lush, dark fruit (raisin, prune, ripe plum), marmalade, and

layered dark sugars (toffee, molasses, maple syrup). A peppering of spices (cinnamon, allspice, vanilla) and dry, resinous oak round out the palate. Certainly a mood whiskey. Perhaps with a cigar after dinner? <i>(distillery only)</i>",John Hansell,Fall 2013
88,Jim Beam Signature Craft 12 year old,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Nicely balanced, with interwoven soft vanilla, cinnamon, and citrus, all on a bed of light toffee and caramel. More subtle notes of marzipan, tropical fruit, and soft oak add complexity. Traditional in style, with a friendly demeanour. A good bourbon to have on hand, as it is very versatile. I would have preferred this bottled at 45-50&#37;, but this will do just fine as it is. A new regular bottling.",John Hansell,Fall 2013
88,Paul John Brilliance,46.0,Indian Whisky,,"Paul John is taking its entry into the world of single malt very seriously, and very slowly but surely. After two single cask offerings to find its range, Brilliance and Edited are its first general releases. Brilliance is unpeated and is a delight: rich, full, young but not immature, and with lime and citrus Starburst chews, sweet candy, and some icing sugar, it trips across the palate. Conclusive proof that Amrut isn’t the only Indian game in town.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
88,Te Bheag Blended Whisky,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"Pronounced “Te Veg,” this has its roots in the Isle of Skye, and as there’s only one distillery there it’s highly likely that the odd

drop of Talisker has found its way into the mix. Whether it has or not, this is stirring stuff, non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. As you might expect, it’s rugged with brine and chili, giving it a distinctive spice edge. But the delivery is a caramel fudge delight, with luxury chocolate praline in there too.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
88,Forty Creek Copper Pot Reserve,43.0,Canadian,,"This “amped-up” version of John K. Hall’s signature Barrel Select is not so much better as it is bigger and bolder. Cloves, ginger, and cinnamon burst over creamy rich butterscotch and searing red pepper, restrained only by dry rye grain and bitter orange. The initial fireworks complete, figgy dark fruit and nutty milk chocolate swirl capriciously over fragrant spring flowers, soft vanilla, and delicate herbal maple syrup. Dramatic and delightful. ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
88,Dailuaine 16 year old Flora & Fauna,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"These days the mighty Mortlach is a known quantity, but Diageo’s two other meaty sites—Benrinnes and Dailuaine—remain in the shadows. This is big, boisterous, and sherried, but there’s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two; at Dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside Seville orange, treacle, and the inevitable raisin and date. There are nods to PX sherry as well. Every bit as good as Mortlach.  £43",Dave Broom,Summer 2013
88,Santis Alpstein IV Edition,48.0,Swiss,,"Whisky Advocate is moving out into the unknown, turning over the rocks and discovering beautiful and unfamiliar creatures like this one. In tiny distilleries in Switzerland, Sweden, and, er, Swansea, they're throwing the rule book up in the air and creating new whiskies based on how it falls. This has spent four years in a beer barrel and then a year in a port cask, and it's fabulous. Think licorice, aniseed, and cherry-flavored soda. Then add cream, fruit…and yowza! €35",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
88,Century Reserve 21,40.0,Canadian,,"Taken slow and easy, this 100% corn whisky tells a story, one you have to suss out gradually. It’s big and flavorful with hints of sweet corn, cow barn, and spices, followed by peppermint, lime peel, lilacs, and oak. Then it turns fresh, creamy, and alive with invigorating pepper and just a smidgen of sweetness, blending lemon drops, vanilla, and barley sugar until the story resolves satisfyingly on your palate. (Canada only) C$40",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
88,Crown Royal Maple Finished,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"With a rich nose like warm maple syrup, it’s hard to miss that this is a flavored whisky. But the maple smells real, like breakfast in a Vermont diner. It’s also good that it’s not sickly sweet and thick; the mouthfeel is like good Crown with maple flavor, not a big wad of syrup. So if you like flavored whiskies, bring on the Canadian cocktails and ice cream: this is the good stuff.  ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
88,Johnnie Walker The Spice Road,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Somebody at Diageo has been taking a lot of interest in the Johnnie Walker range of late, what with the revamp of the core range and now a regular stream of special releases. This is the first of a series for Travel Retail only, but it takes the Johnnie Walker themes — vanilla, spice, and honey, with wispy peat and smoke — and adds savory spice to the earthiness. But there are some very young notes in this. ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
88,Arran Premium Sherry Single Cask (Cask 1979),,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Isle of Arran distillers is now offering exclusive bottlings in the U.S. along the same lines as those already available in the UK, starting with 16 year old single cask, cask strength variants. Arran Premium Sherry Single Cask #1979 displays milk chocolate, vanilla, new leather, wood polish, and butterscotch on the nose. More vanilla in time. The palate is richly sherried, with espresso, fruit loaf, nutmeg, and old wood. Lively spices persist in the lingering, leathery finish.  ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
88,Balblair 1997,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Following the initial release of a 1997 vintage Balblair in 2007, a second edition has now been launched, with the spirit in question having benefited from an additional five years’ maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Fresh, light, and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches, pear drops, sweet apples, plus vanilla and wood putty. The palate features lots of succulent soft fruits, milk chocolate, honey, and spice. The finish is medium in length, and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55 ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
88,"Elements of Islay Pl1 (distilled at Bruichladdich, Port Charlotte style)",60.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Part of an ongoing series, and the first appearance of Port Charlotte. This ain’t shy. Assertive with banana, roasted red pepper, paprika, and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. The palate has blazing heat, but also oiliness and real density. The peat doesn’t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque, impenetrable. Even water cannot unlock it. Rooty and tarry, this is not a dram for the fainthearted. £65 (500 ml)",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
88,Glengoyne 18 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This variant of Glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range, and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” Milk chocolate, vanilla, melon, and grapefruit on the nose, with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. The palate is rich and well rounded, with cinnamon and ginger, almonds, orange marmalade, sweeter sherry, and caramel. Lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish.  £70",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
88,The Macallan Sienna,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,103,"When approached from light to rich, you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. Here are stewed black cherries, red plums, and blueberries, but with the purity and freshness of Amber and Gold. The mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots, candle wax, resin, allspice, peels, those perfumed fruits, and the whiff of an artist’s palette. The tannins are supple. Best with water on the side. £66",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
88,Old Pulteney WK217,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"WK217 is the latest in Pulteney’s Travel Retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. This expression has been matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak sherry butts. Fig rolls, black treacle, sultanas, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Finally, milk chocolate. Smooth and oily on the palate, with soft spices, before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. The finish is relatively long, with sherry and spice, then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
88,Pike Creek 10 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"This soft, fruity luxury is a stablemate to Corby’s Lot No. 40, and another resurrected member of the once-lost Canadian Whisky Guild. Hiram Walker’s distillery, where Pike Creek is made, is one of the largest in North America. However, the owner, Pernod-Ricard, encourages creativity and innovation as well as product reliability. Gingery dark fruits mingle with canned fruit and clean oak, while a peppery nuttiness lingers below soft red wine and white grapefruit. C$40",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
88,Grant’s 25 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,294,"I was surprised to find that Grant’s blends were noticeable by their absence in the U.S. But with the purchase of Tuthilltown in New York and Tullamore Dew in Ireland, that is slowly changing; and here&#039;s proof. Beautiful, honeyed, rich, but the 40% ABV makes it the whisky equivalent of a radio DJ cutting off “Freebird” before the solo at the end. Still great, and indeed better than most competition, but not the classic it could be.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
88,Giant French Oak Barrel 19 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"My favorite of the two [Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel]. Surprisingly sweet, with layers of caramel, butterscotch, nougat, and subtle creamy vanilla.  This whiskey defies its age. A blend of dried spice on the nose and the finish of the palate balances the sweetness. A very enjoyable (and drinkable) whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
88,"Arran ‘The Devil’s Punch Bowl,’ 52.3%",,Single Malt Scotch,130,"6,660 bottles of The Devil’s Punch Bowl have been released, and the component whiskies come from 24 casks filled between 1996 and 2006. They include a number of sherry butts, and some peated spirit is included in the mix. The nose offers soft, mellow malt, dried fruits, and milk chocolate. Silky smooth and deceptively drinkable at full strength, the palate is nutty and notably fruity, with ginger and brittle toffee. A hint of barbecue sauce in the sweet finish.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
88,Longrow Red,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 11 year old bottling of Longrow from Springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9,000 bottles are available. The nose offers buttery smoked haddock, coal tar soap, citrus fruit, and new leather, with background notes of soft peat. Mouth coating, with rich peat on the palate, plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. Long in the finish, with persistent peat smoke and, finally, red currants. £50",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
88,Old Pulteney WK499,52.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is the second travel retail-exclusive expression of Old Pulteney to use the registration of a Wick fishing vessel in its name, in this case the Isabella Fortuna, a herring drifter dating from 1890. This expression bears no age statement and was matured in bourbon casks. Floral and fragrant on the nose, with honey, vanilla, zest of lemon, and a hint of salt. The palate features fresh fruit salad, coconut, and sherbet liveliness. Summery. Medium length in the spicy finish. £35 (1 liter)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
88,Kornog Taouarc,,French Whisky,77,"Of all the releases I&#039;ve tasted from this distillery, this version is the one that most resembles Glann ar Mor, stepping a big step away from the peat and toward the sort of earthy fruitiness that is typified by Glann ar Mor. There are more exotic fruits here too—kiwi and mango, perhaps—and something reminiscent of green salad. Surprisingly refreshing. €60",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
88,Auchroisk 30 year old Special Release 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The original Singleton, seemingly discarded as a single malt, rides back defiantly with this bottling. The start shows cherrystone, but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut, varnish, and sweet leather, but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. The palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water, which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. Old yes, oak yes, but layered and good.  ",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
88,BenRiach Authenticus 25 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,195,"Though sounding more like a character out of Asterix than a whisky, Authenticus is the code for the peated arm of the ever-expanding BenRiach portfolio. It’s the smoke that you notice first, typically Highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. It’s not a bludgeoning smoke however, because BenRiach’s inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. In other words, it has maturity. The key here is balance and harmony. £124",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
88,Black Grouse Alpha Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Arguably the most successful of the Famous Grouse extensions (well, the competition includes Snow Grouse, for Pete's sake!), the Black Grouse brought ever-popular peat into the mix, a move that was followed by a peatier version of Johnnie Walker Black Label. The label says this is richer and peatier, and it is. But this scores most for a chicory/coffee and liquid licorice undercarpet that makes it very palatable indeed. Neat over ice. (Travel Retail exclusive)€33",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
88,Double Barrel Ledaig/Bowmore,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts. This is a big, rich, oily, and peaty whisky, suggesting both the Ledaig—the peated version of Tobermory and often a bland malt—and the Bowmore—capable of big smoke notes when it wants to—are firing on all cylinders. There's not much subtlety to it, but it's enjoyable all the same.€40",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
88,Woodford Reserve Double Oaked,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Woodford’s first permanent line extension. Aged in two barrels with different toast and char amounts.  More visceral than the standard Woodford Reserve, with a darker personality, extra wood spice, and a nice sweet foundation. Notes of cinnamon stick, dark berried fruit, roasted nuts, caramel, creamy vanilla, and polished leather.",John Hansell,Summer 2012
88,The Dalmore Cromartie,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,156,"The Dalmore Cromartie was distilled in 1996 and has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The release is limited to 7,500 bottles. A floral nose with cocoa powder and warm leather, along with hand-rolling tobacco and gingery, citrus notes. Rich and elegant sherry notes on the palate, with soft, smoky treacle and dark chocolate-covered orange candy. The finish is long and spicy, majoring on cinnamon, with more dark chocolate, overripe orange, and a hint of licorice. £100",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
88,Glenmorangie Artein,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Artein is the third release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition range, with ‘artein’ being Gaelic for stone. The expression comprises two-thirds 15 year old and one-third 21 year old whisky, finished in ‘Super Tuscan’ wine casks. Briefly pear drops, then vanilla on the nose, with developing peaches and apricots, shot through with mild ginger. Viscous, mouth-coating, intense, dark fruits, spice, aniseed, and late onset of cloves and blackcurrant cough medicine on the palate. The finish is fruity, long, and herbal.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
88,Lagavulin Distillers Edition 1995,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,77,"It’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like Lagavulin to go into a different direction. Indeed, even PX casks, from the sweetest fortified wine of all, can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character, just give it a raisined coating. The creosote turns to tar and licorice, while there’s Syrah-like sootiness, and damson. This release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it, though I still prefer my Lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
88,Springbank Rundlets & Kilderkins,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Springbank has released a limited edition of 9,000 bottles of whisky distilled in November 2001, matured in small casks (traditionally known as rundlets or kilderkins), and bottled in January 2012. The small casks have left an impression of accelerated maturity, with coal smoke, cloves, young oak, and caramel on the rich nose. The palate is big and bold, with a sprinkling of salt, then more youthful wood, milk chocolate, and honey, while the finish is long and slightly tarry. £57",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
88,Bakery Hill Cask Strength Peated Classic Single Malt,60.0,Australian Whisky,,"If you've tasted any Connemara Irish peated whiskey you'll know and love this. This whisky is the most improved in the Bakery Hill range, so that now with water the peat weaves patterns round the standard green apple, honey, and vanilla heart of the malt. Australian peat is very different to that of Scotland, and here it is wispy, smoky, and sweet. A$115",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
88,The Clan Denny Single Grain (distilled at Cambus) 35 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,,"Very typical of old grain whiskies: light in body and floral, with soothing vanilla and a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin in syrup, honey-kissed pineapple, banana, and coconut cream). The better examples, like this one, are not dominated by dry oak on the finish. Subtle spices (ginger, cocoa powder) add intrigue. Old grain whiskies are hard to find but worth exploring. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",John Hansell,Summer 2012
88,Corsair Triple Smoke,40.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Three batches of malt, smoked separately with peat, cherry wood, and beech. The nose is Islay-reminiscent peat, with some beech bacon under it, but the top is all cherry; very rewarding. For all the nose, the mouth is relatively mild; mostly juicy malt up front, then opening to the peat fire in the middle, the beech crowding around the sides, and the cherry floating overtop like a good pipe tobacco. Smooth, smoky finish. Compelling.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2012
88,Connemara Bog Oak,,Irish,,"Bog oak is oak preserved in Irish peat bogs for 5,000 years, and for this whiskey, cask heads made of it are used for maturation. The whiskey is 3 year old Turf Mor, only a year older, then mixed with some older whiskeys, and it's intriguing. This has all the oily, burning dust, smoky notes of a standard Connemara, but the rubbery youthfulness of Turf Mor is gone, and this is sweet, with orange notes, and a long, peaty, sweet finish. € 250  ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
88,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection “New Cask” 46.2%,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"A set of two 100&#37; rye whiskeys, triple distilled in copper pot stills, with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask, while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.

Dark in color and deep on the palate. Plenty of weight, too. A base of caramel, with warming cinnamon, persistent mint, brandy-soaked apple, tobacco, polished leather, and oak grip on the finish.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
88,Balblair 2001 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Balblair 2001 Vintage is the first distillery bottling to be non-chill filtered, noncolored, and offered at 46%. It is 10 years old and has been matured in ex-bourbon barrels. The nose offers lemonade, vanilla, allspice, and developing milk chocolate and caramel notes. Clean and straightforward on the palate; sweet and spicy, with tangerines, eating apples, toffee, and more milk chocolate. Cocoa powder in the spicy, relatively lengthy finish. £33",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
88,The Balvenie 40 year old (Batch #2),,Single Malt Scotch,,"The darkness of the hue of this, the second official release of a 40 year old from Balvenie, gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. It emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste, treacle, and Black Forest gateau. Amazingly, on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. Incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2,500",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
88,Glenmorangie 15 year old Nectar d’Or,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,62,"Previously offered as a 12 year old, it now has an extra three years of secondary maturation, after a decade in ex-bourbon casks. The ‘finishing’ casks are ex-Sauternes barriques. Lemonade, icing sugar, vanilla, nougat, and maple on the nose. Progressively sweeter. Rich and sweet on the palate, notably fruity, with spicy orange and brittle toffee. Medium length finish, with milk chocolate-coated ginger and lingering toffee. £39",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
88,Glenrothes 1988,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. This is Glenrothes in its most muscular guise, so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity, there is an extra weight. Think of citrus peels, sticky dates, walnuts, and fruit leather. The palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. For me, it’s at its best au naturel.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
88,Mackmyra Moment Rimfrost,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"This is the whisky equivalent of Metallica playing country songs. You can feel the power of the malt, you know it can kick out hard if it wants to. But it's all wrapped up in Kentucky finery, the sweet bourbon candy and vanilla notes offsetting the salt and pepper, and some mint leaf and berry fruits to send it on its way. It's not an entirely comfortable pairing, but by far the best of this bunch. SEK 1195",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
88,Wemyss Malts ‘Honey Spice’ (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1991 (bottled 2011),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Bunnahabhain, along with Bowmore, is Islay’s greatest user of ex-sherry casks; a throwback to the days when it was part of Highland Distillers. Its rich, thick, and ginger-accented spirit matches the attention of European oak extremely well. In this red tea-colored example, you have resin, saddle soap, ginseng, and treacle toffee on the nose, and a fusillade of roasted spices on the palate before the finish reveals sweet gingerbread. A big huggable bear. £60",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
88,The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Kh1 (distilled at Kilchoman),,Single Malt Scotch,,"You’d hardy expect Kilchoman to be able to spare casks for independent bottlings, but somehow TWE’s Sukhinder Singh has persuaded Anthony Wills to part with one of his precious babies. It exhibits classic Kilchoman notes of clove and fresh scallop, backed with subtle peat, chamomile, and lint. With water, a typically young, peaty aroma of rubber develops (so drink it neat). It shows the huge potential of this distillery. £50 (500 ml)",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
88,Ballantine's Christmas Reserve 2011,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Master blender Sandy Hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture Christmas in the glass, and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich, full, and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle, red berries, orange fruit, and mince pie filling in the mix. It's put together with grace and style, mixes well, and is that rare beast — a blend that can be enjoyed on its own.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
88,Mischief Whiskey,45.0,Craft Whiskey,,"This is 8 year old 100% rye Canadian whisky that Fremont Mischief distillery imports and bottles. Congratulations are due: the rye spice-vanilla aromas are strongly similar to their younger, own-make whiskey reviewed below. The extra age shows: this is Canadian-mellow, not a fiery American rye, even at 45%. All the spice is there, and the floral/grassy complexity, but there are more rich oak notes, and a high, arching finish that sustains the whiskey on the palate.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
88,Hakushu 10 year old,,Japanese,,"Suntory’s second distillery was once the largest producer of malt whisky in the world. Located high in the Japanese Alps, its buildings are hidden within a thickly forested national park, and there is something of that environment in this expression, which is filled with the scents of fern, wet bamboo, pine, and mint. Japanese single malt at its most beguiling.£40",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
88,New Zealand's 2011 Vindication,,New Zealand,,"A single cask, cask strength 16 year old malt from the demolished Willowbank distillery to celebrate the New Zealand All Blacks World Cup victory, and further evidence that New Zealand is back on track. This is whisky hitting its stride. Creamy and honeyed with a cracked lemon pepper undercoat, it's fresh, and very drinkable, with a delightful sugar and spice combo running through it. Oak only really makes an appearance in the finale. NZ$229",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
88,Wiser’s Very Old/18 Year Old,40.0,Canadian,65,"A nose of hot cereal with a dusting of dry cocoa and oaky vanilla, and hints of figs and sesame oil. The palate yields clean grains — a real crack of rye among them — and oak, dried apricot, unsweetened licorice, and a long finish of warming rich cereal. Strikingly clean and non-cloying for Canadian, sweet but not overdone. Good for mixing, but equally good for sipping; a nice end-of-day dram. (Sold as both Very Old and 18 Year Old.)",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
88,The Famous Grouse Celebration,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Available only at the distillery or online, and limited to 5,000 special decanters, this is a special Famous Grouse release to mark the 30th anniversary of the blend. Be careful, though:  it's not a 30 year old blend. But it is excellent and there's lots of very old, woody, and ripe malt in the mix. As Highland Park and The Macallan are in the stable, expect a fruity, oaky, superbly balanced treat.  £80",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
88,Four Roses Limited Edition (2011 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A marriage of four different bourbon recipes aged between 11 and 13 years. Very elegant and stylish, as with many of the Four Roses offerings. Its age also shows, with a firm measure of wood spice and grip on the nose and the latter half of the palate. Soft honey, bright fruit (sultana, ripe peach, tangerine), and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, crisp rye), evolving into darker fruit and more caramelized sugars on the palate, along with leather notes on the finish.",John Hansell,Winter 2011
88,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 12 year old 1999,49.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Rather bold (especially with the spice notes), with dark fruit (black raspberry jam, plum), citrus glaze, vibrant spice (vanilla, cinnamon, clove), a dusting of cocoa powder, polished leather, and pencil shavings, all on a bed of caramel. Long, spicy finish.  A nice way to finish a rich, hearty meal, perhaps? ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
88,Balblair 1989,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, this expression of Balblair offers a distinctive aroma of bananas, along with cooking apples, sultanas, nuts, and spices. It is full-bodied and exhibits a palate of toffee and spicy fruits, and becomes increasingly chocolate-y, with distinct cocoa notes, when given time to breathe. Raisin notes also develop. The finish is lengthy and smooth, with lasting lively spice and vanilla.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
88,Scotch Malt Whisky Society (50:42) 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled in Scotland’s most southerly distillery of Bladnoch in October 1992, this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead, and 150 bottles have been allocated to the U.S. It presents a fresh nose, with initial herbal notes, turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with oat biscuits and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively short, with spicy custard, then a final fruit flourish. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
88,Adelphi (distilled at Glenrothes) 1990 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The nose is redolent with the smells of autumn jam — slowly stewing dark berry fruits — but there’s a hint of hazelnut adding a drier edge alongside some waxed paper. As it opens, out comes argan oil. This constantly changing array of aromas is very Glenrothes, as is the vanilla lift when water is added, which comes with added cordite. The palate is very sweet, filled with fruit syrups and even some dried rose petal. The finish, long. £79",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
88,Chieftain’s Choice (distilled at Rosebank) 20 year old,54.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This refill sherry butt-matured, cask strength variant of the Lowland classic Rosebank was distilled in December 1990. Floral and fruity on the nose. Sweet, with malt and black cherries, plus a hint of new leather. Quite viscous in the mouth; nutmeg, dark chocolate, and toffee on the palate. Walnuts and background dry sherry. The finish offers gentle oak and lots of spice.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
88,Masterson’s Straight Rye Whiskey Batch #3 10 year old,45.0,Rye Whiskey,,"The third recently released 100&#37; rye whiskey sourced from Canada, with the others being WhistlePig (50&#37;, $70) and Jefferson’s (47&#37;, $40). (The one you purchase might depend on which one you can find, as they are all quite limited.) This one sells at a premium to the other two, but shows polish and is nicely rounded. Layers of sweetness (honeyed fruit, caramel, nutty toffee, maple syrup), toasted oak, cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg, and a dusting of cocoa. Very distinctive!",John Hansell,Winter 2011
88,New Zealand,,New Zealand,233,"Rugby union fans will recognize the name and spot that 1987 was the last time the New Zealand All Blacks won the world cup. Bottled for this year&#039;s tournament, it&#039;s 24 year old whisky from the demolished Wilson distillery in Dunedin, and it&#039;s a rarity — very good New Zealand malt. It&#039;s not unlike the Shackleton — big lemon and smoke notes, a pear and apricot heart, lots of oaky spice, and a delicious aniseed rancio conclusion. $NZ 299",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
88,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Single Barrel,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"The second release in the new Taylor line by Buffalo Trace, and the first single barrel offering. Similar in personality to the first release (a small batch offering), but a shade darker in color, flavor, and personality. A bit more intense, too, with more mouthfeel, and not as demure. A fair trade-off. Starts off sweet (rummy, burnt dark fruit, fig cake) then becomes dry, with dried spice, tobacco, toasted oak, and leather. Very exciting and distinctive.",John Hansell,Winter 2011
88,Glengoyne 17 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular Glengoyne lineup, the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. According to the distillers, “The balance has artfully changed. A more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” Citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose, with a hint of plain chocolate. Medium in body, with more plain chocolate notes, plus raisins, orange, vanilla, and malt. Lengthy in the finish, with milky coffee, sherry, leather, and citrus spice. ",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
88,Springbank 14 year old Fino Cask (#265),,Single Malt Scotch,,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 



The freshest of the bunch, chock full of Springbank character. Light and lively. Floral, with plenty of fruit (green grapes, kiwi, apple tart) on a bed of honeyed malt. Nuttiness and brine emerge toward the finish, and linger. ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
88,Amrut Two Continents (Second Edition),50.0,Indian Whisky,,"Two Continents refers to the fact that this is matured in India and then Europe. But Amrut has tweaked the winning formula of the first edition, taking the alcoholic strength from 46% to 50% and using bourbon instead of grain casks for European maturation. The changes are immediately noticeable. The nose is honeyed, with key lime pie, and strawberries and cream. The taste is spikier, spicier, and feistier than before, with dark cherry, blood orange, and unripe banana.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
88,Glann ar Mor 1 an Gwech 11,46.0,French Whisky,,"Brittany in Northern France has a Celtic heart, with its own language and culture. Part of that culture is whisky making. It’s a rugged, untamed, and robust part of the country, so you’d expect similar in the whisky. This is anything but. It is has a sweet, fairy dust, fruit sherbet nose; a sweet pear, cinnamon apple Danish palate; and only late on does a sharp hit of pepper appear. This only enhances the experience. €55 (Currently not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
88,"Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection “Rediscovered Barrels,” 1991 vintage",,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Quite bold and crisply spicy. The most palate-piercing of the three. Well defined flavors of cool mint, warming cinnamon, honey-kissed fruit, and caramel. Briskly spicy finish. When I nose this whiskey, it feels like it’s brandishing a sword at me and shouting “en garde!”",John Hansell,Summer 2011
88,Bowmore 10 year old Tempest (Release 2),56.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The first Tempest to be imported to the U.S. Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks. With the bourbon cask, and relatively young age, you can really feel all the Islay love. Bracing, with plenty of sea character, along with honeyed vanilla, citrus, floral notes (especially lavender), rumbling peat smoke, tobacco, and resinous oak on the finish.  A bit steep in price for a 10 year old, but very dynamic.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
88,Mackmyra Swedish whisky 46.1%,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"Mackmyra has at long last reached the United States. It has been a growing force for some years, and is now a stocky adolescent with a personality all its own. What was challenging, salty peat is now in check, and the fruity delights are to the fore, with canned sweet pear, vanilla, cherry blossom, and lacquer on the nose. There’s a flip-flop on the palate, from melon and vanilla to dusty, peppery peat in the finish. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
88,Wemyss Vintage Malt Ginger Compote,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The Wemyss range — overseen by Susan Colville — has been quietly building a deserved reputation for being among the most consistently enjoyable single cask bottlings. This new example hails from the mighty Benrinnes distillery, but shows a milder side to its make — there is indeed ginger aplenty, along with cumin, crystallized fruit, and jellied peach, but behind is a deep earthy and slightly leathery note typical of ‘The Ben.’ It’s these bass notes that dominate on the richly chewy palate. Best neat. £51 ",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
88,Inish Turk Beg Eternal Voyage,44.0,Irish,,"Meaning ‘the island of the small boar’, Inish Turk Beg is an island off the coast of Ireland. Its latest launch is a super premium whiskey, and it’s lovely. It’s 10 year old Cooley malt matured in casks that previously contained Irish poteen, matured on the island and brought down to bottling strength with island rainwater. The result is a rich green and yellow fruit melee punctuated with zippy spices and zingy wood notes. Expensive, but very lovable. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
88,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Old Fashioned Sour Mash,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"This first limited-edition Taylor release attempts to recreate the “sour mash” process used a century ago. Sweet on the nose and palate (fruit gumdrops, sweet corn, vanilla wafer). Spicy too (cinnamon, evergreen), and clinging on the palate. The sweetness is rescued late, with a firm, dry oak finish. Reminds me of an exhilarating rollercoaster ride that puts the brakes on at the end. Not the most balanced, but certainly distinctive.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
88,Connemara Turf Mor,58.0,Irish,,"Connemara is the peated Irish whiskey from the Cooley distillery, and this one is their (and Ireland’s) smokiest offering yet. This is the first time I ever detected dung (albeit subtly) in a whiskey — and only on the nose, thankfully. It’s curiously intriguing. The style of peat used, along with the youth of this whiskey, has a distinct impact of the whiskey’s flavor. It’s sweet and smoky, which works well. Throw in some bacon fat, diesel oil smoke (like at a boat dock), anise, ginger, honeyed malt, barley, lime, and pear. Underneath all that peat lies what seems like a fairly young whiskey, because it is very brisk and vibrant, but not excessively so. Bonus points for distinctiveness.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
88,Caol Ila 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Unusual, insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try Caol Ila’s other expression: the unpeated version, which — and here’s a bit of history for you — helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s. Rather than this just being Caol Ila with the peat stripped out, the team made  it in a different fashion — but there are still hints of commonality. 

For example, the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here, and it’s not any old grass, but wet grass — like skidding on a football (soccer) field. The mind keeps looking for smoke, but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask), it’s whistle-clean and fruity, and with a touch of water, fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn, custard, and pears. 

The palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. This potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and, again, a jag of acidity. Bizarrely, on the finish, I pick up slight saltiness. A fun dram. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
88,Tomatin,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Aged in a refill sherry puncheon, and the sherry is evident in appearance and on the palate. Soft and sweet, with caramel-coated mixed nuts, toffee apple, rhum agricole, currant (red and black), plum, cinnamon, and surprising brisk mint (especially toward the finish). A pleasing, non-aggressive expression of a mature, sherried whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£340",John Hansell,Spring 2011
89,Cutty Sark Prohibition,50.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Bold spicy nose with dark toffee and dried chili flakes. Explosive pepper notes duel with chocolate as they work through the toffee flavors and begin to show a bitter dark chocolate edge. It’s a gutsy, spirited blend with tongue-searing spices, eventually serving up more sweet notes, but consider adding water or pouring over ice to release more vanilla, fruits, and milk chocolate flavors to take the adventure further.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
89,Port Askaig 45 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The nose offers apricots, honey, vanilla, nutmeg, orange juice, and a hint of mint. Jaffa orange, black banana, licorice, and chimney soot on the palate. Licorice lingers, with an herbal note and tannic oak in the finish. (51 bottles for the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
89,Ohishi Sakura Cask Rice Whisky (2019 Release),,Japanese,90,"Rich amber in color, with aromas of fermented fruits, toasted oak, apple peelings, old parchment paper, golden pancakes, and bright aromatic chili flakes and paprika. A soft, gentle dram that caresses the taste buds with caramelized brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, dried apple, ground almond, and a tang of citrus peel. On the finish, the flavor of apple peelings returns after a brief glow of spice. (1,475 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
89,Matsui Sakura Cask,48.0,Japanese,90,"A nose of cola gummies, Dr. Pepper, fresh green apple, poached pears in cream, dried strawberry, tree blossom, white pepper, allspice, and mint leaves. This whisky, finished in a cask with Japanese cherrywood heads, begins delicately with sweet fruit syrups, before unwrapping golden caramel with a core of spice. Baked apple notes, strudel, unsweetened citrus, and a tang of bitter fruits, which abate to a mouth-coating finish of orange oil. (3,972 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
89,Scottish Leader,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"This rich, smooth, and enticing blend first launched in 1976. It offers aromas of barley, malt, honey, praline cookies, vanilla seed, and smoke. The palate is bright with honey, citrus zest, Quaker Oat Crisp, graham cracker, and vanilla fudge, with gentle pepper, hot cross bun, and orange notes appearing as it becomes creamier. Orange, barley notes, and smoke dance off into the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
89,Town Branch 7 year old Kentucky Single Malt,,Single Malt American Whiskey,39,"Town Branch was founded by an Irishman, Pearse Lyons, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this 100% malted barley whiskey hails from the Emerald Isle. Citrus, confectionary, and floral notes on the nose, with almond, pistachio, and some forest floor and dried leaves. In the mouth, a lively texture undergirds brown butter, mixed nuts, lemon zest, and a hint of ginger. It finishes nutty and warm, with a touch of cigar wrapper and leathery oak.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
89,Ardbeg Drum,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"This Ardbeg Day 2019 bottling was aged in bourbon barrels before a period of finishing in rum casks. Characteristic Ardbeg citrus and smoke on the nose, but with the addition of green figs, eucalyptus, antiseptic, and brine. Very smooth on the palate, with woodsmoke, mango, and papaya. Big peat and black pepper notes in the finish, underscored by tangy citrus. Ultimately, ashy smoke.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
89,Dalmore Port Wood Reserve,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This was initially matured in American white oak barrels before spending an unspecified finishing period in port pipes. The nose is soft and fragrant, with vanilla, red berries, toffee, and ultimately, damsons. Viscous on the palate, with blackcurrants, plums, port wine, and cinnamon. Lively spices, coffee grounds, Seville orange, and dry oak in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
89,Dalmore 18 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,230,"Matured in American oak and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is fragrant with honey, vanilla, ginger, orange marmalade, and a hint of smoke. Relatively full-bodied, with flavors of tangy orange, marzipan, sherry, bitter chocolate, then oak. The finish is long, with licorice and citrus fruit.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
89,Gouden Carolus Single Malt,46.0,Single Malt Belgian Whisky,65,"Produced at the De Molenberg Distillery from a mash of Gouden Carolus Tripel beer and finished in Anker beer casks following bourbon-barrel maturation. This has aromas of peach, barley, marshmallow, light toffee, hops, and warm apple pie, with dry and fragrant spices. Melon, overripe pear, white chocolate, vanilla pod, cinnamon stick, baked apple, dried orange, oak, and spices on the palate; the unfolding flavors are generous and strong.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
89,Speyburn 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,120,"Aged in American and Spanish oak. Figs, cinnamon, and pineapple up front on the nose; in time, smoky fudge. The palate is rich and creamy, with more fudge, honey, and tangerines. The orange note becomes more bitter, accompanied by lively spices and subtle woodsmoke. Long in the finish, with peppery oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
89,Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Tasters’ Selection Barrel Reunion #1,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Reunions are usually sweet, and this is no exception, with aromas of blackberry jam, dark plums, orange Popsicle, grape candy, almond, and cracked grain. It turns nutty on the palate—roasted peanuts, almond croissant—with raspberry jam and oatmeal cookie. The full and rounded finish continues the nutty, jammy flavors, along with oak and milk chocolate. Finished in red wine barrels that had previously been used to age Jack Daniel’s.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
89,Berry Bros. & Rudd Classic Range Peated Cask Matured,,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"A pale blend with hidden depths of flavor and a sweet nose of honeyed pear, vanilla, Golden Delicious apples, taffy, and custard tarts, all overlaid with ashy smoke and drifting smoke trails from snuffed-out candles. Pear, apple, clove, and cracked black pepper meet butter toffee, vanilla, and nippy spices. It’s imbued with a pretty smoky flavor for a peated cask, and leaves a creamy aftertaste to savor. £32",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
89,Dingle Single Malt (Batch No. 3),,Irish Single Malt,100,"Cut-open pomegranate, dried cranberry, and rose petals hint at the port cask influence on this whiskey. Brisket and roasted spice aromas of cumin, fennel, and coriander. Abundant red fruit flavors of cherry, redcurrant, and pomegranate are swept along on a wave of brown sugar sweetness, accompanied by flavors of gummy bear, root beer, clove, ginger, pepper, and aniseed. Sweet and spicy finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
89,The Senator 6 year old Barrel Proof Straight,,Rye Whiskey,85,"Bottled in Fall 2018. A blast of orange blossom on the nose, along with raspberry tart, cherry, and dried currants, set against leather and drying tobacco. A nutty palate with notes of toffee, orange peel, herbs, and light tobacco, with chocolate brownies and blackberry emerging with water. Tropical rye notes of orange, melon, guava, and grape on the finish, along with chocolate, ginger, herbs, and white pepper. Lots of heat, but also depth, flavor, and balance.",David Fleming,Summer 2019

89,MacNair’s Lum Reek Peated 12 year old,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"Runny caramel, green melon, and vanilla, tagged with a few savory and spice notes, though the smoke shows greater peat characteristics than the 21 year old. The tongue dips into honey, fudge, and caramel, duels with mouth-drawing fruits such as raspberry, redcurrant, and cranberry, then settles back under a gentle blanket of spice.

This has a slick, oily/waxy texture and a sweet, nutty taste; those circus peanuts meet a stampede of pepper and sugared mice, the alcohol strength coming to the fore at the end.

A generous oak backbone provides the foundation for plums, nectarines, black pepper, clove, chamomile tea, and piney cedar that sweeps into a dry oak, cocoa, iced-tea finish.

89,Triple Eight Nor&#039;easter Blended Bourbon,,Craft Whiskey,60,"This blend of bourbons (both sourced and house-made) is partly finished in PX sherry casks, and that influence makes itself known through aromas of candied pecans, honey, raisins, figs, oranges, and white pepper, along with cigar wrapper, rose petal, and some minerality.

The palate is light-bodied, but doesn’t shortchange on flavor, with vanilla cookie, apricots, hazelnuts in milk chocolate, apple blossom, and salted light caramels.

89,Naked Grouse,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,35,"Finishing these malts in first-fill oloroso casks helps produce a tempting nose of tangy marmalade, cherry, chocolate sponge, malt, and apple tart, with a rub of spice.

89,Chivas Regal Mizunara Cask,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,50,"This whisky is slowly making its way around the world, but it was worth the wait, as master blender Colin Scott’s use of mizunara oak makes for an impressively different nose from Chivas Regal 12 year old.

89,Armorik Triagoz,46.0,French Whisky,75,"Distillerie Warenghem’s first peated malt, using barley malted to 50 ppm.

89,Wayne Gretzky No. 99 Ice Cask,,Canadian,50,"Wayne Gretzky’s distillery makes serious whisky. A large, copper Vendome column and a Heriot-Watt graduate distiller make for some pretty fine spirit that will eventually fill Gretzky bottles.

89,Heaven’s Door,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"This Tennessee-distilled bouron tastes of crusty cornbread leads off this sweet-styled bourbon brimming with Bit-O-Honey, Peanut Chews, and banana taffy. While the bold sweetness and stone fruits take the lead, there is enough tobacco-laced tannin and spice to back up and balance the initial sweetness, as char-grilled corn flavors take this across the finish line and make it decidedly more-ish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018

89,Crown Royal Blenders’ Mash,40.0,Canadian,28,"Recently, Crown Royal began bottling some of the 50-odd whiskies in its core blend. Hand Selected Barrel and Northern Harvest Rye each peeked behind the blenders’ curtain. Now Blenders’ Mash (originally called Bourbon Mash) unveils the woody vanilla signature of Canada’s bestseller.

89,Compass Box Asyla,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,60,"This radiant, refreshing whisky offers creamy fudge, light vanilla, fresh apple, peach, and biscuit notes on the nose, demonstrating the generosity of the American oak. In the mouth, it’s luscious, balanced, and mouth-coating, with sweet honey, lemon peel, lime zest, and aromatic spices, fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede, riffing on vanilla, melon, and lemon biscuits.

Toffee flavors, with thick smoke, red fruits, orange, raisin, oak spice, gingerbread, marshmallow, strawberry jam, and dark marmalade.

89,Woodford Reserve Double Double Oaked,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Toasted oak, coffee, cola, molasses, and campfire smoke linger over a French bakery and baking spices that are both interesting and appealing. Then chocolate, hazelnut, and nutmeg dominate in a dessert-style treat that later introduces custard, banana cream pie, and candy corn. Almond butter appears for the long finish.(Bottled in winter 2017; Kentucky only)",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,Woodford Reserve 2017 Master’s Collection Cherry Wood Smoked Barley,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"A bourbon made with cherrywood-smoked barley in the mash. When chocolate and cherries meet, instant joy can only be improved with roasted nuts sprinkled on top. That’s what happens here. It’s all there in the opening round, followed by toasted oak, tangerine, pumpkin latte, caramel-covered popcorn, and more cherries, from jam to pitted dark cherries and maraschino to cherry fried pie. If you love cherries, this is a must-have.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018

This edition is very rich, with dark berry notes on the nose, hazelnuts, caramel, cinnamon, and orange fondant creams.

89,Glenmorangie Spìos,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,99,"The ninth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series was matured fully in American oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey. A reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon, then warm, oily cereal notes and honey develop. Initially fruity on the palate, with ripe banana, then slightly earthy, with nutty spice and cocoa powder. Zesty spices in the finish, drinking chocolate, and youthful oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
89,Tullamore D.E.W. XO Caribbean Rum Cask Finish,43.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,26,"Rum-finishing specialists William Grant &amp; Sons add to Ireland’s league of existing rum-finished whiskeys. The lush tropical fruit complexity is abundant with mango, passion fruit, dried papaya, and green apple on the nose.

89,Canadian Club 20 year old,40.0,Canadian,47,"Every now and then, Canadian Club dips into its massive reserves to release a longer-aged version of its core 1858 edition. After an initial hit of toffee, a well-defined woody framework supports signature Canadian Club pruney notes, clean grain, and peppery rye.

89,Singleton of Glendullan 18 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Of the three Singleton bottlings, Dufftown is aimed at European markets, Glen Ord at Asia, and Glendullan at the U.S. The oldest expression in the Singleton of Glendullan stable, this boasts a nose of brittle toffee, dried fruits, and new leather. Nutty toffee, drinking chocolate, banana split, and coconut on the smooth, soft palate. Peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. Good value for the money!",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
89,Hudson Four Grain Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"A lovely balance of oak, clove, and sweetness come together on the nose, while the flavor shows both big impact and refinement. Oak-driven in style, with plenty of tannins and tobacco leaf, but the sweetness and structure stand up, pouring flavors of pecan, caramelized nuts, and toasted spices, with hints of pine before the persistent finish. A very solid and nicely polished bourbon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Paul John) 6 year old,,Indian Whisky,130,"Where Batch 4 is peaty, Batch 5 is smoky, joining aromas of after-dinner mints, rich orange, fondant creams, salted caramel, and sour fruits. On sipping, mint chocolate finds accord with the nose, before a summit of smoke and pepper, then apple, milk chocolate, creamy coffee, and late black currant notes. The smoke hangs deep at the back of the throat. Good flavor trajectory and complexity, with a drying chocolate finish.(822 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glenrothes) 20 year old,,Single Grain Scotch,140,"A delightful whisky with a nose of honey, nectarine, fresh apple, sandalwood, strands of lime, and sweet florals. Sipping unlocks flavors of apple pastries and orange peel, before a powder keg of spices explodes on the tip of the tongue. The aftermath has melting fudge, baked orange, and finishes with hot chili nuts. This hits the trademark flavors of Glenrothes, but the cask strength helps to champion the spices. (Batch 6; 430 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Paul John Kanya,50.0,Indian Whisky,250,"magine there’s a janitor sweeping up the bisected fruit fallen from that fruit-slicing app: cherries, cooked peach, lingonberry, orange peel, fresh apple, fruit syrup, waxy leaves, and taffy chews. Plump mouthfeel with sweet baked fruits, it’s sticky and concentrated with a fabulous fruitiness at this strength. Sugared apple, baked orange, tart plum, clove, and aniseed. Unpeated and matured for around 7 years. A lot of buck for the bang. (1,500 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Exclusive Malts (Distilled at Benrinnes) 2006 11 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Distilled in 2006 and aged for 11 years in a PX sherry hogshead (#310110). Peach blossom, vanilla, and icing sugar on the nose, which becomes more floral in time. Smooth and very sweet on the substantial palate: canned pineapple in syrup, malt, and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Vibrant pineapple and sweet oak notes last to the very end of the lengthy finish. (234 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
89,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Royal Brackla) 2006 11 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Distilled in 2006, this was filled into a virgin French oak cask (#310865) and bottled at cask strength after 11 years.

89,Blood Oath Pact 4,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"It starts out with several forms of wood—split, toasted, charred, and smoldering—and develops baking spices, baked apple, caramel, popcorn, and earth. A tingle hits throughout the palate, as rounded notes of chocolate, cabernet, roasted marshmallow, and white pepper develop over lingering vanilla. Candied corn and cinnamon butter develop into a medium to long finish. (36,000 bottles)",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,J.P. Wiser’s Triple Barrel Rye,,Canadian,23,"This reformulated blend pushes classic Canadian whisky toward bigger, rye-forward flavors. Slowly, honey donuts and ripe fruit add breadth to a robust, almost oily nose. The caramel-sweet and slightly slippery palate seethes with peppery rye spices. Rugged yet balanced, with subtle complexities, the whisky develops an earthiness and almost grassy cereal notes. Gently warm going down, with cleansing bitter citrus pith on a sweet, longish finish. (Canada only) $30 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
89,Redemption Wheated Bourbon,48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,46,"Chocolate, vanilla cream fried pie, and herbs offer insight into this opening round of a fabulous whiskey. Cornbread, pecan pie, roasted walnuts, and chocolate-flavored coffee hit mid-palate, followed by cinnamon roll, pumpkin spice, and mint. But the finish falls slightly short, only offering a hint of caramel.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,The Whistler 7 year old Natural Cask Strength,59.0,Irish Single Malt,77,"This dials up the aromas so high it could freshen up a stadium. After a riot of bright fruits, paradise slice, nutmeg, cinnamon, dates, and raisin, the palate becomes awash with apple and rose hip, though the strength makes it a wild ride, the tongue is conquered into submission. Diluted, it shines with vanilla sponge cake, plum, malt, and spicy nutmeg. Beautiful whiskey, just needs to be pegged back a bit. €65",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,The Dead Rabbit,44.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,43,"Co-founders of New York’s The Dead Rabbit Bar Sean Muldoon and Jack McGarry add their own 5 year old single malt and grain whiskeys to their supplies of grog. Sweetness, caramel, vanilla, and scents of dried fruits. The flavors captured in a light frame reveal citrus peel, malt, dark cookies, a rumble of spice, and conclude with dried peels dipped in chocolate. Drying, with spice and orange. Decent whiskey for sure, but a rather conservative first release for The Dead Rabbit.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Dewar’s 12 year old The Ancestor,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,33,"A straightforward proposition of honey, vanilla sponge cake, barley notes, hints of apple, fresh banana, melon, and bundles of dry straw. It’s a sweetheart: soft vanilla fudge, heather honey, banana-topped banoffee pie, fudge, vanilla sandwich cookies, barley sugar, and lemon peel, with hardly any spice in the early phase. The finish has a snag of pepper at the end, but this is gorgeously tasty, with smooth vanilla fudge all the way.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,BenRiach 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,174,"BenRiach’s latest release was matured in a combination of four diverse cask types: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and red wine. The nose offers tangerines, milk chocolate, and spicy vanilla. Peaches, Brazil nuts, raisins, dates, and more chocolate on the palate, with red berries in the background.

89,GlenDronach Peated Port Wood,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,97,"This is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. The nose is earthy, with damp herbaceous borders, quite acrid smoke, and spicy cranberries. Fresh, juicy red berries on the palate, with background peat smoke becoming ashy, with rich red wine notes. The red wine persists in the finish, accompanied by prickly black pepper. <em>£70; Not available in the U.S.</em>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,Mackmyra Moment Körsbär,47.0,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,145,"This rufescent whisky evokes aromas of cherry blossom, kirsch, white pepper, and wood spices. Light cherry syrup, caramel, and toffee, with a strident eruption of black pepper and clove that sets the underside of your tongue alight. Körsbär is Swedish for cherry and the fat red berry flavors leave a lovely warm glow inside. Despite its color, the sweet cherry wine finish has been judged to perfection. (SEK1198; Not available in the U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Finger Lakes Distilling McKenzie Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,42,"A beguiling nose, replete with cinnamon crumble, blueberry bubble gum, and cardamom. This whiskey bakes you a blackberry pie with a flaky crust and vanilla whipped cream, rounded out with cinnamon, dill, and oregano. The finish has clove-spiced orange peel, lingering sweet marshmallow, and a surprising minerality. This is at least a year older than some of the other Empire ryes, and it shows. Craft skeptics, seek this out. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
89, Exclusive Malts 2002 (distilled at Miltonduff) 14 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,140,"The initial nose is herbaceous, with green apples, then brittle toffee. Developing Juicy Fruit gum flavors.

(Cask no. 263; 176 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,West Cork Glengarriff Series Bog Oak Charred Cask,43.0,Irish Single Malt,45,"Irish bog oak can lie preserved under the turf for thousands of years. The whiskey’s nose is cool and clean, the smoke refined and rather elegant, with aromas of Brazil nut shells, fine Madagascan chocolate, and dark, unlacquered walking canes. Rich and sweet with chocolate orange, fiery spice, ginger cake, menthol, and root ginger, crumbling into bitter orange peel, bark, molasses, and coffee grounds. Finish of bitter roots and ginger. (4,800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,The English Original,43.0,Single Malt English Whisky,75,"Malt barns, cornflakes, some sparse vanilla, redskin peanuts, citrus peel, and a dash of white pepper on the nose. The overall impression on the olfactory system is gentle and mild. A tasty prospect, with poached pear, vanilla ice cream, honeydew, peppery spices, ground almond, custard tarts, lemon zest, malt, and peanut brittle. A little tangy citrus, deep warmth, and vanilla to finish. Rather moreish. (480 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Barrell New Year 2018 Limited Edition,,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Quince, coconut, raspberry, and chocolate walk into an array of breads—sourdough, cornbread, Lebanese pita, and pumpernickel rye. Soon a sweetness develops over earthiness. Think hazelnut latte paired with rich lentil soup, followed by jalapeño cornbread and honey. Its strength never shows, but that promise in the taste is not followed in the finish, which is shorter than expected. If the finish held up, it would be a much stronger whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
89,Bruichladdich Octomore 08.1,,Single Malt Scotch,165,"Distilled in 2008 from 100 percent Scottish barley peated to 167 ppm. It spent 8 years in first-fill American oak casks. Peaches dipped in hot plain chocolate and tarry peat on the fragrant nose. The palate offers sweet, creamy orchard fruits and honey, backed by citrus-laden peat. Drying in the finish to quite a bitter, tannic smokiness. (42,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,Ohishi Kaito’s Cask,,Japanese,90,"Spicy rice crackers, plum sauce, bramble jelly, fragrant oriental spices, and the polished leather of new shoes from this single cask, sherry-matured rice whisky. The syrupy texture bursts with juicy red fruits, plum, red currant, pomegranate, and cooked peach, all bolstered by peppercorns and ground ginger. An enchanting harmony is struck between the fruits and the spice, though the finish is short, with sherry notes and spicy remnants. (660 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Single Cask Nation (distilled at Tormore) 21 year old,49.0,Single Malt Scotch,165,"This was distilled in February 1996, matured in a second-fill bourbon barrel, and bottled in April 2017. The nose yields nectarines, vanilla ice cream, fudge, and milk chocolate. Smooth and rounded on the palate, with ripe apples, toffee, walnuts, and ultimately, a hint of lemon, plus black pepper. Nutty and subtly spicy in the lengthy finish. (156 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,The Sexton,40.0,Irish Single Malt,28,"One of the most striking-looking new releases around, this bone-jangling, sepulchral, triple-distilled whiskey was once entombed in oloroso sherry butts. A nose of baked apple and sultana, rolled marzipan, sesame seeds, and roasted spices. Smooth tasting, with dark fleshy fruits, mixed peel, chocolate, walnut; the taut spicy middle section dies back to baked oranges. A dignified finish, with chocolate and nutmeg at the death. Ingest in peace.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Kurayoshi 12 year old,46.0,Japanese,100,"This is airily fruity, with a greater emphasis on red fruits: strawberry jam, red apple, and red currant. With greater age, the five-spice and ground ginger are dialed up a couple of notches. A thick, jammy texture with flavors of red apple, malt, peppercorn, and chili flakes, glimpses of chocolate and cocoa, though the spices slacken with dilution. Finish of ground coffee, cooking chocolate, and fading spice. (2,160 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89, Eagle Rare 17 year old (2017 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"At first it’s a confectionery delight, with notes of cotton candy, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and praline. Then a spice explosion hits as the caramel becomes more defined. We’re talking pumpkin pie spice with hints of allspice, cardamom, and clove. Tobacco and stone fruit develop toward the end. Alas, its medium finish, with a hint of oak, doesn’t continue the complexity found on the palate.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
89,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2017,48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"A beautiful opening of oak, butterscotch, and fruit quickly becomes more pronounced in banana and pineapple. Then baked apple, Bananas Foster, caramel pudding, and salt water taffy. Hints of smoke and paprika lurk, but marzipan and orange blossom honey nail the landing. The finish doesn’t hold up to the palate, only offering a hint of caramel. Very good, but not quite outstanding.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
89,Glen Elgin 18 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),,Single Malt Scotch,340,"Matured in European oak butts, this 1998 single malt has a nose of soft toffee, vanilla, and orchard fruits.

89, Port Askaig 110° Proof,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"A U.S.-exclusive variant of this popular Islay single malt. Lemon juice and warm granite on the nose, backed by sweet heather, ginger, and developing Jaffa orange, medicinal peat, and charcuterie.

89, Teaninich 17 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),,Single Malt Scotch,310,"Distilled in 1999, this single malt was aged in refill American oak hogsheads and refill American oak barrels. Pineapple and walnuts figure on the early nose, which becomes more floral, ultimately offering violets. The palate is full and fruity, majoring in peaches in syrup, with new-mown hay and white pepper. Nicely balanced and rounded, with buttery notes emerging. The finish dries slowly, with subtle licorice.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
89,Teeling Revival Volume IV 15 year old,46.0,Irish,141,"Part of a series of innovative wine finishes marking the revival of distilling in Dublin. The fourth release spent a year finishing in sweet, aromatic Muscat casks, imparting the bouquet of a rose garden, with ripe peach, satsuma peel, peppercorn, and black cardamom. Syrupy sweet wine notes, canned peach slices, vanilla cream, ginger root, and pepper make this attractive and unique among Irish whiskeys. (12,500 bottles) €120",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
89,Scallywag 13 year old,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,"Scallywag is no lapdog; this mutt runs off the leash and disappears down a rabbit hole. The first thing that strikes is a spicy blast of cardamom, fennel, and onion seeds. Baked chestnut, grapefruit, baked orange, plum, and walnut aromas. Warm marmalade with thick peel, a fanfare of spices, and brown sugar cubes. Gratifying finish of grapefruit peel and a burning core of spice deep in the throat.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
89,Highland Queen Majesty 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,57,"Rich on the nose, with stewed fruit, butterscotch, and soft spices.

Likely sourced from Tullibardine Distillery.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
89,Inchmoan Vintage 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,350,"A peated malt from Loch Lomond, this vintage expression spent 25 years in refill bourbon barrels. A delicate, mildly smoky nose, with vanilla, gentle spice, black pepper, and a subtle medicinal characteristic. Soft and fruity on the palate, with encroaching earthiness and dry peat smoke. The smoke lingers in the lengthy finish, with vanilla, aniseed, and spicy, slightly tannic oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
89,J. Mossman Pink Gold Crown 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,68,"On safe territory here, with neroli oil, caramel, roasted spices, surly peat smoke, and just enough fruity sweetness to stay in the good books. Weightier than the 15 year old, with more aged whisky characteristics: bright clementine, dried citrus wheels, and clove, but after an eruption of smoke, it fades to pineapple, fermenting fruits, and a prickly grapefruit acidity. The ashy embers on the finish retreat quickly.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
89,Fukano 12 year old Single Cask No. 275,,Japanese,100,"Brown rice, balsamic vinegar, hoisin sauce, spiced rhubarb, white pepper, and clove make this an intriguing and appetizing olfactory experience. The palate is fruitier, with dark citrus, stewed apple, star fruit, taffy candy, and orange Jell-O, drifting to light pepperiness and aniseed. A drying aftertaste homes in on orange peel, with some late spice contributions. Complex flavor combinations make this a great exploratory whisky for seasoned enthusiasts. (440 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
89,1792 225th Anniversary,,Bourbon/Tennessee,36,"When spice meets fruit in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Here, chili pepper melds with banana and pear, then baking spices tumble into passion fruit. Next, it’s cornbread, vanilla ice cream, hazelnut, and brown sugar. Finally, a touch of caramel appears toward the end, where a medium but lovely finish takes it home. This will make a fine table whiskey for easy sipping.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
89,Arran Malt Amarone Wine Finish,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This 2017 edition is non-chill filtered and finished in Amarone dry Italian red wine casks.

This edition comprises first-fill American oak casks seasoned with dry <em>oloroso</em> sherry. Significant sherry cask influence early on the nose, with a savory note, rich fruitcake, cherries, malt, and developing vanilla custard. Supple in the mouth, with honey, berry fruits, and citrus notes. Spicier in time. The finish dries slightly, with cinnamon and a sprinkling of black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017

89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Arran) 19 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,69,"Thanks to the Gulf Stream, palm trees grow on Arran’s west coast. That prevailing sunny climate appears to have influenced this mature example from Lochranza: ripe, yellow summer fruits, lime zest, strong mixed spices, and notes of the sea, like sand brushed from seashells. Very approachable; this just oozes sunshine, bringing us the joys of sweet citrus, spices, marzipan, mango, and papaya. The finish is like slurping melted ice cream.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old (batch 5),,Blended Scotch Whisky,190,"Here’s one in the eye for people who grumble about high prices for age statement whisky. Sherry aromas, good-quality plain chocolate, clove-studded oranges, coffee beans, and fat sultanas. Thick, gloopy texture with lashings of sherry, mouth-drawing tannins, a pleasant buzz of wood spices, peppery chocolate, and coffee dregs. It emerges from a savory middle section to a burnt orange salvation, followed by a hot, oaky finish. £148",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
89,Hochstadter’s Family Reserve 16 year old Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,200,"When bakers knead dough there’s a distinct aroma that drifts upward as the flour and water combine. That doughy goodness is found here, with root vegetable cellar and funky leather notes. Then powerful flavors drive this whiskey home: black licorice, caramel-flavored rice cakes, rye bread, paprika, cumin, and sugar cookies over a richly coating mouthfeel. Its greatest flaw is a shorter than desired medium finish with a hint of toasted pecan.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
89,anCnoc 2002,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,84,"This non-chill filtered vintage release was matured in a mix of American oak and Spanish oak sherry casks, and stored in traditional dunnage warehouses.

89,Classic Cask 23 year old Port Pipe,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,160,"Maraschino cherries, red currant, oak bark, and wet slate on the nose after 6 months of finishing. Light, clean opening with cherry and strawberry; a little fig and raisin bring depth. Hints of clove and aniseed dart about, then more oak swells up, though the red fruity sweetness stays in control.

Sweet apple, pear, vanilla, lemon peel, and marzipan appear. A drink that awakens intense citrus sensations of marmalade, mixed peel, lemon and orange segments, followed by a light snap of pepper, gooseberries, nectarine flesh, and a lemony finish with hints of oak.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
89,Douglas Laing Queen of the Hebrides (distilled at Laphroaig) 18 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,181,"The first expression in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular Consortium of Cards Single Cask Scotch Whisky Collection was sourced from a single refill butt. The nose offers sweet peat, toffee bonbons, brine, beach tide lines, and antiseptic. Finally, a sooty chimney. The palate is zesty, with ashy peat, asphalt, chili, and citrus fruit. Dark chocolate, more soot, and extra chili in the very long finish. Quintessential Laphroaig! (665 bottles) £140",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
89,Gordon & MacPhail Cask Strength 2005 (distilled at Caol Ila),,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Aged in first-fill sherry butts, this cask strength vintage from Gordon &amp; MacPhail features a nose which opens with savory ginger, becoming more fragrant, plus vanilla, fudge, and warm leather. Oily in the mouth, with ripe cherries, sweet spices, pipe tobacco, and new leather. Nutty and slightly earthy. Citrus fruit, dry spicy peat, and black pepper in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
89,Backbone Prime Blended (Batch 4),52.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Think southern kitchen: cornbread, sorghum, and brown sugar. Then it blossoms into a more traditional spice-forward American whiskey, with caramel, vanilla, baking spices, black pepper, habañero, and jalapeño honey. Toward the end, subtle herbs appear just before a long and spicy finish.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
89,Buchanan’s Special Reserve 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,90,"This blend has style. Coils of red apple peel, ripe orange, cherry blossom florals, freshly split oak, and dry, gentle spices, like running a wet finger around an old spice jar. It’s juicy and thick, with festive satsumas, some bright sharpness, and acidic citrus overcome by juicy sweetness, marmalade flavors, and walnut. The refined finish has a tangle of spice, orange peel, honey, and just a whiff of struck match.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
89,Boone County Distilling Eighteen 33 10 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,53,"First it’s oak and leather, then spices of a different sort dominate, such as anise, fennel, and caraway. Then, the usual suspects in a bourbon of this age: caramel, vanilla, leather, oak, nutmeg, and slight hints of off-the-beaten-path notes: black pepper and sage. After a lovely medium-to-long finish with a strong note of toasted pecan, this is, for sure, a good, though not great sipping whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
89,Tipperary Boutique Knockmealdowns 10 year old,47.0,Irish,100,"Cinnamon, dusty cocoa, rich toffee, and sultana on the nose. The mouthfeel is leaner, with more cocoa and savory ham notes, sweet popcorn, cinnamon, and thin slivers of chocolate, all shot through with sweet stewed fruits. Water brings out a soft chocolate brownie before a lengthy finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
89,Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit,,Bourbon/Tennessee,54,"An 8 year old from Wild Turkey’s Warehouse G, it’s classic Turkey on the nose, with a little spice, caramel, nutmeg, oak, and slight hints of lavender. Then sautéed barley, pecan shell, brown sugar, chewing tobacco, and bittersweet chocolate. An earthy oak note blossoms, with a layered caramel chew following this whiskey home to a medium finish. (<em>Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive</em>)",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
89,BenRiach 22 year old Moscatel Wood Finish,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,180,"This limited edition bottling is non-chill filtered and initially matured in bourbon barrels before an unspecified period of finishing in sweet Moscatel fortified wine casks from Spain and Portugal. Sweet grapes, dates, cinnamon, salted butter, wax polish, and printer’s ink on the nose. Viscous on the palate, with ripe plums, honey, plain chocolate, white pepper, and worn leather. The finish is long and fruity, with drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
89,Bruichladdich The Laddie Ten Second Limited Edition,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,66,"Matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, and French wine casks. Clean and fresh on the early nose; crisp green apples, vanilla, and floral notes, with just a hint of maritime influence in the background. Smooth on the palate, with spicy pear, honey, and ripe peaches; soon quite drying. The floral finish lingers, with spicy honey, drying spices, and ultimately a hint of smoke. (18,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
89,Speyburn 25 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,300,"The oldest expression available from Speyburn, this has been aged in a mix of American oak <em>fino</em> sherry and bourbon casks, and is non-chill filtered. Vanilla, honey, lemon, and spice on the fragrant nose. Quite full-bodied and creamy on the palate; nutty, with malt, honey, and citrus fruit. The citrus fruit becomes spicier in the medium-length, oaky finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
89,Barrell American Whiskey (Batch 003),,Miscellaneous,65,"A composite of Tennessee and Kentucky whiskeys, finished in sherry butts and port pipes. It’s sherry-forward, but rich and layered in roasted nuts, caramel, dried caramel, vanilla cake batter, chocolate, chamomile, and roasted apple. Marzipan and honey flash with hints of hazelnut, pear, and molasses cookie over a slightly chewy mouthfeel. The medium to long finish gives a slight hint of citrus.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
89,Dublin Liberties Copper Alley 10 year old,46.0,Irish,60,"Here’s a perfect example of a bourbon-matured whiskey lit up by a sherry finish; you can sense the toffee aromas swathed in dark sherry, yielding flavors of raisin and fig. A beautiful velvety texture with flavors of cherry, dark orange, rich notes of chocolate-dipped dark berries, toffee sweetness, and wood spices. When a bitter note creeps in, swallow and enjoy the short finish of currants and mixed peel.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
89,Ardbeg Twenty One,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,500,"Distilled at a time when the future of the distillery looked bleak. It is non-chill filtered and mildly herbal on the nose, with soft peat, muted iodine, and a sprinkling of pepper, plus warm leather. The palate is initially peppery, then vanilla and green apples emerge, along with aniseed and rich peat. Peppery to the end, with a hint of iodine and coal smoke.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
89,Cragganmore,,Single Malt Scotch,600,"An inviting and complex nose of honey, orchard fruits, apple blossom, rosewater, and subtle cinnamon. Rich and creamy in the mouth, with initially intensely sweet fruit and spice notes, followed by ginger, toffee, and vanilla. The finish is warming, gently spicy, and medium in length.

89,Cambus 40 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,1150,"The oldest of the 2016 Diageo Special Releases, distilled in 1975, then rested in refill American hogsheads. The initial nose is slightly balsamic, with green tea, ripe eating apples, and developing vanilla. Creamy on the palate, with big vanilla custard notes, white pepper, and dates. Relatively short in the finish, with soft spices and mild oak. No negative tannins, despite its age. (1,812 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
89,Rebel Yell Single Barrel 10 year old (barrel 4744359),50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Caramel and earth on the nose, with freshly tilled soil, flowers, and oak just before an explosion of caramel, vanilla, allspice, and fruit. It really grows on you, with a buttery mouthfeel that presents cinnamon, honey, cornbread, marzipan, pecan pie, granola, nutmeg-dusted pumpkin pie, and a slight hint of candied ginger. Finishes long, with rich caramel. Quite tasty.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
89,J.P. Wiser’s Union 52,45.0,Canadian,48,"The nose is focused on cereal, hints of fresh ripe cherries, cooked fruit salad, herbs, and overt, bourbon-like charcoal. Take a sip though, and big, beautiful tones of real peat reek rush to the fore on the palate. These are sustained by sweet barley sugar, candied fruit, dry cereal, and a lush mouthfeel. The smoke, incidentally, comes from a few drops of real scotch added at blending. Very moreish. <i>(British Columbia exclusive) </i>$65 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2016
89,The Half Century Blend,,Blended Scotch Whisky,749,"This is how to age gracefully. A remarkable, decadent drop released to follow the success of the Golden Age blend, this delivers heather honey, tangerine juice, banana chips, dried apricots, and sanded oak. It’s a whisky of big, expansive flavors. Citrus strands, candied peel, neroli, and dried mango swirl amidst a syrupy mouthfeel, steadily becoming creamier as it squeezes out yet more flavor. Dry, oaky finish with residual fruit, coffee beans, and pleasingly bitter oak tannins that tingle the gums. £600",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
89,Buffalo Trace 30 Minute Infrared Light Wave Barrels,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Toffee and maple syrup, cigars aged in cedar, along with polished leather. Resinous grip on the finish balanced by dark, caramelized sugars. Tastes older than its true age. 375ml",John Hansell,Fall 2016
89,Arran 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Following the 2015 limited edition release of 18 year old Arran single malt, an 18 year old has now been added to the core range. It is uncolored and non-chill filtered. The nose is bright with freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, honey, and vanilla fudge, plus a fleeting menthol note. The early palate mirrors the fresh fruit-laden nose, with developing ginger, honey, malt, and milk chocolate. Slowly drying in the finish, with plain chocolate, licorice, and charred oak.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
89,Tomatin Cù Bòcan 1988 Limited Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,262,"Tomatin released this 28 year old expression under its Cù Bòcan label. This cask strength variant was matured in refill hogsheads and refill sherry butts that previously contained heavily-peated Islay single malt. The nose is sweet and fruity, with apples and pears, background vanilla, and sweet, light smoke. The palate is voluptuous and sherry-sweet, with chili peppers and subtle, earthy peat smoke. The finish is slowly drying, with persistent spice, nuts, and smoke. (2,200 bottles) £200",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
89,High West Light Whiskey,46.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),100,"This is a batch of 100 barrels of MGP light whiskey, an American whiskey using higher distillation proofs and used cooperage. It reminds me of 1980s Crown Royal, with floral vibrancy, honey, and a slight hint of chocolate, followed by licorice, allspice, and vanilla. Its spice hits early and often with balanced black licorice. Blackberry, blueberry, and ginger come down the final stretch for a nice medium-length finish. Sourced whiskey. <em>(Distillery only)</em>",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
89,Bulleit Barrel Strength,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"High rye is evident, with rounded baking spices up front, leather, muted caramel, vanilla, and a hint of tobacco. This ABV beast coasts with the warmth and richness of crème brûlée, toffee, cinnamon rock candy, fruit, and nutmeg. Oh wait, there’s more. Smoke kicks in toward the end with marshmallow undertones and more cinnamon, finishing strong with lasting spice. This is a cask strength sipper or a lovely bourbon on the rocks.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
89,Bainbridge Yama American Single Grain Barley Mizunara Japanese Oak Cask,45.0,Craft Whiskey,495,"This high-end whiskey exhibits restrained oak, elegance, and delicateness, with wonderful poached pear, cereal, crème caramel, floral, and lemon chiffon cake aromas that yield to a bright beam of tart, mouthwatering citrus—clementine, lemon, and yuzu—tingling with allspice. Bright, light, and lively, but not lacking in complexity, finishing with marshmallow, toasted almond, and marzipan. Very pretty! American single grain whiskey aged in Japanese Mizunara oak casks.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2016
89,Stalk & Barrel 100% Rye  Cask Strength (Cask 34),,Canadian,100,"As time goes by, Still Waters is developing a recognizable house style. Acetone, fruit esters, and floral notes on the nose, with lemon biscuits and a hint of graham crackers. Hot, sweet, and lively on the palate, with blistering spices soon cooled to sweet dark licorice. Hints of Cheerios and roasted grain are Still Waters’ signatures, as this all-rye whisky shows. Clean dry grass, pears, and sweet barley sugar on a medium finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
89,The Exclusive Malts  (distilled at Invergordon)  42 year old 1973,,Single Malt Scotch,255,"Lush caramel, red apples, sanded oak, and olive oil first pressings with herbal overtones, this ancient grain has managed to retain its distinctive character. The palate is initially mouth-drawing with an oily structure, the flavors are a pleasing tangle of caramelized apple, toffee, and sultana, with a noticeably long finish. Banish any notion you might have of adding water right now. It’s welcoming to have a great aged grain unafraid to show its true colors. (248 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
89,"The Exclusive Malts  (distilled at Cooley, Cask 20024)  13 year old 2002",,Irish,130,"The golden sweetness of the wine cask is apparent, with light floral notes, baked almonds, warm flapjacks, and golden syrup. Initially, it lands light as a feather, introducing melon and green apple, becoming textured with cinnamon spices and nutmeg, and swirling with caramelized sugar sweetness. Complex, with fruit sourness and gooseberry notes adding depth to the flavor progression, leading to a dry and pure finish. Water adds sugariness: it’s preferable in its full-strength fighting Irish guise. <em>(K&amp;L Wines only,</em> 380 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
89,Peat Elements of Islay,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,46,"Roasted spices, more peat than smoke, coastal breezes, lemon creaminess, bacon-flavored chips, and carbolic soap. Disarmingly, it starts with lemon, apple, and honey before, brilliantly, the pepper and chili heat slams into you like an Acme grand piano falling from the sky. Bitter chocolate notes, velvety cocoa, and dry orange peel, with morning-after cigar smoke, settling ash, and roasted meat juices. Seriously impressive delivery of flavor from Oliver Chilton, who has concocted a versatile dram at a terrific value. £35",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
89,Jura Tastival,51.0,Single Malt Scotch,111,"The 2016 Fèis Ìle limited edition of Jura was triple finished in sherry casks, namely palomino <em>fino</em>, amoroso <em>oloroso</em>, and apostoles <em>oloroso</em>, and is non-chill filtered. The nose is soft and warming, with notes of candy, vanilla, and almonds against a sweet sherry background. The palate is rich and rounded with a significant sherry influence—dried fruits, notably raisins and prunes, new leather, and aniseed. Finally, slightly mouth-drying with prickly spices and more raisins. <em>(2016 Jura Tastival whisky festival exclusive) £85</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2016
89,Shelter Point 2016 Inaugural Run,46.0,Canadian,54,"Vancouver Island grain farmer Patrick Evans built Shelter Point distillery in Oyster River on one of the last remaining seaside farms in British Columbia. Distiller James Marinus has been crafting traditional single malt whisky there since 2011. Barley sugar and a sweet waxiness lead into ripe red fruits and soft peachy sweetness, with mild spices and hints of mealy halva. Malty and mature well beyond its years, rising peppery notes introduce a long, sweet, grassy finish. Nicely balanced. C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
89,BenRiach Cask Strength (Batch 1),,Single Malt Scotch,86,"Remember those remarkable 20+ year old BenRiachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? Think again. This new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose, followed by mango, orange blossom honey, and Portuguese custard tarts. It needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue. A sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end. Marked within its competitive set. £60",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
89,Glenmorangie Milsean,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,99,"Milsean is the latest Private Edition release from Glenmorangie. After initial bourbon barrel maturation, the whisky spent several years in heavily-toasted Portuguese red wine casks. Fresh fruits on the early nose, with ginger and a hint of musk. Coconut and icing sugar emerge. Smooth and rounded on the palate with a big fruit hit that becomes more citric in time, plus lively oak spices. Lingering in the finish, with persistent spice. Finally, plain chocolate and chili.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
89,WhistlePig 15 year old Vermont Estate Oak Straight Rye Whisky,46.0,Canadian,200,"WhistlePig does nothing by half measures. They had massive oak trees culled from their Vermont property, coopered into heavily-charred barrels, then used them to finish batches of already mature 100% rye. Layer on layer of soft vanilla, old lumber, cinnamon, fresh orange peels, baking spice, dark fruits, and medicinal hints of resin. Peppery hot and oakily sweet. A slight dustiness and a big juicy butterscotch kiss<em>.</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
89,Ballantine’s 30 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,380,"The nose unravels with milk chocolate, thick hazelnut spread, and a slender twist of orange peel, though that delectable goodness is evenly balanced with peppermint patties and detectable light, floral top notes. This has a lush softness, with a perceptibly slow crescendo of flavors incorporating caramel toffee, popcorn, and chocolate praline. It’s beautifully integrated with a smooth, dense texture, and releases its grip reluctantly with just a whisper of a peppermint reprise.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
89,Ballantine’s 17 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,69,"Malt biscuits, runny caramel, blended black tea, melting butter sliding across a hot skillet, the leather uppers on new Oxfords, and a more enjoyable waft of peat smoke than expected. Clean, light flavors; lime jelly, root ginger, initially not overly sweet, then a boost of honey, caramelized fruits, with toffee and cocoa later still. It’s pricked with hints of smoke throughout, with a long finish of pepper and other spices. Perfectly enjoyable anytime.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
89,Shays’ Rebellion American Whiskey,43.0,Craft Whiskey,120,"Triple-distilled whiskey from Samuel Adams Cinder Bock beer, aged 3.5 years in Samuel Adams Utopias casks. Definite character of strong beer to the nose, very light smoke, some mixed fruit notes. Mellow smoke on the tongue, broad malt and fruit (prune plum, dried cherry, baked apple), a luxurious feel. Finish is slow and even. Flavorful, but not heavy or shouting. The casks have had a great effect here, but the distilling is skillfully done.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
89,Yamazaki Sherry Cask (2016 Edition),48.0,Japanese,300,"I tried this alongside the ‘legendary’ 2013 which, while good, remains too tannic for me. This though, has refinement and some complexity, with roasted tea, scented wood, resin, new brogues, and then the fruity Yamazaki undertow. In time you’ll get perfumed, incense-like sherried elements. It’s the finish where things take off into rose petal, strawberry, and Yamazaki’s pineapple signature. Water increases the tannin. Better than 2013, but still only for sherry bomb and tannin lovers.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
89,Craigellachie 31 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,718,"The Craigellachies just keep on coming. This, the oldest of the new Original Bottling range, is the most fiercely priced. It shows balanced and slightly restrained mature notes—think of candle wax and waxed leather. Some fruit syrups, clementine, and honey then follow. The palate is thick—the distillery’s worm tubs having an effect—giving floral accents and a hint of barbecued pineapple. Not the heaviest of the range, but delicious. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>) £500",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
89,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1988,,Single Grain Whisky,128,"This example is more assertive than the Strathclyde 1987 (<em>see below</em>), but with a better defined grain character. Peeled plum skins, Christmas spices, and honey. Well-balanced yet intense, it feels packed with potential. Warming, with dried orange peel, a big wave of ginger, spice, dried apple, and mango ensure sufficient sweetness to swamp the acidic tendencies of the citrus. The spices rattle around the mouth for some considerable time, colliding with the dry citrus. (198 bottles) £89",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
89,The Golden Age Blend,,Blended Scotch Whisky,503,"Take a parcel of Macallan, Glenrothes, and Tamdhu all aged over 40 years, season lightly with gently peated Bunnahabhain and North British grain whisky and what do you get? Golden sultanas, linseed oil, orange blossom honey, butterscotch, drying nuttiness, and cedarwood. Blending has beneficially enhanced the three sherry-casked malts. It’s juicy and sticky, rhubarb and damson jams, oak tannins, and a little burnt note as the power swells. Cocoa, chocolate, and lingering oak to finish. (210 bottles) £350",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
89,Tom’s Foolery Bonded,50.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"One of the first non-Kentucky bonded bourbons since the 1950s. There’s trepidation in this glass. Floral, pear, peach, and chocolate tickle the nose, leading to relief that its aroma isn’t over-oaked like some smaller distillers’ bourbons. Apricot meets dark chocolate, mint, and smoked corn, with hints of caramel, walnut shell, and a long, chicory-coffee finish. The taste is definitely not Kentucky but is convincingly delicious, especially the bitter notes toward the end. Taste this lineage; something special is starting.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
89,Woodford Reserve Distiller&#039;s Select,,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"The same mashbill as its sister brand Old Forester, Woodford Reserve is an unknown combination from Brown-Forman’s Louisville and Versailles distilleries. There’s no age statement, but Woodford is around 7 years old. The key here is balance. One note never overtakes the other; nutmeg, mango, baked apples, cinnamon, blueberry pie, and vanilla seem to walk in perfect harmony. Then we find the gingerbread, caramel, and vanilla jumping into layers of smoke and spice.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
89,Balblair 1990 (2nd release),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,150,"The oldest of Bablair’s current core bottlings was distilled in 1990, and after maturing for 21 years in bourbon casks it was transferred to <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts for a further 2 years prior to bottling. Citrus fruits, furniture polish, cloves, cinnamon, and parma violets on the nose. A silky mouthfeel, spicy, with dark berries, dates, and rich sherry. Slowly drying, with aniseed and dark chocolate in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
89,Glenrothes Vintage Reserve,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Glenrothes is always this fascinating mix of the malty and the fruity and is one of those drams which needs time in the glass to open. Given that time, you will be rewarded with date, raisin, some fudge, and some real savory depth before a sprinkling of trail mix and a sweetening into nougat and caramel, spice and chocolate. A replacement for the old Select Reserve, this is a magnificent Glenrothes and at a great price, so don’t dare moan.",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
89,Maker’s Mark,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"The original Maker’s Mark, tried and true, and the same since the 1950s. The nose is consistent with a flare on the floral, toffee and caramel, roasted almonds, and loads of vanilla. Just when you think you’ve tasted this a million times, it offers candied fruit and pie crust with the final touches of praline and a hint of pecan shell.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Paul John (Batch 1),,Indian Whisky,129,"Thick treacle, chocolate glaze, sooty fireplaces, spearmint, coal dust, roasted hazelnut, charcoal logs, and earthen warehouse floors make quite an impression. It’s shot through with mouth-puckering tart juiciness, plum, fig, and smoke, and though it becomes fatter and richer, the ashy core continues to blow until it finishes, leaving behind char and cocoa. Water provokes some juicy apple notes and sweetens the finish, but despite the ABV, you should experience this at cask strength. Ride the bull! (148 bottles) £89",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
89,Last Drop Distillers (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1967,,Single Malt Scotch,7000,"This is the first single malt to be released by the Last Drop Distillers, and the Aberdeen-shire veteran is old-style, well-peated Glen Garioch. Unusually, it was matured in what the bottlers describe as “a bourbon-style remade hogshead cask.” Just 118 bottles are available globally. Fruity and herbal on the nose, with apples, marzipan, ginger, linseed, and a hint of camphor. Complex and distinctive. Surprisingly vibrant fruit notes fill the perfumed palate, with allspice, before it starts to become tannic. Ultimately very mouth-drying, with subtle smoke, and a fatty spice note at the very end.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2016
89,Jack Ryan The Centenary Single Barrel 15 year old,,Irish,110,"Warmed honey oozing over toasted English muffins, with dry spices and a twist of clementine peel. There’s a cool, clean freshness too. A satiny texture with an immediate wave of flavor engulfs the tongue; a big hit of citrus peel, not fruit, is joined by vanilla softness and a hint of nuttiness. This citrus turns delectably tangy and hangs in there, no matter how diluted it becomes. The tanginess persists into the long, lush, warming finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
89,Johnnie Walker Select Cask Rye Cask Finish,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,45,"A zeitgeist Johnnie Walker fine-tuned for the American palate, this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon, cocoa, and the toasted coconut of macaroons, mingled with strands of smoke, dried walnut, nutmeg, and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla. Lots of American oak at play here. It’s elegant, dry, and smooth with vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, and flashes of spice. It’s fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish. Value Pick.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
89,Buffalo Trace Old Fashioned Sour Mash (105 Entry Proof),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Light in body, with creamy notes of vanilla and honey married with orchard fruit. All this is balanced by warming dried spice on the finish. Very enjoyable. Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Barrel Aged Bourbon 2015 Release. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
89,Eagle Rare 17 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Usually the sleeper of the Collection. Toffee mixed with cinnamon, mocha, <em>añejo</em> rum, golden raisin, dried citrus, and tobacco, with firm leather and oak on the finish. Last year’s release was more balanced and a great expression of the brand, but I’m afraid this release is a little heavy on the oak; particularly on the finish. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
89,Caol Ila Unpeated 1997 17 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015),,Single Malt Scotch,140,"Aged in first-fill American oak, this shows a real brightness, crisp fruit, and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass, before moving into pear and tarragon. The palate is intense, with a hay note, then an almost <em>fino</em> sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. Reduced, there’s more of a soft flow, though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. A steal at this price. Snap it up.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
89,Glenfarclas £511. 19s. 0d.,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Unusually named—it refers to the price paid for the distillery—here is Glenfarclas in slightly lighter guise than usual. Fresh and clean at the start, with hints of sweet nut and soft cooked fruits; subtly sherried elements then begin to come through. The palate is balanced, with supple tannins and a dark depth to the mid-palate. Those sweet fruits in the nose continue all the way through. Refined and rather lovely. £85",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
89,Port Ellen 1983 32 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015),,Single Malt Scotch,3700,"Matured in refill European oak sherry butts, this year’s Special Release has more weight than many previous expressions and a fascinating smokiness that comes across like a just-lit fire: fire lighter, burning paper, fire grate, and wood smoke. The more active oak adds walnut skin notes and rich dried fruits before the smoke returns. All very sophisticated with enough sweetness to balance. Excellent, but, ouch, that price!",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
89,Wemyss Malts Kiln Embers,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,64,"This is so much more than a pumped-up version of Peat Chimney; this has sweet smoke from singed green wood twigs, light honey, peach, all balanced with TCP-soaked bandages. Nothing harsh or off-putting, it’s just a delight. Sweet honey, orange, generous malt, and caramel, but it’s the smoke coiling its way throughout that makes the greatest impression on the palate and finish. These blended malts tend to move quickly, so grab one while you can. Perfect for winter drinking. (12,000 bottles) £42",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (batch 1),,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,74,"These Boutique-y blends are delivering terrifically good whiskies time after time, but the small batches sell through quickly now that the word is out. This one has plums, apple, mixed peel, spices, walnut, and sherry notes. The palate is fizzy, with plummy depths, chocolate shavings, ginger biscuits, and dark fruits with a medium-weight mouthfeel. This can go toe-to-toe with the best of ‘em. Once the ginger settles down it leaves a pleasing, mild maltiness. Add water if you must. (370 bottles) £49",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
89,Green Spot Château Léoville Barton,46.0,Irish Single Pot Still,65,"Mitchell &amp; Son’s classic whiskey finished for 1 to 2 years in wine casks formerly used by the Barton family in the St-Julien appellation. Spiced apple, redcurrant, blushing pink young raspberries, with a deeper earthiness, like a hedgerow run wild. An autumnal character: apple, rhubarb, ginger, piquant fruits, more vanilla, then a finish of sweetened apple and peppercorns. A definite imprint from the higher-strength pot still. It feels like the wine has shaped, sculpted, and finessed the whisky beautifully. <em>À votre santé!</em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
89,Glen Breton 21 year old (cask 665),43.0,Canadian,300,"Celebrating its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, Glenora distillery has certainly hit its stride. This clean, grassy 21 year old tastes like nothing so much as a top Speyside scotch. Fresh hay notes and a slightly effervescent spiciness give the feel, but not the taste, of hot black licorice. Barrel notes begin to show in the middle, resolving into a long, peppery, pithy finish. Barrel selected by Mike Brisebois for Casker’s whisky club. Good stuff, Glenora! <em>(Distillery only) </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
89,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 30 year old 1984 (cask #8005),,Single Grain Whisky,220,"A rare old single grain whisky from Scotland’s most northern grain distillery. The nose brings together varnished oak, clove, dried orange peel, and molasses. On the palate, an unexpectedly lush mouthfeel supports a flavorful combination of citrus, molasses, and varnished oak. This single grain has depth and character that’s completely uncommon to the category, tasting a lot more like an aged rum. A long, acidic, slightly sour, dry, and spicy finish rounds out a unique and intriguing whisky. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
89,Compass Box The Peat Monster Cask Strength Magnum,,Blended Scotch Whisky,188,"Dry peats tossed on a driftwood fire with coastal aromas of sun-scorched seaweed beside high tide rock pools comprise this refined dram. A momentary glimpse of lighter lemon, lime, and pineapple is quickly snuffed out by the full strength assault. It’s like pulling the pin on a grenade. There’s a dense barrage of peat moss, worn leather, and cocoa at the death. Ride through it to glory. Possibly the highest ABV that Compass Box has ever given us. £120",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
89,Wemyss Malts The Rockpool 1995 vintage (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,180,"A very solid and sound Bowmore with saline notes, some dried hot pepper, and masses of menthol, which give a buzzy, nose-cleaning effect. The smoke gently glides along throughout. The palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit, with a tingle of salt. The smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate, giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. Becomes nicely funky in time. Recommended.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
89,Glenturret The Brock Malloy Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,313,"Cask # 328 was filled at Glenturret on December 16, 1986 by stillmen Hugh Malloy and Chic Brock. After 28 years of maturation, it has yielded 240 bottles. It is exclusively available online at thefamousgrouse.com. Boiled fruit sweets, heather, hazelnuts, old oak, and musty bung-cloths on the nose, plus slight mint. The palate is rich and fruity, with honey, rum, vanilla fudge, and ginger root. Spicy milk chocolate and coconut in the lengthy finish, with non-intrusive oak. Classic Glenturret. £200",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
89,Ledaig 42 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,5450,"This veteran Ledaig release from Tobermory distillery is the oldest to date, having been made in 1972. 500 bottles are available globally. Musty old leather, malt, and plum pudding on the slightly earthy, phenolic nose. In time the leather becomes suppler, with ripe figs and, finally, soot. Voluptuous in the mouth, with sweet sherry, plain chocolate, and soft spices, plus black pepper, an emerging note of coal. The finish is very long, with citrus fruit, chili, smoke, and subtle oakiness.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
89,Springbank Marrying Strength 10 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,66,"A number of ‘Marrying Strength’ variants of 10 year old Springbank have been released, retailing exclusively through the Cadenhead Whisky Shop in Campbeltown. The 2014 expression is bottled at 49.9%. Brine, new leather, and pipe tobacco on the nose, with developing caramel. Maritime characteristics are accentuated with time. Voluptuous on the palate, balanced, with sweet leather, peaty spices, and apricots. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with black pepper and rock salt. Quintessential Springbank, and the best 10 year old sampled to date. £42",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
89,Springbank Sherry Wood 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Released in February 2015, this cask strength expression of 17 year old Springbank has been entirely matured in sherry casks. 9,120 bottles are available globally. The nose offers sea spray, blood orange, ginger, and discreet sherry. Finally, some peat. The sherry really makes its presence felt on the palate, which is full and slightly oily, with rich fruitcake flavors, soft toffee, coffee, and ripe cherries. The finish is lengthy, slightly peaty, with more sherry, treacle toffee, and trademark Springbank ozone.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2015
89,John J. Bowman Single Barrel,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Triple-distilled bourbon from Virginia. Actively aromatic, blowing right out of the glass: tart berries, hot corn, oak, and stick cinnamon. Hot, but surprisingly soft and light for 50% (triple distillation?), with sweet corn and more of the berries, wrapped in oak and a touch of char. Everything persists to the finish, including the heat, leading to a twist of oak at the end. Manages to be big but light at the same time.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
89,Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel,52.0,Rye Whiskey,60,"Sweet, spicy nose, with sharp mint jellies and brittle sugar laid over the oak presence. Shifts in the mouth to no-nonsense rye: bitter, savory, dried grass, with the sweetness as a spark glinting through it all, while a mineral character plays as backbone. The finish is prickly and warming, with fleeting richness. A very lean rye overall, a bit challenging, a bit old school.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
89,Miyagikyo 12 year old,45.0,Japanese,110,"The first impression is of dried apricot compote, pomegranate, sweet persimmon, a little touch of anise, then herbs and strawberry. Quite creamy, with fine structure and, with water, cappuccino and quince jelly. There&#039;s a hint of char on the palate to start, then the sweetness returns, making the mid-palate distinctly peachy, with added poached orchard fruits. Broad and quite elegant, with a smooth delivery. Water lightens things, allowing more floral elements to develop. Versatile.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
89,Pikesville Straight Rye,55.0,Rye Whiskey,50,"Heaven Hill’s 80-proof standard Pikesville is a summer favorite, so I was eager to try this. A woody depth to it at 6 years old: 110 proof-hot, stewed plum and horehound candy, and sizzling rye spice behind it. It&#039;s a jawbreaker: full and hot in the mouth, with sweet grassy spice, bitter rye grain as it progresses, and crackling sugar near the end, just before it all smooths into a savory layered finish. Exciting ride, great ending.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
89,Connemara 22 year old,46.0,Irish,189,"The oldest official Connemara expression from Beam Suntory delivers the peat sublimely, judiciously balanced with estery notes of half-time oranges and pineapple rings, and an inescapable note of nail polish remover. It’s bright, beautiful whiskey, rich with piquant orange and dark vanilla, smooth and packed with flavor, which softens to fresh cream and spiced toffee. Ebbs away with dignity, trailing creaminess and intense fruit in its wake. €178",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
89,High West Bourye (Batch 1446),46.0,Miscellaneous,80,"Back on the market again, but with a tweaked formula (a blend of 9 year old bourbon with 10 and 16 year old rye whiskeys). This Bourye sports a rye freshness, crispness, and zing. Notes of cinnamon and mint are balanced by caramel, vanilla, and bright glazed fruit, with a lingering honey-rye finish. It leans more toward a rye whiskey than a bourbon in flavor profile. Sourced whiskey.",John Hansell,Summer 2015
89,Wemyss Malts Cacao Geyser (distilled at Bowmore) 1998,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,124,"Rich amber. A slight agricultural note to start, and although sweet and soft, also a little indistinct. This is a palate whisky, with plenty of integrated smoke, rich fruitcake, and, as its name suggests, plenty of chocolate. It fades quickly when neat. Water, surprisingly, rectifies this: the nose opens to show complex dark depths, while the palate is lengthened and given extra aromatic lift. Rich and rather lovely. £85",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
89,Jim Beam Signature Craft High Rye,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Can you say “11 year old Old Grand-Dad”? There’s a snap of hot, happy rye in the nose, sweet corn and cinnamon banging along, but there’s vanilla and oaky dryness. I had a bottle of OGD Bonded handy, and it’s close. It’s like my favorite young bonded strapped in oaky spice, with a more mature, drier finish. I’m told this has even more rye in the mashbill. If you like OGD, get this and see what more age does. Price is per 375 ml.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2015
89,Girvan Patent Still 30 year old,42.0,Single Grain Whisky,549,"The senior member of the Girvan range is very approachable, with a gorgeous nose like a hay meadow on a summer’s morning, while sucking honey-lemon lozenges. The fruitiness has mellowed, ripened, and softened with the extra aging. A thick, luscious, layered dram of toffee banana, sparkling orange peel, wood spices, ripe fruits, and banoffee pie lead to a mouth-coating conclusion of shimmering spiciness. This will fill you with joy and satisfaction. Grain can be this good. £375",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
89,Manhattan Moonshine Prohibition-Style Whiskey,,Craft Whiskey,45,"It’s hard to stand out in a sea of fairly bland moonshine, but Manhattan Moonshine manages to by moving beyond corn in their mashbill, with oat, rye, spelt, and malt. The result is an unaged whiskey that’s light, slightly sweet, and a symphony of cereal grains. The addition of the honey note from the oats is spot on and helps unite the grain flavors. A dash of spice creates balance and drives a dry finish. This is a wonderfully crafted and unique whiskey.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
89,The Whisky Exchange (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 16 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,114,"Smoky! Can you get dessert seaweed? Because that’s what this smells of. Candied ginger notes alongside a distinct salinity—think winkles—and in time a hint of verjus, even lanolin with water. The palate shows balanced smoke, paprika, then white pepper. The best smoky Bunna’ I’ve come across, showing maturity, balance, and no rubberiness. In time, there’s notes of old (refill) sherry cask. Released for the 2014 London Whisky Show but still commercially available. £75",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
89,Port Charlotte PC12,,Single Malt Scotch,168,"Distilled in 2002, here’s Port Charlotte with an assured maturity. Amber in color, with some smoke and a pleasing whiff of cowshed (sweet hay and cow’s breath), before rosehip syrup and ozonic freshness. Water brings out incense, cream, even a little nuttiness. The palate is gently complex; a drop of water is needed to calm the heat and reveal the smoke that interweaves between the layers. It retains its fresh acidic finish, with nutmeg, soft lemon, and pear. Excellent. £110",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
89,Forty Creek 2014 Evolution,43.0,Canadian,70,"A new direction for Forty Creek’s 8<sup>th</sup> annual release, which was aged 3 years, redistilled, then aged another 9 years. Quintessentially Canadian, it begins with Caramac candy bar, finishing in white pepper and bitter grapefruit pith. Not as lush as past releases, although the flavors remain a tightly woven panoply of fruit, spices, vegetal notes, and citrus zest. Gooseberries and lime on the nose become black currants on the palate as increasing hints of red wine come to dominate.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2014
89,Parker’s Heritage Collection Original Batch Wheat Whiskey 13 year old,,Wheat Whiskey,90,"Heaven Hill’s straight wheat whiskey, Bernheim Original, is a pleasant drink, but I always felt that some extra aging and a higher proof would give it additional richness and complexity to propel it to a higher level. That’s what this new expression accomplishes. Soothing, gentle layers of caramel-coated nuts, vanilla fudge, coconut cream, maple syrup, and marzipan, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and cocoa. So easy to embrace. Nicely done.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
89,Ardbeg Kildalton,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,191,"Not an unpeated Ardbeg, but a new initiative to raise money for the Kildalton Project which supports community projects in south Islay. Smoke, but also real sweetness: hothouse peaches, mezcal, smoked oyster, sphagnum moss, a huge hit of vetiver, and coal tar. The smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward, while the sweet core (with added raspberry and cream, and mint) moves to the back. A worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause. Buy for either reason; or both. £120",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
89,Double Barrel Ardbeg & Craigellachie,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,78,"If I had to back one of the protagonists in Douglas Laing’s latest Duel of the Phial, my money would be squarely on the Ardbeg. The nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper, coiled rope on a trawler’s deck, and hot pressed asphalt, with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire’s shortbread. Medium texture: lemon and butterscotch, delicious fruitiness, and spearmint on the mid-palate. Clean, creamy with a baked lemon finish. £49",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
89,Arran The Devil’s Punchbowl III The Fiendish Finale,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"The third and final expression in Arran’s Devil’s Punchbowl trilogy of limited releases is a multi-age bottling, matured in eight <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts, eight French oak <em>barriques</em>, and five bourbon barrels. Only 6,660 bottles are available. Figs, dates, citrus fruits, and honey on the nose, with developing savory notes. Silky sherry, lively cinnamon, and red berries on the palate, with a hint of wood smoke. Lengthy in the finish, with spicy oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
89,Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2008,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,83,"Bere is an ancient strain of barley which is stubbornly difficult to grow and mash. For this, Bruichladdich has gone to a specialist farm on Orkney. The nose is intriguingly aromatic, sweet and slightly corn-like, with a sweet nuttiness behind. It becomes very floral (night-scented stocks) with white currant, lemon sherbet, and a lift of tangerine before water brings out <em>sakura</em> (cherry blossom) syrup and bread. The palate is very sweet and concentrated. Remarkable. Keep watching. £52",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
89,Glengoyne 26 year old single cask #384 distilled 1987,,Single Malt Scotch,557,"This 26 year old single cask Glengoyne was matured in a first-fill European oak sherry butt that yielded 339 bottles. It offers a nose of sultanas, figs, and vanilla, plus white pepper and a hint of linseed. Succulent in the mouth, the palate yields sweet sherry, honey, and contrasting lemon juice and pepper. The finish is lengthy, but dries rapidly, with lively pepper, oak tannins, and a final fatty note. £350",Gavin Smith,Winter 2014
89,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2014 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,170,"The third cask strength release and, like all Angel’s Envy bourbons, this one is finished in port barrels. When compared to the standard bottling, this cask strength release is packed with more of everything. It’s lush and palate-coating. Fruit forward too, with honey-coated cherries, sultana, ripe peach, pineapple in syrup, peppered with clove and vanilla, and wrapped in a silky smooth finish. This whiskey pushes the envelope of port finishing.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
89,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Ardmore) 14 year old 2000 Cask #233,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"If you needed proof that Scotch whiskies don’t fit neatly into established categories, look no further than this marine style, peated Highland malt. Sea salt, oyster shells, and light smoke lead the nose, with hay and apricot underneath. In the entry, the flavors burst on the palate with sea salt, honey, malt, oak, and smoke. Peat smoke really builds in the mid-palate but manages not to lose the supporting flavors, although it becomes the real star of a long finish. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
89,Craigellachie 19 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,168,"Here, Craigellachie is slimmed down and appears in slightly leaner guise, with an aromatic spritz of vetiver-heavy male cologne coming across first before fresh fruits follow on. More crisp and with slightly more obvious toasted structure. The pineapple distillery character is now dried, before the palate shows sweet chocolate pudding, char, honeysuckle, herbs, and white fruits. A classy (and large) package. <em>(Travel Retail only) </em>€135/liter",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
89,Braunstein Library Collection 11-2,46.0,Danish,133,"Gently peated malt was distilled and matured in bourbon and new American oak casks by Claus and Michael Braunstein. A refined nose of smoked duck terrine, with fudge, gentle vanilla, and lime zest underneath. Rather elegant, with a note-perfect balance between the smoke and the sweetness. There’s a huge explosion of mandarin, Milka chocolate, sharp citrus, espresso, treacle, licorice, and dry, wrinkly dates. The finish of rich, black coffee is smooth, sultry, and long. 795kr",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
89,Hillrock Double Cask Rye Barrel 19,45.0,Craft Whiskey,90,"Rye spice is the first thing on the nose: cinnamon-spiked hard candy, hot and juicy. Beautifully oily and bitter rye character slides across the tongue on a wave of sweet caramel and vanilla. Young, but in the eager intensity of rye, not the clumsy heat of bourbon. Rye shines here, from the first whiff to the last bitter curl on the tongue, and the wood deftly sweetens and soothes. Nicely done.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
89,Celtic Cask Sé,46.0,Irish,242,"After 21 years in refill sherry, this whiskey was finished for 4 months in their preferred Mallorcan Ànima Negra barrels. Here, they achieve a sublime marriage of the sherry cask and finishing vessel, perfecting the aromas of fresh-sliced fig, sherry trifle, and crystalized pineapple. Tight and dense flavor, offering spangles, apricot jam, fragrant spices, raspberry, toffee, and maraschino cherry. Real quality and depth of character lasting through to the long, fruity finish of dates and stewed fruits. (328 bottles) €195",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
89,Kerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur,17.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,20,"Kerrygold is Ireland’s major player in the dairy business. Scored against other Irish cream liqueurs, this is highly rated. I’m smitten. The sweet chocolate is rich, delectable, and utterly gorgeous, with melting caramels slathered all over the taste buds, riding high on a wave of lush Irish cream. There are fruity notes of sultana and black cherry, expressed by the chocolate, which soar above the reliable foundation of Irish whiskey. Can you tell this won my heart? Do indulge.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
89,Wild Turkey Diamond,,Bourbon/Tennessee,125,"A marriage of 13 to 16 year old bourbons honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell’s 60 years at Wild Turkey. It is a more conservative Turkey compared to many of the previous limited-edition releases. But still, this is pleasant, with caramel and creamy vanilla intertwined with soft candied orange, cinnamon, polished oak, and a hint of evergreen. Nicely balanced, very approachable, but I would have preferred this at their signature 101 proof for added intensity.",John Hansell,Fall 2014
89,Ar4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Ardbeg),,Single Malt Scotch,151,"A touch of damp dunnage, some Ardbeggian soot, and plenty of jalapeño-style heat. Shows maturity and depth of character, with just-dead bonfire, ointment, and a sweetness, which here is like honeycomb. Water makes it bolder, with deeper smoke, while the palate has sweet wood, balanced (cigar-accented) smoke, and layers of salt, angelica, and plum. £90/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
89,Arran Malt 17 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,120,"As Arran continues on its trajectory toward introducing an 18 year old expression, just 9,000 bottles of sherry cask-matured 17 year old have been released. Bottled at 46%, it has not been chill filtered. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with ripe pineapples, green apples, malt, and a hint of licorice. Luscious and nicely-textured on the palate. Lots of orchard fruits, sherry, and soft toffee. Mild spice and hedgerow fruitiness in the slightly drying, lengthy finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
89,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1974 (Cask #8579),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Although from a refill, the mahogany color suggests a short previous use. Some nose burn, with a mature edge of leather and dark chocolate. Here’s Glenfarclas in a darker guise, with raisin and a savory aspect; think roast pheasant and walnuts, lamb and mint sauce. The palate is big, thick, and sweet with lots of extract, but also Turkish delight, sultana, and prune. While sherried, it’s not in any way overcooked; the tannins are balanced, the sweetness massive. £625",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
89,Glenglassaugh Massandra Connection 41 year old Sherry Wood Finish,,Single Malt Scotch,1087,"The Massandra winery, which supplies casks for Glenglassaugh’s Massandra Connection bottlings, is the oldest in Crimea, and reputedly produced Tsar Alexander III’s favorite wines. The 1973 distillation, which has been finished in sherry casks, has a nose of sultanas, cinnamon, sweet grass, and herbal notes in the background. Bung cloth, char, and finally damp undergrowth. Complex aromatic progression. Mouth-coating, with sweet, spicy tropical fruit notes and <em>oloroso</em>. Slowly drying, with bitter orange and mild tannins at the close. £645",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
89,Lp5 Elements of Islay (distilled at Laphroaig),,Single Malt Scotch,118,"Bold, with smoked fish (Arbroath smokies), dried fruits. Has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. A lemon edge adds some lift. The complexity continues on the tongue, which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. Long, balanced, and thick in the center, with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
89,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Linkwood) 14 year old 1999 Cask # 978,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"From a Speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. An enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey, acidic dried orange, rich walnut, and light smoke. On the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. Things get spicy in the mid-palate, with black pepper, salt, ginger, and a bump in smoke. A long finish rounds everything off, showcasing smoke and orange. Lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
89,Nikka Coffey Malt,45.0,Japanese,72,"Now a hugely welcome part of the core range, this whisky—made in Coffey stills at the Miyagikyo distillery—uses 100% malted barley as its base. The nose is all tinned peach, tropical fruit juice, and baked banana, with a surprising green celery note, coconut, and sherbet. The palate is silky, with some chocolate, biscuity oak, and orange blossom honey. Water brings those green notes forward to add freshness to the peach cobbler sweetness. The grain revolution builds. £43",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
89,Knob Creek Smoked Maple,45.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,32,"Booze candy from Beam? More like bacon in a glass: the sweet smokiness invaded my dining room (definitely the last tasting of the day). Richly smoky-sweet, with a clear balance of maple over corn; like a rustic breakfast of bacon, pancakes, and whiskey! The maple’s restrained and authentic, the 45% keeps it from being too sweet, and there’s plenty of good bourbon flavor here, especially at the finish. Lush, tasty; if you have to do flavors, here’s how.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
89,Kornog Sant Ivy 2014,,French Whisky,127,"A cask strength expression of Kornog showing great maturity, yet born from Glann ar Mor’s small pot stills and condensed through the coils of their worm tubs. The smoke is beguiling; sweet and aromatic with tokens of vanilla and an underlying faceful of Atlantic sea spray. It is sweet, fruit-led—especially mango—though the alcohol never dominates, more like a sunburst through a cloud. The finish is moreish, returning to the salt, which only makes you thirsty for another pour. €95",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
89,The Irishman Founder’s Reserve,40.0,Irish,30,"This is a 70/30 blend of aged single malt whiskey and single pot still whiskey (though no grain whiskey), matured in bourbon barrels for around 7 to 9 years. Revel in the spicy aromas of clove, cinnamon, and star anise balanced with green apple, blossom honey, and dry, oily vanilla pods. The mouthfeel is weighty and dense from the pot still, yet rich in honey, spice, and vanilla, with a tongue-enveloping finish of custard cream biscuits.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
89,Jim Beam Single Barrel,,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"More oak, intensity, depth, maturity, and character than the standard Jim Beam white. Darker sugars too, showing more caramel and light toffee, less honeyed corn and vanilla (although those notes are certainly still present). Subtle mint and cinnamon spice, along with soft fruit and light tobacco on the finish round out the flavor profile. A bourbon comfortably positioned between Jim Beam white and the more premium Signature Series releases.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
89,Telsington Black Edition 5 year old,,Liechtenstein,325,"The historic Telser distillery has been producing spirits for generations. Their pride and joy: a triple distilled whisky produced in two wood-fired stills before being matured wholly in French oak <em>barriques</em> that previously contained Pinot Noir. There are overripe melons, powdery icing sugar, and an unobtrusive jamminess on the nose. The flavorsome palate hits you with bright yellow fruits, then twists brilliantly to divulge deep orange and peeled plum skin balanced with gingerbread (<em>available in Lichtenstein, Germany, Switzerland, and online</em>) CHF 290",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
89,Overeem Sherry Matured Cask Strength,60.0,Australian Whisky,319,"First of two bottlings. The Old Hobart distillery used 100-liter sherry French oak quarter casks to create this beauty. Hediard fruit jellies (blackcurrant, quince, and mango), nutmeg, cassia, hot sand, and caramelized biscuits. The sherry gives a willowy soft opener, with tobacco, bitter plums, and Earl Grey tea bleeding out to dark toffees, espresso, and a Flemish biscuit note. Water produces a cappuccino finish. For the alcohol content, the pair are similarly priced, but this one offers greater rewards. £189",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
89,The Maltman (distilled at Ben Nevis) 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"This 17 year old independent bottling of Ben Nevis has somewhat unusually been matured in a <i>fino</i> sherry cask, rather than the more common <i>oloroso</i> or PX.   The nose offers initial milk chocolate notes, then a whiff of cold roast pork and oak. In time, strawberry and mango aromas appear. The mouthfeel is pleasingly full, decidedly gingery, with caramel and dry sherry. Spicy, mild sherry and raisins in a long, lively finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
89,Tweeddale 12 year old Batch 3,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,68,"Alasdair Day is on a mission to build a new Lowland distillery in the Borders of Scotland. While we wait, the next batch from his grandfather’s cellar book is a pale, golden dram with a delectable nose of lemon meringue pie, spring blossoms, peach pit, candy floss, and Valrhona Ivoire white chocolate. This is more-ish whisky: like spooning into panna cotta. Pear syrup, white chocolate, and a sizzle of toasted muffins dissipate into a mild ginger and gooseberry finish. £40",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
89,The Exceptional Grain,43.0,Grain Scotch Whisky,100,"The debut release from Don Sutcliffe&#039;s Sutcliffe &amp; Sons, this small-batch blend of grain whiskies comes from several different distilleries including Loch Lomond, North British, and a 30 year old whisky from Carsebridge. The blend is married in first-fill sherry casks, which brings bright fruit to a fairly light whisky with notes of blackberry, vanilla, honey, light oak, and iris. Quite good for a grain whisky blend, but falls just short of being exceptional. (<i>U.S. only</i>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
89,Arran Malt The Millennium Casks,,Single Malt Scotch,108,"The Millennium Casks is a non-chill filtered vatting of 45 Arran casks filled on December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000; 35 bourbon barrels and 10 sherry hogsheads. A spicy, floral nose with sherry, honey, coconut ice, orange, fudge, and ultimately raisin notes. Smooth and luscious on the palate, with apple pie and custard, plus a sprinkling of cinnamon. Long and spicy in the finish, with oranges, a hint of black pepper, licorice, and drying oak. <i>(7,800 bottles). </i>£65",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
89,Caol Ila Stitchell Reserve,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Caol Ila in unpeated guise. There’s no age statement, but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh Victoria plum, grapes, and a hint of oiliness. Give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s, with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. The palate is equally sweet and gentle, and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. A wee beauty.",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
89,Glen Garioch Vintage 1999,,Single Malt Scotch,98,"This limited edition release of Glen Garioch is the first from the Aberdeenshire distillery to have been matured entirely in <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks. Just 1,000 cases of the 14 year old expression are available globally. Old leather, slightly earthy, sultanas, white pepper, and a hint of lemon pith on the nose. The palate is big and bold, with more pepper, plus cinnamon caramel, orange, and abundant sherry. Enduring spice, licorice, and slightly smoky raisins in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
89,The Exclusive Malts 8 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 2005 vintage (Cask  #484),,Single Malt Scotch,85,"This whisky shows no signs of immaturity considering its age. Indeed, enjoying Laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. Very medicinal and “closed up” neat, but comes alive with a splash of water. Powerful notes of tar, charcoal, smoked seaweed, and licorice root, mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. Warm, smoky, charred oak finish. <i>(U.S. only)</i>",John Hansell,Spring 2014
89,Lp4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Laphroaig),,Single Malt Scotch,108,"A very tarry start, like fence posts which have just been treated with creosote. Add in some smoked fish alongside dried grass, and you have all the requisite elements for a classic Laphroaig. The palate is massively smoky to start, a real peat bomb, but that eruption recedes, allowing barley and sweetness to come through. This is a serious dram which needs water to coat the tongue. Very good. £65/500 ml",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
89,Oban 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,625,"The first Diageo Special Releases Oban to be released since 2004 has been matured in rejuvenated American oak and second-fill bodega casks. The outturn is 2,860 bottles. Tinned peaches, ginger, caramel, and newly-sawn wood on the nose, with an accompanying marine note. Syrupy in the mouth, very sweet and spicy, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and baked apple. Contrast is provided by a splash of brine. Spicy in the drying finish, with ginger to the fore, plus more sea salt.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
89,Mackmyra Moment Mareld,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,183,"This is the thirteenth release in this series and we&#039;ve reviewed about five of them; they have been very hit and miss, but the general trend has definitely been upward. These are casks selected by Angela D&#039;Orazio, and they show what a diverse distillery Mackmyra has become. This is a dessert and cigar whisky, with melon, banana, and vanilla at one end, and chili spice and earthy, smoky malt at the other. Excellent. £110",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
89,Amrut Kadhambam,50.0,Indian Whisky,85,"Proof, if it were still needed, that Amrut intends to cement its position as the leading innovator in world whisky. Kadhambam is the sweetest of Amruts, as a result of a complex maturation process that has seen peated Amrut matured in local brandy and rum casks. There&#039;s a liqueur-like edge to it as a result, but it&#039;s a complex malt, with cherry blossom, peppercorn, and apple peel in the mix. Not the distillery&#039;s best, but very, very drinkable.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
89,Signatory (distilled at Balmenach) 1988,,Single Malt Scotch,140,"It’s a crying shame that this great distillery is so rarely seen. Here, a bourbon cask has reduced the meatiness and amplified the fruity component, but these are fruits with depth and power, allied to dried flowers. The mango-like sweetness is reduced to syrup; there’s light plum jam and some old paper. Sweet on the tongue, with crystallized ginger, apricot, and a finish of spice, and the strange sweetness of licorice root. <i>(The Whisky Exchange only.) </i>£84",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
89,Abraham Bowman Port Finished Bourbon 12 year old,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Quite lush—the port influence is clearly obvious and adds a degree of opulence to this bourbon. Notes of ripe cherry dipped in caramel, then light molasses, blend in with more traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and spice. A pleasant diversion from the bourbon norm, and ideal for postprandial consumption. (It begs for a fine cigar, for those inclined.)",John Hansell,Spring 2014
89,Brenne Estate Cask (Cask #258),40.0,French Whisky,55,"Brenne is from the Cognac region of France and is becoming an American success story, having been launched stateside by Allison Patel, but little known elsewhere. After 6 years in French oak, 2 years in a Cognac barrel, and reduced by the local water to 40%, the result is a delicate, almost floral, eucalyptus and rosewater delight, with honeycomb and sweet spice. Very different from a standard malt, but very good all the same.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
89,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 115,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"More caramelized sugars (caramel and toffee), with darker fruit than the 105 and 90. More oak spice influence too, but balanced nicely by the sweeter notes. Mouth-coating, viscous, and lubricating in texture. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
89,Arran The Devil’s Punch Bowl Chapter II: Angels & Devils,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Chapter II of Arran’s The Devil’s Punch Bowl embraces whisky from a total of 27 casks. These are seventeen <i>oloroso</i> sherry hogsheads (from 1997 and ’98), six standard bourbon barrels (2002), and four peated bourbon casks (2004). Juicy dark berries, malt, and soft cinnamon on the nose. Robust and fruity on the palate, with more dark berries, plain chocolate, a suggestion of vanilla, and black pepper. Long and drying in the earthy, mildly smoky finish, with aniseed and licorice.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
89,Bruichladdich Black Art 4 23 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,322,"A mélange of casks and techniques that only Jim McEwan knows about. The fourth iteration of his Black Art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews, a sprinkling of rose water, dried mango, rosehip syrup, and potpourri. The palate opens to Parma violets, underpinned with light lavender, where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey, pomegranate, apricot pits, and dried lemon. It pushes malt into a new area, but that’s the point. £200",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
89,Thorfinn,,Single Malt Scotch,1348,"More obviously sherried on the nose than either Sigurd or Ragnvald; buttery, with figs, sultanas, vanilla, a hint of leather, and ripe oranges. Rich and silky on the complex palate; overt sherry, ginger, and lots of old leather and sweet smoke. Spice is quite muted here. The finish is lengthy, with plain chocolate, wood smoke, figs, and tingling spices. Luxurious and accomplished. (<i>Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>€1,000",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
89,Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Longmorn) 1996,,Single Malt Scotch,154,"Immediately identifiably Longmorn: that ridiculous, highly amenable mix of soft fruits, masses of sweet spice, candied peels, coconut, and sticky toffee pudding. In fact, it’s almost over the top in its lushness. Leans into the mouth with masses of mace, then soft fruits and marzipan develop. Unctuous, long, and ripe, the wood shows just a little, but the depth and richness holds it in check. Very good. £97",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
89,Adelphi 22 year old (distilled at Macallan),56.0,Single Malt Scotch,151,"Initially, this is Macallan in effusive Willy Wonka mood, with lots of toffee, chocolate, greengage, and light oiliness. The aroma thickens with water, and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. The palate is equally rich and layered, with cereal, black cherry, discreet oak. A complex mix, as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
89,Talisker Dark Storm,,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Described as the smokiest whisky produced at Talisker, Dark Storm is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets, and maturation has taken place in deeply charred casks. Rich, fruity spices on the nose, quite citric, with brine and aromatic smoke. The smoke elbows its way to the fore in time. Full, sweet, fruity flavors on the palate, some vanilla, then smoke, licorice, and spice hit home. A classic Talisker smoke and chili finish, but cranked up a notch or two! £45/1 liter",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
89,Hakushu Heavily Peated,48.0,Japanese,150,"Last year saw the release of the Yamazaki “component” range, examples of the cask types that help make up its single malt releases. Now, Hakushu has joined in. The name doesn’t lie, this is very smoky, heathery, fragrant with orris-like dryness alongside Hakushu’s classic vegetal notes of elderflower, bamboo, and moorland grass. The palate shows praline, ripe lychee, and kiwi working alongside this mix of integrated smoke and clean focus. It also makes a fantastic Hiball.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
89,Balcones True Blue 100,50.0,Craft Whiskey,58,"Made from roasted Hopi blue corn. The nose says bourbon—sweet, corn, faint maple—but with big notes of stone fruits. It's lush. Mouth veers off in another direction with floury corn, oaked complexity, an herbal component, like crushed stems of wildflowers, and cinnamon/allspice notes. The finish is suddenly mellow, with a seductive creaminess high in the back palate. Even at a young 50%, never really fiery. Wonderfully complex, and not over-oaked; beautiful stuff.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2013
89,Springbank Refill Sherry 17 year old,57.0,Single Malt Scotch,200,"Even with a refill sherry cask, bright fruit is the main theme to this whisky: strawberry-rhubarb pie, red raspberry preserve, red currant. But there’s honeyed malt for balance, along with suggestions of

coconut macaroon, marzipan, brine, and glazed ginger to keep things interesting. Distinctive. <i>(U.S. exclusive)</i>",John Hansell,Fall 2013
89,Tamdhu 10 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,52,"A very welcome arrival from new owners Ian MacLeod, this has been aged in sherry

wood. As a result, you can’t help comparing it to Macallan and while there’s

none of the oily depths, there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple before

some resin and warm leather develop, but no sulfur. Some of the richness is

lost with water, so I’d leave it as is. This is a stunner for a 10 year old and

is marked accordingly. Value Pick £34<b>  </b>",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
89,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof 12 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Quite dark in color, turning cloudy with water. Don’t let that deter you. A thick, chewy bourbon, with layers of nutty toffee,

nougat, cocoa, and toasted marshmallow, peppered with cinnamon and vanilla. Oak and leather on the finish dry out the whiskey nicely. Not the most refined bourbon, but the flavors it delivers make up for it.",John Hansell,Fall 2013
89,Poit Dhubh 21 year old Blended Malt,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,120,"Pronounced “Pot Doo,” this is without doubt a rugged coastal and/or island whisky, but on a mild and temperate day. Salt, spice, and peat are all to the fore, but it’s a gentle giant of a whisky, with some citrus drizzle and a light honeycomb heart. The main wood influence seems to soften the delivery so that the punch it packs won’t floor you. Beautifully put together, though.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
89,Booker’s (Batch No. C06-B-15),,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Aged 7 years, 1 month, and 7 days. Big and chewy, with nutty toffee, molasses, nougat, tobacco, pencil shavings, subtle

fruit, and dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla). Leather, barrel char, and a hint of licorice root on the finish. Big, bold, and very enjoyable.",John Hansell,Fall 2013
89,F.E.W. Rye,,Craft Whiskey,60,"Solid, chunky bottle with idiosyncratic whiskey inside. Straightforward rye crisps out of the glass in no-nonsense style; dry grain, sweet grass, and light but insistent anise almost wholly drown out the

barrel character. The mouth is as dry and spicy-medicinal as the nose hints at, laying down character like a winning hand: rye SNAP! heat SNAP! light tarragon SNAP! oak SNAP! and a warm wrap-up finish SNAP! Full house, flavors over sensations. Clean <i>and</i> interesting. Nicely played.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2013
89,Balblair 1969 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This veteran Balblair was distilled on February 7, 1969 using barley malted on site and coal-fired stills. Just 999 bottles have been released. Opens with slight saltiness on the nose, almost ozone, then lemons and pine, and finally, vanilla fudge. Overt citrus notes on the palate, with aniseed, some oak, brittle toffee, and a smokiness not found in younger Balblairs. The finish is long and discreetly spicy, notably cinnamon and black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
89,Talisker Storm,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with cranberries and black currants, while peat smoke is always present, plus black pepper. The finish lingers, with walnuts and fruity peat. £40",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
89,Cutty Sark Cask Strength,,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Blended whiskies have taken a sexy turn for the better, and there have been some excellent attempts to innovate. Indeed, a gap has opened up between main label blends and this sort of thing, which is particularly brave because a world-class brand has let amateurs loose on it. That said, this is massive, with big earthy spice, peat, and sour fruits. There's some youthful sappiness in the mix, too, but it's not detrimental. Brave and impressive.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
89,Teeling Small Batch,46.0,Irish,44,"The first conventional release from this fledgling company. Irish whiskey&#039;s equivalent to a seemingly frothy sweet pop song, which on closer inspection has barbed and cutting lyrics. It&#039;s a sweet Irish blend and seems like it. But it has a high malt content, is packed with flavor, and it easily justifies its price. It&#039;s creamy and rich with toffee notes, there&#039;s some tropical fruit and delicious rum-and-raisin milk chocolate. Not too cloying despite the sweetness, either. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
89,Auchentoshan 1979 Oloroso Sherry Matured,,Single Malt Scotch,550,"The latest release in Auchentoshan’s 1970s Vintage Series is this expression, distilled on October 22, 1979 and matured in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for 32 years. Just 1,000 bottles are available (12 bottles for the U.S.). Sweet on the nose, with furniture polish, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and a faint whiff of old leather. Big tropical fruit notes open the palate, soon turning to smoky blackcurrants, tea, and rich fruit loaf. The finish is spicy, featuring black pepper, tobacco, dark berries, and plain chocolate.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
89,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2012 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"A limited-edition (600 bottles), cask strength version of Angel’s Envy. More alcohol and more portwood influence than that standard release. Rich and lush in texture, with a sweet personality. Notes of ripe berried fruit, maple syrup, honeyed tangerine, vanilla, and background spice. Distinctive, with a soothing, velvety finish. I’d prefer less port influence, more aligned with the standard release, but it’s still a very enjoyable bourbon. Best after dinner, with a cigar.",John Hansell,Spring 2013
89,Abraham Bowman Port Finished Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,,"One of the debut whiskeys at WhiskyFest New York 2012, this was finished in a barrel that held Virginia-made port…after it was used to age Bowman whiskey, a boomerang finish. The nose gives baking chocolate, tropical flowers, and yes, some of that port. Peppery and port-edged on the tongue, solid fire from the 100 proof, fat corn and fruit in the middle of the palate. Busy, but purposeful. There’s a lot here and it’s all working together.  ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
89,Russell’s Reserve Small Batch Single Barrel,55.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Clean on the palate, with honey-kissed citrus, summer fruits, crisp mint, and cinnamon, balanced by creamy vanilla and soft toffee. A solid bourbon that’s nicely rounded and vibrant. It’s very much with the current trend of American whiskeys toward no age statement; youthful and playful in nature, and versatile.",John Hansell,Spring 2013
89,Century Reserve Lot 15/25,40.0,Canadian,,"Sweet citrus fruits, floral overtones, and assertive peppery spices interlace a generous framework of silky oak tannins. Charred oak and pencil shavings hint at new oak, while the frosty crispness of dry autumn leaves confirms that at least some of this whisky has spent decades in reused barrels. Touches of almond skins and peach pits cleanse the late palate. Otherwise regal and elegant, this whisky is just a touch woody.  C$30 ",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
89,Old Hobart Overeem Port Cask Matured,60.0,Australian Whisky,,"Last year’s cask strength version was 55% and way too young. There is also a view that the early stages of maturation in port are not only inconsistent, but can be negatively wayward. No such problems here. This is no longer an ugly duckling but a young swan: rich fruitcake, fresh summer fruits, and a charcoal undercarpet that helps quash the overly sweet notes. This then is the world's most improved whisky. A$170",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
89,Jura Camas an Staca 30 year old,44.0,Single Malt Scotch,560,"The latest addition to the Jura range has been matured in American white oak casks before spending three years in Gonzalez Byass oloroso sherry butts. The mellow nose is lightly oily, with figs, sherry, orange, and a savory note. Vanilla emerges, along with malt, and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. Soft and supple on the palate, with more orange, plus cocoa, sultanas, and dates. The finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate, raisins, aniseed, and subtle spices. ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
89,Glen Scotia 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,145,"The nose offers tinned peaches, fresh ginger, and a slightly herbal note. The palate is voluptuous, with vanilla, malt, vigorous spices, and white chocolate. Lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
89,Paul John Single Malt,57.0,Indian Whisky,,"A cask strength, single cask bottling available through one UK outlet, this is still worthy of inclusion because it's further proof that India and Asia have the potential to produce world-class malts. This is just 3 years old but it's blemish-free and packed with flavor. Orange, lemon, and berries battle it out with jasmine, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and although my sample is marked 'unpeated' and a fully peated version is planned for 2013, there's still some earthiness at the core. Very good indeed. £60",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
89,Ardbeg Day,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Let it be known that from now on, June 2nd will be Ardbeg Day. That’s fine by me, as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges, lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. The palate is oily, sweet, and very deep. A growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13,000 bottles.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
89,The Dalmore 1973 38 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Primary maturation took place in an ex-bourbon cask, then from 2006 in a cask sourced from the vineyard of Chateau Haut Marbuzet, previously used to hold Cabernet Sauvignon. A final three years were spent in a newly-emptied bourbon barrel. Gingerbread, summer berries, and fig rolls on the nose. Fudge and vanilla. Black cherries, raisins, lots of lively spice, and a red wine ‘edge’ in the mouth. Freshly-baked ginger cake in the long, spicy finish. Cask number 10; 223 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
89,The Dalmore 1991 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"After initial maturation in American white oak, this 1991 expression was filled into a 15 year old Lepanto brandy cask from Gonzales Byass in May 2003, ultimately being re-racked into a fresh ‘distillery run’ bourbon barrel in August 2009. Caramel and white chocolate on the nose, malt, fudge, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then burnt treacle and hot brandy. Malt, sweet spice, almonds, bananas, and fudge on the palate. Spicy fruits in the lengthy Armagnac-like finish. Cask number 1; 233 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
89,Glen Garioch Cask No. 986 13 year old,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a whisky. Meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. Very straightforward on the surface (no surprises), but with vibrant, well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. Bright fruit defines this whisky (lime, kiwi, ripe melon, sultana, fresh peach), accompanied by honeyed malt, heather, and a hint of spice and smoke. A fun whisky, suitable for many moods and occasions. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) ",John Hansell,Fall 2012
89,Glenury Royal 40 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A belated addition to Diageo’s Special Releases range for 2011, this offering is from the now-demolished distillery in Stonehaven, which closed in 1985. Just 1,500 bottles are available, and maturation has taken place in American oak refill casks filled in 1970. Resin, malt, nutmeg, and wood polish on the nose, with developing vanilla and brittle toffee. Full in the mouth, slightly oily, and notably fruity, with heather and cinnamon notes. Pepper and bitter orange in the long finish. £525",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
89,Cutty Sark Storm,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Cutty Sark master blender Kirsteen Campbell has hit the ground running and is playing a leading role in the revival of this iconic blend. Storm is a very different whisky than Tam o' Shanter. The nose is nuanced and light, with orange jelly and citrus juice; the palate is sophisticated, fruity, perfectly balanced, rounded, and gentle, with a high-percentage malt content evident in the mix. The finish is quite short but very more-ish. An amazing whisky for the price. £20 VALUE PICK",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
89,Clan Denny Speyside,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"If big smoke and peat don't float your boat and you'd rather metaphorically skip through a summer orchard while drinking whisky, then the Speyside version of Clan Denny is the full fruit bowl. The mixing of malts means that sherry and bourbon Speysiders get a say, so it's the complete package, and there's lots going on. Ultimately, though, it's not quite as focused as the Islay. Damn close call, though.€36",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
89,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Barrel Proof,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The fourth in a series of limited-edition Taylor bottlings, and the first barrel-proof release. Layered sweet notes of caramel and nougat, with bright orchard fruit (especially nectarine), dried spice (vanilla, mint), and pencil shavings. The dried spice notes linger on the finish, along with tobacco. Bourbon with attitude.",John Hansell,Fall 2012
89,Knappogue Castle Twin Wood 17 year old 1994 Vinatge,40.0,Irish Single Malt,100,"Finished in sherry casks, which contribute lush red berried fruit, strawberry/rhubarb crumb pie, and candied ginger on top of honeyed malt, vanilla wafer, nougat, and warming spice. Oily texture, with resinous oak on the finish. Good balance with plenty of character. After years of younger Knappogue releases, I’ve really been enjoying the more recent older bottlings like this one. (Allocated mostly to the U.S.)",John Hansell,Summer 2012
89,Caol Ila 12 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Funny to think how recently Caol Ila was an Islay giant that was kept pretty much under wraps by its owner. These days it has cemented its reputation as the island’s Mr. Consistent. This version shows its character the best, a nose that mixes seashore and grass with a distinct hint of smoked bacon. The peatiness isn’t dominant, but flows throughout the palate, scenting, lifting, and subtly changing the mix. A delicious oiliness makes it a great food whisky.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
89,Cragganmore Distillers Edition 1997,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. A period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. The black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. Think cherry pipe tobacco, clove, and dark fruits. Sweet, but not too sweet, and always identifiably Cragganmore. For me, the pick of the bunch.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
89,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1982 (Cask #4567),56.0,Single Malt Scotch,329,"Amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness, this time mixed with a little cereal. The same dry grass you get on the 1981, but here there’s a nutty, biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. The palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper, that changes into blackberry as it opens. Needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully, which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. Clean but rich — that’s Glenfarclas. (A U.S. exclusive.)",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
89,Glenfiddich Cask of Dreams,,Single Malt Scotch,99,"A vatting of different ages of Glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in American oak, then married in virgin American oak casks on which folk from the States had written their hopes and dreams…Awww! Deliciously fruity and clean, it’s all pear juice, crème brûlée, fudge, cool mint, and dessert apple. With water, there’s dusty cinnamon, kiwi, and milk chocolate. The oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. A lovely idea and a lovely whisky.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
89,A.D. Rattray (distilled at Highland Park) 19 year old 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Many of the independent  H.P. bottlings are aged in bourbon casks, and, like this one, exhibit creamy vanilla, honeyed malt, and citrus. I’m also picking up some more subtle heather, brine, coconut, and nougat. This one is clean on the palate and shows nice balance, with enough dry oak on the finish to counter the whisky’s sweeter notes. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.) ",John Hansell,Summer 2012
89,"Old Pulteney WK209 ‘Good Hope,’ 46%",,Single Malt Scotch,,"WK209 is named after a steam herring drifter registered in the Caithness port of Wick, where Old Pulteney is distilled. This limited edition, travel retail exclusive was matured entirely in first fill European oak sherry casks for 8 to 10 years. Milk chocolate, crème brûlée, old leather, and sherry on the nose, contrasting with brine. Sherry, dried fruits, black pepper, English mustard, and sea salt on the full palate. Spicy sherry, heather, and black coffee in the luxurious finish. €50",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
89,Wemyss Malts ‘Winter Spice’ Single Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This cask strength, 29 year old 1982 expression in the Wemyss Malts range is the company’s first bottling of a single malt distilled at the Northern Highland distillery of Teaninich. Just 201 bottles have been released. The insistently fruity nose features overripe pears, heather in bloom, soft fudge, salted popcorn, cinnamon, and ginger. Soft and peachy on the palate, with darker spice notes, walnuts, and plain chocolate. The finish is lengthy, with more plain chocolate and some spiced oak. £110",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
89,Southern Coast Single Malt Cask 4,46.0,Australian Whisky,,"Southern Coast Distillers is part of a new wave of distillers in Victoria, South Australia, and unlike many fledgling distilleries who bottle too early and learn their trade in public view, with blemished, linseed-sappy malt, this distillery has hit the ground running and is already making fabulous whisky. There isn't an off note here, and it combines lemon sherbet bonbons, honeyed vanilla, bitter dark chocolate, licorice, and some pepper. Delightful. A$110",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
89,Evan Williams Single Barrel 2002 Vintage,,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"Very straightforward and unassuming. Its greatest assets are its balance and drinkability, rather than its flavors. Lovely sweet notes (caramel, vanilla), orchard fruit, golden raisin, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, dusting of cocoa), leading to a smooth finish. Not the most distinctive or complex of the single barrel releases, but just a joy to drink. In fact, this is almost too drinkable. It’s a whiskey I feel would show better at a higher strength (say, 45% or even 50%).",John Hansell,Spring 2012
89,Highland Park 1976 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is a recent addition to the portfolio, and has been matured in a mixture of thirteen American oak butts and hogsheads. These have given an out-turn of 893 bottles. Freshly-grated ginger, white pepper, and melons on the nose. Soft fruit and spices feature on the palate, with honey and coconut oil, plus background peat smoke. Lively spices, soft oak, and hazelnuts in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
89,The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Pe5 (distilled at Port Ellen),,Single Malt Scotch,,"This, the fifth of TWE’s ongoing Elements bottlings of Islay’s legendary closed distillery, does not disappoint. The nose is akin to salted chocolate, with a wasabi-like earthiness lurking behind. Port Ellen’s characteristic flintiness is there in the form of rock-pools and hot sand inside seashells, while the smoke hints at sphagnum moss, marsh gas, and burnt cake. The palate has touches of smoked eel and a hint of pear. As enigmatic as ever, in other words. £175 (500 ml)",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
89,Rosebank 21 year old 1990 (Diageo Special Releases 2011),,Single Malt Scotch,,"2011 saw the first expression of Rosebank appear in Diageo’s annual Special Releases series, and just 5,604 bottles are available worldwide. The bottling is comprised of whisky matured in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Floral and mildly herbal on the nose, with cereal and tropical fruit notes, along with a hint of damp soil. The palate is somewhat tart, with oranges and pepper, while the finish dries to coffee and spicy oak. A lovely example of a much-mourned malt. ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
89,Spicebox,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Tons of vanilla and sweet custard in the nose, enough to make the mouth water, and not fake-smelling at all. Once again, the 40% makes a difference: light and sweet in the mouth, like a glass of creme brulee eau de vie! I'd enjoyed the sweet vanilla-spice character so much that the whisky slipping in at the end was almost a shock, but it's there, and even adds a bit of mint and fire. Embarrassingly tasty. ",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
89,Balblair 2000,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The 2000 vintage of Balblair is intended to replace the well-regarded 1997 variant. Matured in first-fill American oak, this very drinkable expression represents good value for the money. A pretty peach and pineapple nose, with coconut and honeyed vanilla. Toasted marshmallows with time. Relatively light-bodied, sweet, with lively spice, ginger, and youthful oak on the relatively complex palate. Fudge in the finish, and a contrasting hint of dark chocolate at the last.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
89,Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Mortlach) 1989 21 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Immediately identifiable as Mortlach, with a pleasant, feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. There is elegant sweetness here, but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan, with honey. The palate, unsurprisingly, is big, and medium dry, but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. Mortlach, but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
89,Scotch Malt Whisky Society (28:23) 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This bottling of Tullibardine was distilled in November 1989 and has been matured in a refill sherry butt. The U.S. allocation is 120 bottles. Initially, damp earth on the nose, sweetening to milk chocolate-covered fudge and vanilla, along with hazelnuts. Notes of plum and black pepper with time. The palate is fruity, with toffee, spice, and cedar wood notes. Long in the finish, with cereal and spicy resin. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
89,Longmorn 16 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Longmorn may be slightly better known, but it’s still pretty much a cult whisky — with a huge following in Japan, where every whisky bar seems to have multiple expressions. This bottling shows it in its lushest guise, with masses of caramelized soft fruits, banana, cream toffee, and chocolate. The palate shifts between raisin and plum. Elegant. ",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
89,Springbank 11 year old,58.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Finished in a rum cask. Gently sweet (caramel, vanilla cream, kiss of honey), with balancing fruit (lime, kiwi, green grape) and spice (white pepper, brine). Youthful (but not immature). Invigorating briny finish. I don’t know what kind of rum cask was used, but it comes across more like sugar cane juice-based rhum agricole than the molasses-based rums. Very nice! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
89,Cutty Sark 18 year old,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Cutty Sark lost its way in recent years; expect that to change soon. Its owners have plans to return it to glory (and to include a 30 year old among its expressions — you read it here first). For the time being — if you can find it — this 18 year old is a sublime mix of soft plum and peach, sweet, pure grain, easy-drinking vanilla, and a deft oakiness all delivered in gentle and harmonious fashion. Masterful blending.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
89,Kilchoman Spring 2011 release,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A marriage of 3 and 4 year old whisky aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, with the 4 year old portion being finished in oloroso sherry casks. Among the best of the Kilchoman releases to date. The first-fill bourbon packs a flavor punch, while the sherry softens, rounds, and adds complexity. Barrel char, burnt raisin, boat dock, and tarry rope, softened by caramel and enhanced with notes of tropical fruit. Surprisingly mature for its age and very distinctive. ",John Hansell,Fall 2011
89,Lark Single Cask,58.0,Australian Whisky,,"Lark is on Australia’s frontline, but this is a hard sell. This is big bucks for untried whisky. No doubt though, this is history in the making. There’s a big cinnamon and nutmeg kick to this, and with water, a rootsy, sweet apple core and a menthol hit wrap themselves around flavors of crab apples and dates. It’s different, easy to like, and exciting. Australian whisky is on a roll. AUD220 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
89,"Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection “Rediscovered Barrels,” 1989 vintage",,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"A surprising amount of sweetness to balance the wood spice. Notes of pencil shavings, glazed fruit, candy corn, vanilla fudge, and bold polished leather on the finish.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
89,BenRiach Solstice 15 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,87,"A heavily peated BenRiach that has been finished in a tawny port pipe. The nose is akin to cherries, sloes, and blueberries soaked in alcohol. The peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate, but is never too dominant. An oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish. Great balance and integration; a finish that genuinely works. £53",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
89,"Douglas of Drumlanrig (distilled at Caol Ila), Cask #6616",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Soft and gentle (for Caol Ila, that is), thanks to the 25 years of aging. Plenty of creamy vanilla and honey to go with the malty foundation, along with coal tar, licorice root, and olive, with a hint of brine, juniper, unsweetened dark chocolate, and tobacco (cigars in a humidor?). Very nice. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",John Hansell,Summer 2011
89,Glen Garioch 1991,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled at Glen Garioch when peated barley was still being used, this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose, considering its strength. Subtle malt and fudge notes, plus a hint of wood smoke. Fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate, with a suggestion of treacle. Developing spicy smokiness. Fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. The ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish, with advancing, discreet oak. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.) ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
89,The Naked Grouse,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"This is the latest spinoff from core blend The Famous Grouse, so there’s Macallan and Highland Park in here, and from the taste of it, in sizeable quantities. With smart but minimalist packaging and an environmental theme, this is a very ‘now’ whisky. It’s heavily sherried, very rich, and sweet, but there’s enough spice to stop it becoming cloying, and it’s as soft as a down feather blanket on the palate. You can easily drink it straight, too.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
89,Evan Williams Single Barrel 2001 Vintage (Barrel #1),,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"While last year’s vintage was a more delicate expression of Evan Williams, I loved it for its elegance, charm, and balance (and gave it a 95 rating). This one is darker in flavor and bolder, with more caramelized sugars (caramel, toffee, maple syrup) along with some underlying fruit. It’s also drier, spicier, and with more wood influence (resin and polished leather). It still maintains its balance on the nose and majority of the palate, but with more wood on the finish than I would prefer to rate it in the 90s. (One more thing to consider: it’s a single barrel bottling and no two barrels are alike.) <em>Value Pick</em>",John Hansell,Spring 2011
89,Signatory (distilled at Aberlour) 20 year old 1990 vintage Cask No. 101777,,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Matured in a bourbon hogshead. Floral nose. Soft, creamy, and elegant, with honeyed malt, custard, subtle butterscotch, and delicate fruit (orange, peach) peppered with spice (powdered vanilla, nutmeg). Well-balanced, gently dry, and easy drinking. A charming whisky (for a lazy Sunday afternoon, perhaps?)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
89,Bunnahabhain 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,53,"The new version, at a higher proof and not chill-filtered. That helped — especially on the palate — with greater texture and more well-defined flavors. But the flavors are essentially the same: nutty, toffee, light molasses, vanilla fudge, with delicate fruit (citrus, dark berries) and a hint of brine. Very comforting. Extra points for versatility — this whisky will accommodate many moods and situations.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
89,Glenkinchie 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,189,"If Cragganmore is sometimes overlooked, then what of this poor Lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? Again, here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks, but whereas Cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute, this is expressive and lively. The nose, with intense floral notes of lilac blossom, freesia, and chamomile, is a revelation. These are backed with a thick, unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. Give it time, and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note, like a just-whittled stick. A hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. The mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or Vin Jaune. I like its energy, and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy, so for drinking purposes I’d have a glass of ice cold water on the side. All in all impressive, with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark.",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
89,Amrut Intermediate Sherry,,Indian Whisky,,"Aged in bourbon casks, then sherry casks, then finished in bourbon casks. An interesting (and original?) approach, but is it worth all the effort? I think so. The sherry notes are clean, not cloying, and there’s plenty of oak resin on the palate for texture, and to balance the sherry’s sweetness. Liqueur-ish fruit (orange, raspberry, cherry, caramelized peach), along with a good peppering of dried spice (vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, anise). Distinctive resin on the finish props up the rest of the flavors. ",John Hansell,Spring 2011
89,Auchroisk 20 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Poor old Auchroisk. Not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “Oth Rusk,” in case you’re interested), but in recent years it’s seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — Glendullan, Dufftown, Glen Ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 

Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here’s the difference; there’s sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words, there’s plenty of distillery character, but good cask development. 

In the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water, however (not too much), and there’s a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well. Be careful with the water though, as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
90,Knappogue Castle 12 year old Château Pichon Baron French Oak Cask-Finished,46.0,Irish Single Malt,80,"Clean and fresh aromas of raspberry jam and vanilla cream spread thickly on warm scones, speckled with fragrant spices of pepper and grated nutmeg. An instant spicy kick is followed by a flood of warm fruitiness in the mouth, then baked goods and dried citrus. Pepperiness spreads across the tongue, growing dominant over flavors of runny caramel and dried fruits. The finish is slightly drying, spicy, and peppery, with good length. (1,020 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Compass Box No Name (No. 2),,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"So good, they didn’t name it twice. More brooding than the first iteration, with a heavy curtain of ashy sooty smoke, fresh herbal tones, lemon, and dried fruity sweetness. The palate is led by red cherry, plum, cranberry, and tangy orange peel, then hot smoke sets off a peppery firecracker. The structure is deceptively light, developing more grip as the lemon sherbet sweetness heralds the lengthy finish of beach bonfire smoke. (8,436 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Jefferson’s Groth Reserve Cask-Finished Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The nose has notes of cherry candy, pink pastilles, and a bowl of raspberries and blueberries, as well as brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, and toffee. The palate begins with overtones of toasted nuttiness, fruit notes of sweet peach, apricot, and cherry, all underpinned by vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and white pepper. The finish melds pepper spice, chocolate, roasted pecans, and blackberry. Light on its feet, balancing against the oak.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
90,Bunnahabhain 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,65,"The nose is fresh, with sea salt, tangerines, and light smokiness. Vanilla, sultanas, malt, a hint of sherry, hazelnuts, and woodsmoke are present on the oily palate. Lingering in the finish, with salt and drying smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
90,Bunnahabhain 1988 Vintage Marsala Cask-Finished,,Single Malt Scotch,625,"Spicy sultanas, greengage plums, toffee, and new leather on the nose. Damsons, prunes, black pepper, mint, and old oak on the palate. The finish is musky, slightly smoky, with fruit spices, dark chocolate, licorice, and tannic oak. An intriguing take on Bunnahabhain. (1,260 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
90,GlenDronach Port Wood,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Port Wood is a limited-edition 10 year old expression, matured in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks, followed by a port pipe finish. Gingerbread, figs, dried apricot, and honey on the nose. Viscous, with sweet orange notes on the palate, milk chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. Hazelnuts, cherry pie, and sultanas in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
90,Tamdhu 15 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,115,"Molasses, orange peel, and prickly oak spices on the nose; herbal, oily green notes develop. Finally, more overt sherry. The palate is supple, with sweet sherry and icing sugar notes, plus Turkish Delight, fruitcake, and toffee. Ultimately, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Cloves, more dark chocolate, and mouth-drying oak in the long finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
90,Stranahan’s Sherry Cask Single Malt (Batch 004),47.0,Single Malt American Whiskey,80,"Finished in 500-liter oloroso sherry casks, this is one for the sherry lovers, with sugared almond, fig, milk chocolate, and candied fruit notes on the nose. The palate is rich, with milk chocolate Toblerone, grape soda, raspberry coulis, candied ginger, almonds, Fig Newtons, and drying oak. It finishes sweet and silky, with a hint of tobacco, vanilla, and delicate dried fruit.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
90,Powers Gold Label,,Blended Irish Whiskey,38,"Ground cinnamon, coriander seed, nutmeg, mustard seed, spiced meat, and the saltiness of sand-encrusted seashells combine with a powerful honey note, fresh pear, golden sultana, and Cox’s apple. Quaker Oats, golden syrup, and chocolate-covered graham crackers with cherries set the scene, though spices quickly engulf them. Perfect harmony is reestablished as it fattens out with cinnamon toffee. Bold, robust, and triumphant: just add a Dublin pub weekend crowd and you’re all set.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Kavalan 10th Anniversary Bordeaux Pauillac Wine Cask-Matured Single Malt,,Taiwanese Whisky,283,"Enticing aromas of clove, cranberry, cooking apple, hawthorn, allspice, tobacco, and graphite sticks. It is a spicy mouthful at full strength, with clove and pepper dominating the citrus fruit, berries, and orchard fruit. Dilution is recommended, where flavors of baked apple, cinnamon, and raspberry emerge. NT$8,800",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Reservoir Maison de Cuivre Wine Cask-Finished Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,135,"The nose is fragrant, with aromas of spice cabinet, charred oak, burnt nuts, clove, dark chocolate, and black pepper. The palate is big, spicy, and chewy, with bitter charred oak, dark chocolate, coffee beans, toasted almonds, cracked pepper, and bitter lemon. Water reveals roasted peanut shells, campfire, and more chocolate. The finish is long and flavorful, with back notes of spiced oak, espresso, and sweet chocolate. Rich, mouth-filling, and satisfying.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
90,"Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1948 (distilled at Glen Grant, Cask 2154)",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Smoky sherry, damp burlap, lanolin, then orange blossom on the nose, with a hint of glass cleaner. The palate yields juicy damsons, followed by aniseed, bitter chocolate, and oak tannins. Char and faint smoke in the extremely long finish. (50 bottles in U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
90,Berry Bros. & Rudd 21 year old Perspective Series,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,110,"The youngest in an excellent new range that combines small-batch blending by Doug McIvor with dramatic monochrome Scottish landscape photography by Lindsay Robertson, each image a visual metaphor for the whisky. Toffee, cherry, rich fruit, walnut, marmalade, vanilla essence, ripe banana, seasoned oak, and aromatic whole spices. The palate is charming and indulgent with rich fruitcake, banoffee pie, a good dose of spice, and a silky finish. £89

90,J.P. Wiser’s 23 year old Cask Strength Blended,,Canadian,113,"This long-aged blend of all-rye and all-corn whiskies celebrates J.P. Wiser’s belief that great whisky can’t be rushed. A dry nose with rye spices and overripe pears is quite complex. The palate, sweet and somewhat drying, suddenly shows strong ripe cherry notes, then pipe tobacco, cigar box, lingering heat, medium weight, gorgeous woody notes, and strong peppery spices. Hints of rye spices punctuate a long, hot, and fruity finish. 150 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
90,Teerenpeli Portti Single Malt,43.0,World Whisky,125,"This impressive whisky lets the port lead the dance, but never treads on the toes of its partner. The nose reveals prominent cask influences of pomegranate, inky plum flesh, blackberry, and gummy cherries, with a supporting cast of honeycomb, dried herbs, and bay leaf. It jinks and dodges between dried peel, fudge, baked orange, vanilla, and fine spice notes before developing into a sweet ripe cherry and red apple finale.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Barr An Uisce 16 year old 1803,46.0,Irish Single Malt,120,"Vanilla buttercream, honey, sweet oak, granola, and toasted spice with a pinch of pepper demonstrate the beauty of bourbon-cask maturation for Irish single malt. This is sweet, silky, and carefree, with citrus, honey, oat cereal, and black pepper. The spices grip the tongue, yielding to flavors of crystallized pineapple and grapefruit in the latter stages. Lemon, orange, and spices on a long, satisfying finish. Straight-forward, darn good whiskey. (1,803 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Kentucky Peerless Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"An herbal nose of thyme, dill, and licorice underpinning notes of blueberry jam, cherries, chocolate, honey-roasted nuts, and old leather. The palate is full and creamy, with milk chocolate, cinnamon, blackberry, toasted almond, dried herbs, and oak. Water brings out more chocolate and spicy heat. A long finish of oak, almond, chocolate, and cracked pepper, with a tobacco overlay. A big, robust bourbon with plenty to like.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
90,Doc Swinson’s Cabernet Sauvignon Cask-Finished Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"A profusion of nutty aromas: freshly shelled peanuts, boiled peanuts, and buttered pecan lead the way, with candied cherries and molasses on toast emerging on the palate. There are also heaps of dusty, drying oak throughout, helping to balance the oily texture. Finishes with chocolate-covered cherries, blueberry pie, more peanut, and drying wood tannins.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
90,Widow Jane 10 year old Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 137),,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Floral on the nose, with notes of orange blossom, as well as cinnamon, caramel, coffee cake, and cola. The palate is smooth and balanced, featuring pound cake, chocolate frosting, pepper, Almond Joy, and lemon iced tea. The finish has excellent length, and reprises the tropical notes. Water brings out vanilla custard and cinnamon. Light, complex, and balanced, with great integration of flavors; perfect for the warmer months.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
90,Wolves First Run (Batch 1),53.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),150,"A blend of three whiskeys: one distilled from stout, one from pilsner, and one a rye. The nose has citrusy notes of lime, followed by vanilla, dried apple, and pine. The palate offers more pine, dried red fruits, oak char, and white pepper. Water releases blueberry, vanilla, bitter espresso, and pecan. Orange peel and pineapple on the finish, with dark chocolate, dried figs, and pine smoke. Balance, depth, and restraint. (898 bottles)",David Fleming,Fall 2019
90,Matsui Mizunara Cask,48.0,Japanese,90,"Very pale, fresh whisky, with lychee, fresh pear, morning dew, apple notes, and just a dash of salt and white pepper. It’s a honeyed and thick dram on the palate, with caramelized apples and tangerine, then late bittersweet citrus that attempts to dampen down the jackhammer of pepper. Enjoyable weight, texture, and flavors, but the mizunara signature notes are a little subtle and underplayed. (3,972 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Jameson Caskmates Great Divide Brewing Co. Edition,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"The association with this Denver brewery has produced a whisky redolent of crabapple, tinned peach, leather bootstraps, vanilla pod, roasted malt, and spices left to blacken in the pan. This is a scrumptious whisky layered with mixed citrus, honey, shortbread, and lashings of vanilla creaminess. The clove, ground ginger, and black pepper lay down a solid foundation, superimposed with oak char and black coffee grounds in the latter stages.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Dewar’s 27 year old Double Double,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"The palo cortado finish is restrained, with notes of pale sherry, crisp green apple, honeycomb, cocoa, cooked plum, tangy citrus, and tobacco smoke, yet the palate has a generous, mouth-drawing fruitiness. Lemon meringue pie, tangerine zest, lime, and pineapple form the whisky’s substance, which is augmented by a time-delayed progression through caramel, ground almond, espresso, and chocolate brownie. Smoke hangs like a specter at the feast.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Octomore Dialogos 10 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,235,"Distilled from malt peated to 167 ppm, this whisky’s complex maturation program includes first-fill port and cognac, second-fill American whiskey, and virgin oak casks. The nose is sweet, with ginger, marzipan, rock pools, and floral smokiness. Initially, barley sugar and malt on the palate, then drier, with a hint of iodine, medicated soap, old leather, and dried peat. Peppery, with antiseptic and smoky oak in the finish. (12,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
90,Glenrothes Whisky Maker’s Cut,,Single Malt Scotch,75,"The nose offers rich fruit—plums and sultanas—with milk chocolate and new leather.

With water, fragrant apple, clementine, coconut, bubble gum, and cotton candy notes emerge. The palate is also candied, with cherry, raspberry pastilles, grape jelly, milk chocolate, and cracked pepper. On the finish, it’s chocolate cream pie, almond, and a halo of tobacco leaf. A veritable chocolate factory, balanced against a tart espresso note and tobacco.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
90,West Cork Export Stout Cask Finish,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,30,"The trend for finishing Irish whiskey in beer barrels now connects Skibbereen and Castle Island Brewing Co. in Massachusetts, creating this breezy dram with aromas of lemon curd, shortbread, vanilla frosting, and dry spices, with plenty of coastal character. Melon, blossom honey, and peach on the palate, before a real creaminess develops, smudged by gentle spices. The later phase has toffee oozing from lemon bonbons, vanilla cake mix, and more fruity richness. (3,900 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Teerenpeli Kaski,43.0,Single Malt Finnish Whisky,125,"The nose is lavish, with dried orange peel, raisins, plum, gingersnaps, aniseed, and menthol. It’s a thick, malty, statement whisky, rich with raisin, prune juice, heather honey, fig, and walnut, and laced with aniseed and clove. Pleasantly reminiscent of childhood cough medicine, there are long, sweet, syrupy prune notes at the end. It feels like it must be doing you some good. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Dublin Liberties Keeper’s Coin 16 year old,46.0,Irish Single Malt,379,"Mandarin segments, ripening lime, brown sugar breakfast pastries, cardamom, star anise, marzipan, and seasoned oak on this triple-distilled Irish single malt. It’s fruity, sweet, full-bodied, and wonderfully rich thanks to the Pedro Ximénez finish. It glides from tangy orange to marmalade, with fruit-flavored hard candy, clove, and allspice. They’ve got this bang on. The spices shut down quickly on the finish, leaving baked peel flavors. €340",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Tommyrotter Cider Cask Finished Tennessee Straight Whiskey,,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Hugely herbal from the start: coriander seed, licorice, dill, and black tea aromas, with some grape and blueberry jam, lemon, and oak. Sweet fruit tempers the herbaceous and mineral palate; layers of cooked berry, Coca-Cola, cherries, lemon oil, and peanuts create a silky, rounded profile, all tied up with generous oak. Finished in Black Bird Cider Works hard cider casks.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
90,Driftless Glen Bourbon,48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,46,"Orange, lemon peel, iced tea, cinnamon, and blueberry jam aromas are undercut by earthy notes of mulch, chili powder, cracked corn, and dill. Oak leads the flavor parade, but is well-tempered by raspberry, pomegranate, cinnamon, orange, licorice, walnuts, and black pepper. Chocolate, more pomegranate, chili powder, and silky oak round out this lush bourbon, which shows impressive maturity for its 2 years.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
90,Murray McDavid 2003 Òrdha Meas 13 year old,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,55,"An incredible surround-sound sensation of heavy peat smoke, with toffee, blackened spices, salted caramel, and warm leather. The journey is impressive, from the sweet toffee torn asunder by huge gusts of pepper, the tangy strands of citrus and banoffee pie with baked banana, the apples baked in brown sugar, before a final return to the smoke. A sweet and spicy finish, though the flavors recede fairly rapidly.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Peg Leg Porker 8 year old Tennessee Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Nashville barbecue icon Carey Bringle filters this whiskey through hickory charcoal, bottling it under the name of his restaurant. A candied nose of saltwater taffy and bubble gum, followed by peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla cake, banana, cracked pepper, and spicy oak. The palate offers almond, chocolate, coconut, tobacco, brown sugar, and blueberry pie. Water brings out rich milk chocolate, strawberry jam, and cherry cobbler. The finish is smooth and flavorful, with more chocolate, nuttiness, coconut, tobacco, and oak.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
90,Old Line Cask Strength American Single Malt (Batch 1M),60.0,Single Malt American Whiskey,70,"Sweet and lightly smoky on the nose: toasted marshmallow, campfire logs, Sugar Babies, dried orange rind, Nilla Wafer, smoked almonds, and rich hot chocolate. Without water, the proof shows itself, but add a few drops and what was a dry brush fire is now smoked chili-chocolate, cinnamon, black pepper, orange oil, almonds, and a little bacon. Ashy and sweet on the finish, with chili heat, orange, nuts, and chocolate. Potentially divisive in its profile, but its powerful character is undeniable.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
90,Eifel German Rye,46.0,World Whisky,55,"A dark amber dram made from 90% rye yields a nose of chestnuts, mushroom consommé, earthiness, nutmeg, and clove. Dark berries dominate, with bramble, crème de cassis, black cherry, plum, and mixed peel, then chocolate, cinnamon, and nutmeg—a great autumnal dram after an invigorating walk in the countryside. Unique and confident whisky with an inky blue-fruit finish matched with dry and gentle spiciness. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak Cask Strength,53.0,Japanese,89,"Fully matured in mizunara oak on land and sea, this has tangy orange, ground ginger, fennel seed, cedar, and incense, though it seems a little more tightly wound than the standard strength whisky. Juicy orange, quick firecracker spices, and more toffee sweetness; it becomes heavy and thick, flaunting high alcohol, then turns creamier with marzipan, orange Jell-O, and singed oak spices.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak The Peated (2nd Edition),46.0,Japanese,89,"This is utterly unique; made from imported Scottish peated malt, it spends 2 years in madeira casks, then 6 years in mizunara casks. Light, clean, fruity refreshment: apple, white grape, lingering cigar smoke, coconut macaroons, and ample Japanese oak influence. Apple and watermelon flavors, developing a more sugary fruitiness of Life Savers hard candy, all brushed with gentle spice and a swish of smoke.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Compass Box Juveniles,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"A blend of four single malts for the latest incarnation, this has poached pear, sweet green apple, melon skins, light spices, barley sugar, and yet some crunchy barley notes too. Sweet vanilla fattens out to orange, peppercorn, honey, and barley sugar, with apple and herbal greenery appearing at the end.

90,Johnnie Walker Sweet Peat,,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"Created by blender George Harper, who worked on White Walker, this has nutty toffee, coffee grounds, caramelized sugars, roasted hazelnut in chocolate, an appreciable grain note, plus the titular gentle sweet peat smoke. Toasted oak, chocolate praline, sweet runny caramel, coffee, and a catch of smoke dissipate to leave the smooth flavor of creamy toffee penny candy. An uncut diamond with great potential set against the brilliance of Black Label. £30",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019

90,Balvenie 1999 vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 18 year old single malt is stylistically very different from the older releases in Chapter 4. The nose is soft, with honey and mashed banana.

The flavor is more refined with greater complexity; not overly sweet or fruity, but a smooth-as-satin mouthfeel with shades of pear, caramel covered in white chocolate, nuts, pleasant pot still spiciness, rich toffee, cocoa, and red chili.

90,Dillon’s Three Oaks,43.0,Canadian,50,"Hail the new distillers who have so broadened the profile of rye whisky. All rye grain, some matured in new American and Canadian oak and some in bourbon barrels, yields a complex palate woven into sweet citrus reminiscent of Grand Marnier.

90,The Irishman Single Malt Small Batch 2018,40.0,Irish Single Malt,50,"This noses of crumbly shortbread, vanilla, caramel, orange peels, summer blooms, walnut, and earthy whole spices, but it’s more reserved than their 12 year old. It glides through orange, spun sugar, almond paste, a slow burn of spices, butterscotch, and vanilla, before more sherry fruit comes through. Peppercorn and dark berry mark the finish of this graceful, mellow, and subdued limited-release, triple-distilled whiskey.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,Old Pepper Straight Rye (Barrel G18Q),,Rye Whiskey,80,"A characterful, if peculiar whiskey that suggests younger rye. Horehound, citronella oil, scented geranium, and lemon balm contribute to an intensely herbal, slightly antiseptic aroma. There is a compelling bitter edge to the flavor, like biting into orange peel, while the finish is intensely woody and mouth-coating. Not for everyone, but quite captivating and flavorful.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019

90,Navazos Palazzi Overseas Malt Single Sherry Cask,,Spanish Whisky,104,"Although distilled in Scotland, this completed its maturation in Spain; it’s not scotch, but it is very tasty. Cocoa powder, melted milk chocolate, ground hazelnut, vanilla pod, snuff, and allspice go full tilt at cask strength.

Wonderfully balanced, even as blackberries remain strong across the palate, accented by tart kiwi fruit and rich spices: ginger, cloves, nutmeg. Fruits and spices complement each other as the round, creamy palate fades into a long, hot, peppery finish.

90,Octomore Edition 09.3 Dialogos,,Single Malt Scotch,230,"Distilled from 52 tons of Islay barley and filled into 134 casks, most of which were second fill.

90,Parker’s Heritage Collection 2018 Orange Curaçao Finished,55.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"This is sure to be a divisive edition, but once you open your mind to the idea, it’s hard to argue with the titillating aromas and seductive sweetness that curaçao casks bring.

90,Westland Garryana (Batch 3|1),56.0,Craft Whiskey,150,"The third release of Westland’s single malt aged in native Garryana oak from the Northwest.

Those same fruits tumble over each other on the palate, which is light but complex, with gentle spice, cigar wrapper, dark chocolate, and slightly drying oak.

90,BenRiach Temporis 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,265,"Temporis is a peated variant of BenRiach, and like its unpeated 21 year old stablemate it was matured in a mix of four types of barrels: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez, and oloroso sherry. Sweet leather and peat on the nose; emerging vanilla and woodsmoke. Quite muscular on the palate, where orchard fruits are balanced by drying oak. White pepper and aniseed in the relatively long finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
90,GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 7,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Like previous releases in the Cask Strength series, this was matured in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The nose offers honey, soft sherry, eucalyptus, and cherry blossom. Supple and sugary on the very approachable palate, with nutty toffee, dark sherry, and dark chocolate-coated cherry liqueurs. Long and spicy, with ripe plums in the finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
90,Macallan Edition No. 4,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Seven types of European and American oak casks were used for maturation. Lively on the nose, with orange, malt, sherry, and sweet oak. Initially, a touch hot on the palate, with sherry and cloves, then toffee and vanilla, red apples, figs, and cocoa. The finish is medium to long, with spicy sherry.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
90,The Tyrconnell Original,43.0,Irish Single Malt,45,"Repackaged at a higher strength, the nose is grassy, with lemon zest, hints of apple and pear, vanilla seeds, almonds, and fresh florals. Light honey and summer fruits, barley notes, and vanilla, becoming juicier over time with base notes of whole spice, before serving up a lemon-and-honey lozenge finish. Very assured, this double-distilled single malt is a must for your Irish whiskey shelf. <em>Best Value</em>",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
90,Amrut Peated,46.0,Indian Whisky,80,"Smoked meat, paprika, cumin, peppercorn, and star anise, amid fragrant smoke and maple bacon. The flavors are supremely fruity with tangerine, marmalade, lime zest, and pineapple juice. Among the fruit is a cascade of aromatic spices, before the interjection of a most compelling sour fruit note, and the smokiness takes charge. It’s certainly no Islay mimic, this terrific Indian whisky demonstrates it has the courage of its own convictions.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
90,Port Askaig 14 year old Bourbon Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This limited edition was distilled in 2004 and aged in eleven first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm lemon juice, rock pools, new tweed, and new leather, plus peat smoke and charcuterie on the nose. The palate is robust, sweet, and fruity, with spicy orange, vanilla, caramel, and earthy peat. Long in the finish, with light tannins and peat coated with stewed fruits. (420 bottles for U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
90,Colkegan Cask Strength Single Malt,59.0,Craft Whiskey,75,"Mesquite-smoked New Mexico single malt. Rich and beefy on the nose: charred brisket, salted meat, tangerines, dark wood, brine, and white smoke. The palate is powerful, oak-forward without being astringent, and very spicy. Walnut, cayenne pepper, and grilled citrus balance out the meaty, oaky flavors. Saddle leather, cherries, and even more smoke on the finish. Tangy, salty, spicy, and malty. A truly compelling American single malt with great structure.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
90,Oppidan Smoke + Sea Bourbon,46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"Sweet smoke mingles with lemon curd, milk chocolate, roasted marshmallow, and vanilla-frosted yellow cupcake on the nose. The palate has a rubbery peatiness, yet the flavor remains fresh, with cherries and grapes, roasted nuts, salted caramel, and milk chocolate. It all wraps up with the ashiness of pipe tobacco and lengthy saline minerality. Beguiling and moreish—a whiskey worth lingering over. (3,000 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
90,Virginia Distillery Co. Cider Cask Finished Virginia-Highland (Batch 2),46.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Malty and biscuity aromas mingle seamlessly with vanilla, plums, raisins, and chocolate-covered bananas. The Highland scotch in the blend asserts itself with dry graininess and a floral character bordering on potpourri, but is well-balanced with cooked plum and pear, chocolate, ginger, and Fig Newton. Nuttiness and a bit of ash round out a pleasantly bitter-sweet finish that shows impressive length.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
90,Larceny,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Lots of dried fruit, figs, and caramel lead off this bold but balanced bourbon, as dark berry fruits smack of sweet crème de cassis on the palate. There’s a good bit of spice here, like hot and spicy peanuts, that meets the sweet fruit and vanilla. Shows great length and nice polish on the finish with its dusty oak and cocoa.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
90,Mossburn Signature Casks Series Speyside Blended Malt,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,40,"This is clever. Using Mossburn Cask Bill #2, the whisky has been finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts with heavily toasted virgin American oak heads. The nose is intense: sweet barley, fresh oak, vanilla, pear, fresh apple, orange peel, and dry wood spices. Silky texture, with citrus, barley, coriander seed, pepper, aniseed, and clove, offering further waves of creamy vanilla, fruit Life Savers, and soft malty notes.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
90,Heaven’s Door Double Barrel,50.0,American Whiskey (Unspecified),50,"The additional year of aging in new American oak is readily apparent in this blend of American whiskeys. Dry, toasty, charred oak takes the lead before cherry cough drop, cedar, clove, eucalyptus, and toasted nuts emerge. The red and blue fruits are met with a jolt of spice that will delight rye whiskey fans, before delivering earthy, leathery, tobacco leaf on the finish. Big in oak flavors, but not overdone.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
90,Rossville Union Barrel Proof Rye,,Rye Whiskey,70,"The aroma is a mélange of sweet goodness, with violet candies, figgy dried fruits, and molasses cake that almost evoke a cane-like rum sweetness, as tobacco leaf, leather, and sassafras notes add depth. It’s a real roof burner on the palate, broad and mouth coating, offering a big blast of spices, cocoa powder, tropical fruits, and vanilla before the wood and minty herbs drive it to the finish line.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
90,Rossville Union Straight Rye,47.0,Rye Whiskey,40,"The nose smells wonderfully chewy, with buttery toffee, candied nuts, charred oak, cracked pepper, and a hint of fresh dill. The palate sings with electric spice and rolls along nicely with stone fruit, peppercorn, sweet vanilla, and leathery oak, each taking their turn before the slightly hot finish of oak tannins. A blend of 51% and 95% rye mashbills from Indiana’s MGP.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
90,G. Rozelieures Peaty Collection,46.0,French Whisky,70,"A little savory at first, with burning leaves and green wood, aromatic spice mix, pastrami, malt loaf, and Worcestershire sauce. Certainly complex and distinctive from a sensory perspective. Initially there is light vanilla sponge, citrus, and brown sugar, but the vanilla grows stronger, combines with malt, and meets an angry surge of pepper. The pepper kicks back to peat smoke and then all is right with the world.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
90,Compass Box Oak Cross,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,59,"Compared to Asyla, this has noticeable added richness, fruit, and spice. The nose brings apple danish, creamy custard, honey, citrus peel, and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich, tangy fruits, a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue, stealthily curls around the sides, and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,1792 Small Batch,,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Initially it’s a nut-filled experience with toasted walnuts, pecans, and Brazil nuts, but an atypical spice appears that’s just lovely. Smoked hatch chiles mingle with rounded notes of cinnamon, créme brûlée, Bananas Foster, orange, canned peaches, caramel chew, and toffee. The pepper spices reappear for a grand finish.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
90,BenRiach 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,300,"Matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks. Honey, vanilla, and tropical fruits on the spicy, aromatic nose, with just a hint of oak. The honey and vanilla carry over to the palate, where they are joined by peaches, drinking chocolate, and subtle sherry. The finish dries steadily, with long-lasting citrus fruit. A stylish, complex dram.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
90,The Macallan Edition No. 3,,Single Malt Scotch,95,"The third release in Macallan’s annual Edition series—which focuses on aspects of cask influence—was matured in a mix of European and American oak casks. Figs and apricot jam, vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is silky and offers a big citrus fruit hit, Bit-O-Honey, then creamy milk chocolate. Milk chocolate persists through the long, fruity finish, with attendant sweet oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
90,Kavalan Concertmaster,40.0,Taiwanese Whisky,99,"An effusive offering of dark fruits: cranberry, blueberry, and black currant. This is a beautiful marriage of the spirit and the port cask finishing, showing applesauce, aged oak, macaroons, and dry aromatic spices. Black currant holds sway on the tongue, yielding to caramel, ground ginger, a second burst of juicy blueberry, with a hot finish evoking strips of dried tropical fruit and flashes of ground pepper. Rewarding and flavorsome.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Bushmills 10 year old,40.0,Irish Single Malt,44,"This is just a delight; a real flavor giver. A wave of honey sweeps along aromas of creamy vanilla, white peach, fresh citrus peel, white pepper, cinnamon stick, and milk chocolate. It starts delicately with melon, light grape, and vanilla, swells with citrus acidity and creamy caramel, ramping up to toffee, darker fruits, chocolate, Fruit Pastilles, and a little oak. The finish is mouth-clinging, with vanilla and spice.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90, That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,200,"Ovaltine, Whoppers, worn leather, antique furniture, medjool dates, and black fruits on the nose. Sipping this whisky is an unexpected delight. Given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity, it’s surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. A charming opening of crumble filling with red currant, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry, joined by apple, pear, and sultana, with peppery spice. Chili heat and spicy finish. (Batch 6; 2,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,The English Single Cask Rum Cask (No. 0471),,World Whisky,156,"A heavily peated whisky finished in a single rum cask. Very smoky with a lot of heat, but a balanced depth. Quite meaty on the palate. Heather honey, supple leather, English peppercorn sauce, and salted vanilla wafers, with incense hanging in the air. Charred apple skins and red berry fruit keep this from being out of balance. Boysenberry, lavender, and smoke on the finish. Very forceful, but complex and intriguing. If beefeaters didn’t already have a drink, they’d probably drink this. (<em>360 bottles; U.S. only</em>)",Adam Polonski,Summer 2018
90,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 015),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"It opens with a crust of salt and Flintstones vitamins in honey, almond paste, and caramel. Then pumice, pear, canned peaches, and baked apples jump into the mix, followed by Nutella, Cheerios, candied pecans, and chocolate. As the medium to long finish sets in, slight hints of smoke appear and suggest it would pair great with a bold cigar. A drop of water only makes it better.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
90,Barrell Infinite Barrel Project (Feb. 12,,Miscellaneous,65,"With smoke and oak, this starts off so intense with pepper spices, peat, dried apricot, hard candies, caramel-covered apples, salted butter, pecan shell, and strawberry jam. Leather, tobacco, and baking spices begin the descent toward a medium, slightly bitter finish. If you like trying new things, this is an American cadre of flavors unlike anything out there. (Bottled on February 12, 2018)",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
90,The Whistler 10 year old How the Years Whistle By,46.0,Irish Single Malt,55,"The Cooney family opened the Boann Distillery in Ireland’s Boyne Valley in 2016. A little maturity and oloroso finishing fills this whiskey with a more sophisticated air, bringing red fruits, pecan cookies, orange, apple, pear, and some dry, peppery spices. The palate has good weight and a lovely balance; caramel sweetness, orange, crystalized pineapple, butterscotch, and pepper, with a hint of bitter lemon on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Kikori,41.0,Japanese,50,"Get back to nature; this is a whisky to savor during a spectacular sunrise. Lychee, edamame, pea shoots, green apple, and morning dew on lush lawns. As it warms and wakes up, there are hints of orange and some piquant spice. The taste jumps from lemongrass to lemon candies, with melon, mild peppercorn, gentle vanilla, creamy oak, and a few green notes at the end.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Dingle Single Malt,,Irish Single Malt,77,"Despite some inconsistent spelling of sherry terms on the exterior tube, Dingle is releasing some very good initial whiskeys. The nose brings dates, dried apricot and apple, haystacks, vanilla, unwaxed lemon, and cardamom pod. This second small batch release tastes fruity, with orange lollipops, a beautifully developed apricot note, and caramel, leading to a peak of gingerbread and pepper, followed by vanilla, toffee, and orange oil twisted from the peel. (6,000 bottles) €65",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Doc 52 Straight Bourbon Whiskey,55.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"On the nose, cherry tart baked over a fireplace: rich red fruit with a whiff of soot and some chalky minerality. A lot of warmth on the palate, with biscotti, almond, toffee, and warm caramel apple topped with sweet vanilla cream, and chocolate ganache on the side. Good, creamy texture, with some sharp peppery tinges. A 9 year old Tennessee bourbon selected by and bottled for Doc’s Wine, Spirits and More in Memphis, Tennessee. (<em>152 bottles</em>)",Adam Polonski,Summer 2018
90,Crown Royal Blender’s Select,45.0,Canadian,42,"Crown Royal develops its bourbon-like house style by using an American-style mashbill of 64% corn, 31.5% rye, and 4.5% malted barley for one of its many component whiskies. From this single component, blender Mark Balkenende selected mature whisky exhibiting sweet flowers, pear juice, vanilla, fresh grain, mild barrel tones, clean dry wood, brisk spices, and a long, glowing finish. Very floral, fruity, and quaffable. ($55CAD; Ontario only)",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2018
90,Jameson Caskmates IPA Edition,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Hoppy notes cloaking the crisp grains, green apple, and pomelo make for a happier marriage than its stout sibling. This is one of those whiskeys that continuously evolves in the mouth, progressing from a sweet, syrupy beginning of coconut macaroons, apple, and spices, to a creamier plateau of citrus, stewed fruits, and chocolate. It departs leaving the tongue weighted down with peppery spice and cooked apple. Unexpectedly delicious. <em>Value pick</em>",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Dewar’s 15 year old The Monarch,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,50,"The divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot, honey, vanilla icing, malt bins, Quaker Oats Squares, and lofty floral top notes. Sweet mandarin, brown sugar, vanilla fudge, strands of finely shredded peel, and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. The sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Barrel Finish Rye 2017 Release,,Rye Whiskey,75,"At first, it’s truly American candy: melted chocolate-covered almonds and coconut. Then, it’s cinnamon, toffee, butterscotch, gingersnap cookies, red pepper, and Rice Krispies. This mouth-coating offers lingering baking spices throughout. A drop of water offers even more complexity, with pronounced caramel chew notes developing. With or without water, a complex and long finish awaits with hints of jalapeño chocolate.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
90,1792 Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,36,"Think carnival aromas—the good ones, anyway—meeting the campfire. Cracker Jacks, cinnamon-covered almonds, popcorn, cotton candy, marshmallows melting over graham crackers, and hints of smoldering oak. Next, coconut, caramel, and cocoa over a buttery mouthfeel with hints of toffee, banana, baked apple, and pumpkin pie appear. Toward the end, hints of black pepper and raspberry strudel surface in a medium to long finish.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
90,The Balvenie 1981 35 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A refill American oak hogshead matured this whisky. The nose offers malt, vanilla fudge, pineapple, and contrasting lemon.

90,BenRiach Authenticus 30 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,555,"Following on from 21 and 25 year old expressions of Authenticus, BenRiach has now added its oldest variant yet to the lineup. The nose offers orchard fruits, honey, polished oak, and vanilla-tinged peat smoke. Full and fruity on the palate, with sweet peat having a presence, plus milk chocolate and licorice. The finish is relatively long, with citrus fruit, ashy smoke, and a lingering herbal note. <em>£400; Not available in the U.S.</em>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,Bushmills Port Cask Reserve,40.0,Irish Single Malt,137,"Sweet honey daubed on ripe plums, an abundance of barley notes, black cherry, and a smattering of exotic spices. Juicy notes of cherry, plum, peach, and strawberry, with undertones of peppery spice. The flavor fills out with lovely malty notes, Quaker Oats, and vanilla. The port cask has really complemented the Bushmills character, and this second edition in the Steamship collection is the best in the series to date. (£99; Global Travel Retail only)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Exclusive Malts 2006 (distilled at Linkwood) 11 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The nose is pleasingly floral, with soft spice, malt, heather in bloom, and even a suggestion of violets. Well textured on the palate, oily and nutty, with tropical fruits, honey, milk chocolate, vanilla, and malt. The finish is lengthy, with a hint of citrus and warming spices. (Cask no. 69; 287 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,Gordon & MacPhail 1977 (distilled at Strathisla),,Single Malt Scotch,698,"This 40 year old was matured in a refill American hogshead. Perfumed on the nose, with vanilla, soft leather, lanolin, and lavender. Watery soft fruits on the palate, with cocoa powder and ginger. The finish offers more cocoa powder, black coffee, and licorice-flavored oak. £500 (191 bottles, <em>The Whisky Exchange exclusive</em>)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,West Cork Glengarriff Series Peat Charred Cask,43.0,Irish Single Malt,45,"An innovative approach to flavoring casks by charring the staves with burning peat, this whiskey develops a smoldering nose of dark chocolate brownies, dry wood smoke, and cocoa sweetness. The impact of the peat is confined to the nose, but it tastes pleasantly oily, with tangy citrus, Jolly Rancher hard candy, chocolate cake, spices, fizzy candies, and coffee notes. The finish of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and dried peel rounds off an extremely tasty whiskey. (4,800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Blade and Bow 22 year old 2017 Release,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"This is a re-release of the 2015 bottling. A tapestry of confectionery delights begins this journey, followed by fruit, cigar box, saddle leather, cotton candy, roasted pecans, caramel, and marshmallow. Then, it’s smoked paprika, fig, cinnamon, strawberry, and dark cherries. In the form of walnut shells, a powerful and somewhat pleasant bitterness finds the finish, with a hint of chocolate. But that bitterness does supersede the more pleasant notes, making it slightly unbalanced.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
90,Bruichladdich Octomore 08.3,,Single Malt Scotch,165,"One of four Octomore 08 Masterclass releases, this was distilled in 2011 from Islay barley peated to 309 ppm. Fifty-six percent of the spirit was matured in first-fill bourbon casks, while the remainder was aged in European oak wine casks. Barbecue smokiness on the nose, with wet peat and citrus fruitiness. On the palate, earthy peat, full-bodied red wine, and milk chocolate. Peat smoke to the fore in the finish, with ginger and chili. (18,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,Fuji-Sanroku Small Batch 18 year old,43.0,Japanese,207,"A little joy from Mount Fuji: soy sauce, five-spice powder, grilled pineapple, halved passion fruit, and the umami sensation of slightly salty umeboshi. It’s dense and mouth-coating, with maple syrup, cinnamon, and a steady build of rye spices, particularly nutmeg and clove, before closing off with dark baked orange. The spices are short lasting, but the pleasurably deep boiled orange candy sweetness persists for minutes. (JPY 22,000; Not available in the U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Lambay Single Malt,40.0,Irish Single Malt,70,"Spicier and darker than their blend, this delivers heather honey, banana peel, cashew, pepper, ground coriander, and bay leaf. Quite light-bodied and delicate to begin with, but the Cognac cask adds fruitiness and greater complexity. Sugary sweet, with tingly spices, honey, cracked black pepper, clove-studded oranges, and tangy marmalade. A finish of bitter orange, pepper, and fondant cream makes this a worthy addition to the Cognac cask revival.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Prizefight Irish Whiskey,43.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,45,"Inspired by the Morrissey-Sullivan bout of 1853, this whiskey received a 6 month rye barrel finish which results in enticing toasty notes, cinnamon bark, malt, and vanilla. The structure is light, the flavors are delicious, and it knocks you out with malt, creamy vanilla, active spices, and a dry nuttiness. Give the finish an eight-count for its long lasting spices and good punch of sweetness.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Reisetbauer 15 year old,48.0,Austrian Whisky,133,"Distilled by Hans Reisetbauer, this is like an amplified version of his 12 year old (see below). Red pears, pomegranate, walnut husks, and more active spices, from mace and asafetida to coriander. The flavors unfurl sedately over the palate like a flower coming into bloom: soft honeyed fruit, pear, raspberry, strawberry, spices, bramble, and chocolate drops. A drying finish of five-spice, dried apple, and chocolate. Best of this Austrian trio.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Yellow,45.0,World Whisky,50,"Blue iris, dried chilies, and fresh linen; the corn is sweet and fat, and the aromas integrate more harmoniously than the White and Black expressions. Fresh and fruity, orange marmalade, honey oozing into maple syrup, developing more complexity as the smooth layers shift to accommodate the growing pepper and chili heat ahead of a spicy honey finish. For a 10 month old single cask whiskey, this is remarkably impressive.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Crown Royal Noble Collection Wine Barrel Finished,,Canadian,60,"Until recently, Crown Royal, Canada’s best-selling whisky, took a conservative approach to limited-edition releases. The annual Noble Collection is a promising taste of the innovation underway at the Gimli, Manitoba distillery, which includes experiments with single grain wheat whisky, single malts, and more. This first venture into cask finishing uses Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. It is still Crown Royal, but on top of the bourbonesque vanillas and woody notes, rich red fruits jump from the glass. A new direction that moves Crown Royal into the realm of big, beautiful whiskies. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/18-crown-royal-noble-collection-wine-barrel-finished/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Number 18 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2017
90,Chivas Regal Ultis,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,160,"The first blended malt to carry the Chivas Regal name was created as a tribute to the legacy of the five master blenders, from Charles Howard in 1895 to Colin Scott. Malts from five of Pernod Ricard’s Speyside distilleries (Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval) were used to create intricate and elaborate flavors. Even more enchanting than the story are the aromas of fresh red apple, cherry, peach, and mango, mingled with cinnamon and dry heather. This luxurious whisky delivers dark vanilla, soft fruits, chocolate-dipped Brazil nuts, and is cloaked in sumptuous layers of caramel, wood spices, and gingersnaps. Outstanding. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/19-chivas-regal-ultis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Number 19 in the 2017 Top 20 </a></em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Benromach Triple Distilled 2009,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,59,"Benromach’s first triple-distilled single malt was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers peaches with a wisp of sweet smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lime. Voluptuous and very sweet on the palate; intense sugary orchard fruits and stem ginger, with the characteristic Benromach peat smoke dialed back. The finish embraces insistent black pepper, nutmeg, and very mild peat. £45",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,Blair Athol 23 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),,Single Malt Scotch,460,"This Perthshire single malt was distilled in 1993 and aged in European oak sherry butts. Brittle toffee, black treacle, aniseed, black pepper, and cigar boxes feature on the rich nose. The bold palate yields full, creamy sherry notes, almonds, ginger, old leather, and a slightly savory tang. Long, warming, and peppery in the finish. (5,514 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,Bunnahabhain 46 year old Eich Bhana Lìr,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Distilled in 1969, the oldest Bunnahabhain ever released was matured in second-fill sherry butts. The nose yields sweet resin, marzipan, ginger, glacé cherries, a hint of cloves, and red berries. The silky palate features Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, prunes, and more glacé cherries. The finish dries steadily, with slightly bitter tea, white pepper, a savory note, and quite subtle oak tannins for a dram of this vintage. (198 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,GlenDronach Kingsman Edition 1991,,Single Malt Scotch,900,"A nose of bold sherry, worn leather, figs, malt, white pepper, and ginger. Ultimately, a mildly savory note. Full-bodied on the palate, with overripe damsons and more ginger; spicy sherry and dried fruits develop. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent prickly spices, black coffee, and fragrant oak. (240 bottles for the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,Macallan 12 year old Double Cask,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Two oaks are better than one in this single malt, which marries whiskies matured in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak. The sherry imparts aromas of raisins, figs, hazelnuts, blanched almonds, candied orange peel, and leather. A backbone of vanilla sweetness on the palate supports layers of ginger and white pepper, dark chocolate, leather, raisins, toasted hazelnuts, and orange oil. This Macallan joins the core line between the Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges. Warming and rich without being syrupy, it doubles up on accessibility with its balance and remarkably affordable price for its quality and age. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/17-macallan-double-cask-12-year-old/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 17 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>

90,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2017 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"Initially, it’s extremely perfume-like, with floral notes often found in fragrances. Then the fruit completely takes over: banana, blueberry, plums, cherry, apple, pear, and quince. Of these, the banana lingers until chocolate and vanilla enter the picture, followed by hints of green pepper and graham cracker. Then, boom, baking spices launch into a lovely medium to long finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
90,Smooth Ambler Contradiction Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,55,"Generously oaked, with toasty oak drive delivering brown spices and earthy dried apple on the nose. The palate pours sweet and rich, with warm corn porridge underscored with dark molasses and maple flavors. There is a lot to like here, from the boiled peanuts to a spiced palate, as the young, house-made whiskey imparts its verve to the 9 year old Indiana bourbon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
90,Port Dundas 52 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),,Single Grain Whisky,900,"This 1964 distillate has a nose of rich toffee, weighty oak, allspice, antique hardback books, dried apple, cracker bread, and banana chips. A fairy tale taste of red apple perfection, as if Snow White polished it on her skirt. This ripens to encompass gumdrops and lollipops. Golden syrup, lime zest, caramel, and vanilla bleed into a conclusion of nutmeg, oak, and apple peel. An auspicious moment for grain whisky. (752 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Timorous Beastie 18 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,108,"Peach, meringue, whole apple, runny honey, vanilla, eucalyptus, and spices that are just about to burn in the pan. Lively and fresh Highland whisky flavor proffering sweet honey, cooked apple dusted with icing sugar, lime zest, and a supportive lift of vibrant spices before diffusing into sugary squares of Scottish tablet. Water accentuates the peppermint in the finish and brings out sugary chocolate-mint flavors. One not to miss.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Ohishi Islay Cask,,Japanese,100,"The legacy of the cask’s history imparts more smoke than peat. It hasn’t overpowered the spirit, but the whisky is light enough to be put in the shade, with singeing smoke, coal dust, vanilla, and asphalt. Sweet rice, vanilla, honey, and warm spices of ginger root and black peppercorn, before a late arrival of peat. Milk chocolate, burnt driftwood, toffee, and a little residual pepper on the finish. (636 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Fuji-Sanroku Signature Blend,50.0,Japanese,44,"Fuji-Gotemba Distillery’s talent for grain whisky is evident here, with a nose of waxy green leaves, whole peppercorn, and fleeting glimpses of lemon peel, lime zest, and white peach amid the airy, floral top notes. It has a serene, calming quality to it. Spicy pepper, orange peel, mouth-coating vanilla, creamy toffee, and crunchy apple, with a clean finish, like orange flesh laid out on

hot stones. JPY 5,000",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,J.J. Corry The Gael,46.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,75,"Chapel Gate whiskey aims to resurrect the lost art of the Irish whiskey bond. This delicious debut is built around parcels of aged single malt and grain sourced from County Louth. Fresh hay, floral blossoms, comb honey, dry spice, oak, a crate of whole lemons, and growing spices. Lemon sherbet, clean vanilla, and a peppery grunt resolve flavors of rich barley sugar and a hot pepper finish. (7,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Fukano 2017 Edition,,Japanese,80,"Supple nose of lychee, ripening peaches, candy hearts, watermelon, allspice, and white pepper. A light, slightly syrupy texture with an underbelly of watermelon and raspberry, this year’s release unwraps peach, nectarine, rhubarb, and custard candy, fruit Life Savers, stewed fruits, red berries, and light citrus. It’s surprising just how much flavor is packed into this rice whisky. Finish is dry—the watermelon is gone. (4,411 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Fukano 2017 Edition,,Japanese,80,"Japanese rice whiskies enjoy a cult following for their delicate flavors. This Fukano stands out with its ethereal fruity delights, the result of meticulous vigilance to preserve the spirit’s subtle nature. It brings a supple nose of lychee, ripe peaches, Smarties, watermelon, allspice, and white pepper. A light, slightly syrupy texture is underscored by watermelon and raspberry as it unwraps peach, nectarines, rhubarb, and custard candy, fruit Life Savers, stewed fruits, red berries, and light citrus.

90,Johnnie Walker Island Green,43.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"What happens when you light a bonfire underneath Green Label? Earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic, a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla, strands of citrus, and touches of menthol and aniseed. Smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee, growing smoky notes, and peppered mackerel push back the waxy, citrus elements. Now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
90,Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch No. 3 Triple Grain American Oak 10 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Wheat, corn, and malted barley are your three grains here. Orange grove before harvest, a rounded candied peel note, plenty of sweet grain, and creamy vanilla, all backed by gentle spice. Luscious and chewy caramel, taffy candy, lavishly rich orange, and glowing spice notes wrap around the tongue. It’s incredible how they can make this tasty blend of five whiskies look so devastatingly easy (when it’s not). Value Pick",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
90,Wild Turkey Rare Breed,,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Cotton candy, marshmallows roasting over an open campfire, baked apples, and cornbread batter start a whiskey that then offers hints of caramel apples, pumpkin pie, and roasted pecans. Water opens it up to more nuanced fruit, spice, and sweetness. Without water, brown-sugar butter dominates about mid-palate and leads to a long finish. Dilution makes this a completely different whiskey experience.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
90,Port Askaig 15 year old Sherry Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,109,"Matured in first-fill <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks, this is 20% peated whisky from 1997 and 80% fruitier whisky distilled in 2001. Earthy on the early nose, with bonfire smoke, vanilla, raisins, and prunes. The palate opens with sweet fruit notes and medium-dry sherry, giving way to nutmeg, brine, and peat. The finish features plain chocolate, bitter lemons, and a hint of smoky chili. £85",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
90,Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2017,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This is the sixth—and oldest—limited annual release of Loch Gorm, distilled in 2009 and aged in <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts. The nose is earthy, with raisins, dry spices, smoldering peat, and a not unpleasing hint of rubber. The palate is lively with spices, sherry, cherries, and iodine-soaked peats. Aniseed, sweet sherried peat, and tingling spices in the medium-length finish. (13,500 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
90,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch B517),,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Rich and bold, it’s loaded with caramel notes that range from macchiato to salted caramel chews. Then complexity sets in, with brown sugar, vanilla cake batter, cinnamon-dusted molasses cookies, candied pecans, brown-sugar butter, and cornbread. The key here is that each note appears with that initial caramel richness and follows this to the long, warm, and satisfying finish with a hint of spice.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2017
90,Chapter 7 (undisclosed Highland distillery),,Single Malt Scotch,180,"Swiss-based Chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt, a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1,476). Malt, sweet sherry, cocktail cherries, milky coffee, and a slightly earthy undertone on the nose. Very rich on the palate, with chewy-sweet soft fruits, notably strawberries, syrup sponge, and lively fruit spices. Mouth-drying in the long finish, with aniseed and wood spice. (1,076 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
90,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) 27 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,51,"This slippery little rogue exudes sweet popcorn, lemon peel, summer florals, linseed, and Quaker Oats pillows adrift in a sea of butterscotch sauce. Rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening, overcoming an active peppery middle section, then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes, corn, and fudge. Reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. Water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
90,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Elgin) 21 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,160,"This single cask bottling was distilled in December 1995 and matured in a refill hogshead (#258). Warm, sweet biscuit notes on the nose, plus almonds and tangerines. Substantial on the palate, with vanilla fudge and Jaffa orange. Softly spicy, with developing licorice. Long in the finish, with spicy licorice, plain chocolate, and light tannins. (258 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
90,Gordon & MacPhail 1954 (distilled at Glen Grant),40.0,Single Malt Scotch,2020,"This veteran expression was fully matured in first-fill sherry butts. Fragrant on the nose, with black treacle, prunes, raisins, lanolin, bung cloths, and polished oak. Big stewed fruit and warm leather notes on the palate, soon reeled in by spicy tannic oak, plus licorice and aniseed, though a stubborn dusty fruitiness persists. The finish is lengthy and mouth-drying, with lots of dark oak. A lovely example of its kind. £1,575",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
90,Gooderham & Worts Little Trinity 17 year old,45.0,Canadian,80,"The standard Gooderham &amp; Worts blends corn, wheat, barley, and rye whiskies. This special edition forgoes the barley but not the flavor. A lovely hard toffee start slides into a wealth of cereal notes: barley sugars, Cream of Wheat, and oatmeal. Lovely soft caramels send a smooth sweetness gliding over the palate. Little Trinity exemplifies luxurious mouthfeel as much as it does breadth of flavor.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2017
90,Alexander Murray & Co. The Monumental 30 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,140,"Sherry finishing influences, from leather satchel, maraschino cherry, floral blossoms, and deep orange notes to a pinch of Chinese Five Spice and buttered ginger loaf. Medium bodied, with a malt content of 75%, it riffs around an orange theme, at times quite sharp, with pith, some bitter grapefruit, more ginger, and herbal strands. Lively spices flicker across the tongue throughout the long finish as the citrus seeps away.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
90,Shackleton,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,35,"One hundred ten years after the Nimrod expedition, blender Richard Paterson’s adventurous marriage of over 20 Highland malts brings fresh green fruits, manuka honey, vanilla, banana muffin, cantaloupe, fresh herbs, spice, and a wisp of smoke. Refreshing palate of green melon, light honey, vanilla, cinnamon, cooked apple, and gooseberry, becoming sour. More complexity on the finish: spice, smoke, cooked fruits, and chalky Sweethearts candies. Pair with mature prosciutto.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017

90,Slane Irish Whiskey,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,30,"Brown-Forman deployed a triple-cask finishing process on mature sourced whiskeys, involving virgin oak, refill, and sherry casks. A lovely fruity complexity ensues, with blackberry, apple-toffee notes, malt, vanilla, and sherry influences. Butterscotch with nutty undertones, herbal notes verging toward spicy, and hints of dried apple, red berries, and a touch of leather roll into the finish. You want complexity, intrigue, and flavor for thirty bucks? Look no further.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
90,Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Rye (Barrel #17A34),,Rye Whiskey,150,"On the nose, a tapestry of candied fruit, dark caramel, and molasses. Then it’s herbs, ocean air, oak, fruit, roasted peanuts, pecan pie, and pie crust in the oven. Nuanced vanilla appears, but prominent black licorice, leather, burnt pumpkin bread, and tobacco dominate toward the end. A decently long finish gives a strong hint of bread pudding. This is definitely not your typical rye, but it sure is tasty.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
90,Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2010,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Quantities of Optic and Oxbridge barley varieties were grown on eight Islay family farms during 2009, and the following year this grain was distilled, then matured in bourbon and French wine casks. The nose offers ginger, melon, malt, sweet (lit) pipe tobacco, freshly baled straw, resin, vanilla, and spice. Chewy in the mouth; oily, with toffee spices and youthful oak notes. The finish features oysters with lemon squeezed over them.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
90,Deanston 40 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,1215,"This veteran expression from Deanston Distillery was matured in refill bourbon casks before spending no fewer than 10 years in <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts. Rose petals, fresh pineapple, clotted cream, cinnamon, and dusty oak on the enticing nose. Unctuous in the mouth, with apple pie, cinnamon, hazelnuts, and ginger. Drying slowly to pleasing fruity, tannic notes. Extremely long finish, with a persistent citric tang. (Less than 500 bottles globally)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
90,GlenDronach Cask Strength (Batch 6),,Single Malt Scotch,71,"The latest batch of cask strength GlenDronach should make Aberlour a’bunadh look to its laurels. It is matured in a combination of Pedro Ximenez and <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. The nose is quite perfumed, with sweet sherry, figs, nutmeg, satsumas, and candied peel. Voluptuous in the mouth, with early bright fruit notes, cinder toffee, and caramel, followed by darker sherry and raisin notes.

The finish is lengthy and redolent of toffee apples.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
90,Glen Moray 15 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks; the nose is initially relatively reticent, slightly earthy, with a hint of drinking chocolate, emerging sherry notes, and subtle orange. Toffee, more chocolate, and spicy dried fruits on the relatively full-bodied palate. Long in the finish, with wood spices.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
90,Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Single Barrel (barreled 2/11/2004),,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"When the caramel train comes, it rarely returns after such strong earthy notes of roots, hay, and soil. It’s the same story in the next round: first, pan-fried sweet potatoes and parsnips dominate; caramel returns with vanilla, allspice, and white pepper. Then the odd but welcomed combo of campfire-smoked marshmallows and gingersnaps just before a long caramel finish. Very unique.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
90,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Four Grain,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"This whiskey’s mashbill includes both rye and wheat. (Most bourbons contain one or the other, and usually it’s rye.) The sweet, inviting mellowness of the wheat is there; so is the spicy zing of the rye. Look for creamy caramel and soft vanilla peppered with fresh mint and warming cinnamon. Firm oak grip on the finish, with lingering spice. Dynamic and invigorating.",John Hansell,Summer 2017
90,West Cork Rum Cask Finish 12 year old,43.0,Irish,66,"The bright, sunny welcome of the rum cask greets you as you raise the glass to your nose. Honeycomb, golden syrup, fresh bread, and dry, powdered-spice aromas. The satin smooth palate boasts sweet melon and honey, developing caramel and orange oils, with a tail that turns slightly nutty. Worth a comparative tasting against Teeling Small Batch, this is an Irish whiskey to take you through the summer.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
90,Barrell 11 year old American Whiskey (Batch 004),,Miscellaneous,65,"A blend of whiskeys finished in rum and rye barrels, it’s molasses-forward with quick introductions of clove, vanilla, flowers, and strawberry. Green apple and ginger cookies appear before a burst of caramel chew, herbs, and chewing tobacco. At times fascinating for its rye, bourbon, and rum qualities, albeit a little hot, it’s a must-pour for a spirits lover.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
90,anCnoc Cutter,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Part of anCnoc’s Peaty Collection, Cutter has been distilled from malt peated to 20.5 ppm. The result is a dram with a nose of ashy peat and medicine cabinets, backed by vanilla and canned apricots. Rich peat on the palate, with citrus fruit and crème brûlée. The slightly oily finish is long and bonfire-like.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
90,Hyde No. 1 President’s Cask 10 year old,46.0,Irish,70,"Like an old confectionery shop, with fruit Life Savers, marshmallow, pear drops, coconut oil, and cherry notes. Ideal for those with a sweet tooth, it doles out tangy citrus, lemon peel, strawberry bubble gum, then evens out with a creamier mouthfeel and more red fruits; red currant and cranberry. Tangy and moreish once you weather the sugar rush, concluding with a lengthy finish of ripe fruits after a spicy flare.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
90,Knappogue Castle 16 year old Twin Wood Limited Release,40.0,Irish Single Malt,100,"The Twin Wood release is the result of refilling this triple distilled single malt from its bourbon casks into <em>oloroso</em> casks for a 21-month finishing period. This produced a wonderfully dry nose of macadamia nut, pepper, and baked apple crumble. Rich sweetness, more sherry fruit, and raspberry, which develop with plum notes, some bitter fruits, old chocolate, and a little heat.

Rich, layered, and rounded caramel, with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice. Then earth, and lots of it, over a slightly chewy mouthfeel of caramel chew and Red Hots cinnamon candy. Medium finish counters wonderful bouquet and palate notes, but still lovely for sipping.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
90,Highland Park Fire,,Single Malt Scotch,300,"Fire is the first Highland Park expression to be fully matured in “refill port wine-seasoned casks” and it carries a 15 year age statement. Very fruity on the nose—raspberries and prunes —plus lightly-smoked pineapple and vanilla. More smoky, spicy fruit features on the palate, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. The peat dries to leave ashy licorice and black pepper in a lingering finish. The port is pleasingly discreet. (4,938 bottles for the U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017

Earthy sherry and old leather on the nose, with toffee, polished oak, and cherry blossom.

90,The Macallan Edition No. 2,,Single Malt Scotch,105,"This limited release was aged in seven cask types—both American and European oak in a variety of sizes—from four Spanish bodegas: Vasyma, Diego Martin, Jose Miguel Martin, and Tevasa. Citrus fruits, ginger, black pepper, light smoke, and rubbery leather on the nose. Ultimately, carnations.

90,Masterson’s 10 year old Rye (batch PSH3),45.0,Canadian,89,"Insights developed from four generations making fine California wine are applied brilliantly to Masterson’s 100% rye-grain whisky. Finishing in Hungarian oak barrels lends softness to warm glowing spices, ripe Bing cherries, Granny Smith apples, and cocoa powder. Sandalwood follows, then Humbugs, farmy notes, sweet grainy beer mash, fragrant esters, and candy canes, on a slippery palate. Long, spicy, vanilla finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2017
90,Pike Creek Rum Finish 10 year old,42.0,Canadian,30,"Rum barrels replace port wood in a reformulated Pike Creek. The sweetness of the rum finish accommodates higher proof and an extra 5% shot of rye, making this Pike Creek slightly fatter than the original.

Hints of smoke, dried apricot, fresh-cut grass, and tilled earth. Then, raw honey, marzipan, raisins, and sweet oats, followed by baking spices for a medium to long finish.

It’s around 5 years old and matured in bourbon casks, with 24% of the composition using malt kilned to 39 parts per million.

90,Port Charlotte 10 Second Limited Edition,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This was matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, French wine, and <em>tempranillo</em> casks. Initial brine on the nose gives way to malt and orchard fruits, sweet smoke, and buttery malt. Sweet, medicinal smoke notes on the early palate, then toffee and peaches drying to aniseed and chili. Long and prickly in the finish, with licorice and black pepper. A complex rendering of Port Charlotte.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
90,Bruichladdich Octomore 10 Second Limited Edition,,Single Malt Scotch,235,"Distilled in December 2005 using malt peated to a whopping 167 parts per million, this was matured in a mix of bourbon and Grenache Blanc casks.

90,The Dubliner Irish Whiskey,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,28,"This just makes me happy. The nose brims with pure blossom honey, a dose of vanilla, whole peach, butter toffee, and an uplifting floral bouquet. A soothingly sweet and syrupy smooth concoction; this light-bodied whiskey of honey, caramel, and toffee feels like it should be dispensed with kindness in regular doses from a medicine spoon. The epitome of uncomplicated, easy-drinking, bourbon cask-matured whiskey.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
90,The Blender’s Dog,43.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,74,"The importance of master blender Billy Leighton to Jameson cannot be understated. His whiskey expresses smooth, creamy aromas with floral top notes; a treat of poached pear, golden delicious apple, and peppercorn spices. There’s a thick, clingy mouthfeel, with sweet barley sugar, gingersnaps, sultanas, and a peppery flare. Undoubtedly the best spicy pot character of the three Whiskey Makers series, and that warming spiciness plows on into a lengthy finish. €70",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
90,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2016,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Complexity right off. Cherry candied nuance, smoke, caramel, French toast, vanilla, and apricot, but then an explosion of marzipan coats the palate with vanilla, freshly baked rye bread, and hints of brown sugar, nutmeg, toasted almond, and bittersweet chocolate. Finally, cherry cola and herbs walk you to a lovely, long, bitter finish with warm undertones. This is a year-round front porch sipper.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
90,Thomas H. Handy Rye,,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Distilled in 2010, this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection, and is younger than last year’s release. I feel this is a slight liability, as it comes across a bit green and harsh for a Handy. Bold and spicy, with mint, clove, and cinnamon leading the way. Fig, caramel, and candied fruit round out the palate, but its youthfulness supersedes on the finish. One of the weaker offerings of Handy. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016.",John Hansell,Winter 2016
90,Kornog Sant Erwan 2016,50.0,Single Malt French Whisky,101,"Every May, Jean Donnay searches for an exceptional single cask to bottle in honor of the patron saint of Brittany. This fresh bourbon barrel was an inspired pick. Summer honey, creamed coconut, honeysuckle blossom, vanilla <i>panna cotta</i>, and an attractive turf-rich peat note leap from the glass. Tart and juicy, with tangerine imbued with peat, its journey takes on a delicious malty and chocolate character, arriving at a delectable final plateau of nutmeg. He’s found superb balance this year. €95",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
90,Box The 2nd Step Collection 02,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,81,"Expect six 2<sup>nd</sup> step bottlings, each showcasing different personalities of Box single malt; peating, wood, and cask size will be tweaked in pursuit of world-class quality. The twin pleasures of fruity sherry and smoke wrinkle the nostrils delightfully. An admirable balance: prudent use of peat, countered by apple, chocolate Kendal mint cake, nougat, and a fresh minerality. Resplendent in noble <i>oloroso</i>; think apple flapjacks, sultana, fig, maple syrup, and toffee banana, with a prickle of spice lasting into the finish. (5,000 bottles) SEK747",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
90,Barrell Bourbon 13 year old (Batch 009),,Bourbon/Tennessee,85,"Think of an Almond Joy candy bar: coconut, almond, and milk chocolate, followed by the candy bar’s rival flavors: caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch. Then oak, leather, cigar box, marmalade, grape jelly, a plethora of baking spices, and toffee. This beautiful study of barrel strength bourbon needs no water. Caramel in all forms, from candied to syrup, follows this home for a long and delightful finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
90,Buffalo Trace 15 Minute Infrared Light Wave Barrels,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Nicely rounded and very drinkable. Warming cinnamon, vanilla bean, and dried fruit, wrapped up in creamy caramel and light toffee. Pleasant, gently sweet finish. Great anytime. 375ml",John Hansell,Fall 2016

(The annual single barrel releases jumped last year from approximately 10 years old to 9 years old, with both a 2005 and 2006 vintage released in the same year.)

In true form, this bourbon is flavorful and well-rounded.",John Hansell,Fall 2016
90,Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel Elliott’s Select (2016 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,125,"There’s a certain complexity here that you just come to expect in limited edition Four Roses. This one doesn’t disappoint. Rose petals, honeysuckle, caramel, roasted pine nuts, cotton candy, dark coffee, and vanilla. The creamy mouthfeel delightfully brings in warm cinnamon roll, chocolate truffle, and honey taffy, balanced by herbs and subtle earthiness that settle with a long-lasting cinnamon-forward finish.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
90,George Dickel Distillery Reserve 17 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Tennessee whiskey shall not be undersold in this flavorful version. Rich notes of caramel and vanilla developing in yellow cake batter with dark caramel, brown sugar, leather, toasted pecans, and hints of walnut, smoked apple, and honey. Then red fruit, baking spice, and complex butterscotch over a palate-coating mouthfeel that’s perfectly warm and balanced all over. As good as it is, it could be better with ten more proof points. Its light proof shows in a shorter-than-desired finish. <em>(Tennessee only) </em>375ml",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
90,Glenfarclas 50 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Just pause for a moment before tasting. <em>50 years.</em> What has happened in the world during that time? How have you changed? What has it done to the whisky? Added a quiet elegance. It brings to mind elements of long-dried concentrated fruit and nut, damson, even smoke. The tannins are initially dusty, but a splash of water adds a fresh potpourri perfume. Is it expensive? For something that’s spent 50 years in a cask? No, it isn’t. (937 bottles) £1800",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
90,Lagavulin 18 year old Fèis Ìle 2016 bottling,,Single Malt Scotch,162,"It’s been quite a year for Lagavulin; a 25 year old is due (but no sample at the time of writing). This was a 6,000-strong bottling, aged in refill hoggies and ‘bodega’ butts. Initially restrained and mildly oxidized, it shows angelica, a spritz of lemon juice on potted shrimp, then fennel pollen and water mint. The smoke is pulled back. The palate has orchard fruits, creosote, and moss. Lagavulin’s top notes accentuated, but with the depth of age. £125",Dave Broom,Fall 2016
90,Limeburners Port Cask,43.0,Australian Whisky,104,"Aromas of black grape, sultana, fresh plum, and fennel seed arouse the senses. The Australian port-cask finish coats the bourbon characteristics, enriching rather than saturating, draping raspberry and cherry around caramels and runny honey. Sultana notes pull ahead, the whole experience becoming buttery in the final stretch as the spices balance out. More spice to the fore on the finish, pumping in the pepper while serving up rich cooked fruit. A highly respectable effort. A$135",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
90,Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 22 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,110,"Delightful opening of fruit, praline, caramel, maraschino cherries, and spice, with a burst of smoked paprika and a hint of leather. It’s soft on the palate, easily gliding down the jawline, filling with flavors of caramel chew, saltwater taffy, coffee, and a rich, toasted pumpernickel rye with just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Based on the taste, I’d think this flavorful beauty would offer a long finish, but misses the mark. Thankfully, spice over the medium finish is quite pleasant.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
90,House of Hazelwood 25 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,150,"Toasty granola, rye crackers, barley sugar sweetness, and Murray Mints make for a balanced nose on this top-of-the-range blend representing the art deco elegance of 1920s Shanghai. A gloriously thick texture of rich citrus blossoms bolstered by toffee, lime, pineapple, tropical fruits, and vanilla sugar. Mr. Kinsman has engineered methodical and well-paced complexity here, with emergent little lights of spiciness. A long-lasting, deep orange buzz and dimming spice round off proceedings. A precious joy indeed. £115 Travel Retail exclusive",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
90,Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Straight Rye (Barrel #16A113),,Rye Whiskey,150,"This rye has a lot going on. The palate ranges from herbs, caramel, cotton candy, honeysuckle, and rose petals, to chocolate, malt, black pepper, honey, and slightly burnt pizza crust. The whiskey sits on the palate, richly giving red fruit and pepper spice with a slight hint of banana on the end. The taste is magnificent. If the medium finish was just a little longer, this would venture into greatness.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
90,Ballantine’s Limited,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,229,"If Willy Wonka was ever inclined to condense a knickerbocker glory into a dram, it would nose and taste like this: caramel toffee, hints of cocoa, peeled banana, chewy marshmallows, cream, and gooey fudge sauce. The palate has banana, slightly burnt caramel, poached pear, and Banoffee pie layered over mixed peel flavors, adding to its delicious appeal. It’s sweet, dry, smooth, and comforting, like that final satisfying mouthful drained from a mug of hot chocolate. Comfort food for thirsty people.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
90,Henry McKenna Single Barrel Bottled in Bond 10 year old,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,33,"One of the few remaining age-stated bourbons. Henry McKenna’s color is beautiful. You can hold it up in sunset light and just enjoy the russet and amber hues reflecting. Sweetness, savory, and floral fragrances followed by brown sugar, fresh-baked rye bread, and malt. Caramel and vanilla, with roasted pine nuts and spice, and a slight hint of strawberry lead to a long and savory finish. Balance is the point of this sipper.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
90,Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Rye,47.0,Rye Whiskey,50,"With a mashbill of 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley, this rye doesn’t disappoint. Butter-toasted rye bread and vanilla, with hints of herbs and campfire smoke. Then fruit…a lot of fruit: pear, banana, pineapple, followed by a bevy of sweets—caramel, butterscotch, and toffee, mainly—with a delightful cinnamon bread finish. This skews more toward bourbon than the Indiana ryes, and that’s a good thing.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
90,Canadian Rockies 35 year old,50.0,Canadian,607,"What a shame this whisky will sail to Taiwan with nary a bottle left for North America. It would be the oldest and most expensive Canadian whisky on the continent. And bottled at 50%, one of the strongest. Wood, age, toffee, cooked sweet corn, fruit, and slightly dusty new jeans. Gloriously sweet, showing its ABV in a blistering pepper attack that subsides into sweetness and a mild fruitiness<em>. </em>(<em>Taiwan only</em>) NT$19,800",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
90,Canadian Rockies 35 year old Cask Strength,,Canadian,684,"Matured in bone-dry Alberta, where the angels quenched their thirst with water, not alcohol, and the strength steadily climbed over the 35 years spent in wood. Butterscotch, but no inkling of spirit, yet blistering heat on the palate. Surprisingly smooth, though your tongue simply glows. Water adds complexity: dry grain, fresh denim, dust, peaches, green apples, sweet woodiness, and a long blazing finish. Pretty spectacular<em>. </em>(<em>Taiwan only</em>) NT$22,310",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2016
90,Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve (Lot 1867-F),40.0,Canadian,50,"Each batch is a little bit different, this one leaning to sweet orchard fruits, nutty barley, and hot spicy rye. Butterscotch and vanilla on the nose translate well onto the palate. Brisk peppery spice underlies developing layers, adding another dimension of complexity to an already broad range of flavors. Hints of oak tannins on the finish remind us this was finished in Canadian wood.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2016
90,The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1968 46 year old (Cask# 7293),,Single Malt Scotch,,"The oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude. The dried blossoms of youth are there, still with a little color to them, while a curl of smoke also comes through. Then, out of nowhere, a sudden eruption of tropical fruits, a flaring in the dying light. There’s no oakiness, just a distillery, framed, gently receding. A remarkable dram. It’s almost shameful to discuss cost! £19,000",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
90,Laphroaig 32 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A (very) special anniversary bottling, this is old-style, brooding Laphroaig. Fully mature and rich, it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp, oil, and brine, always balanced by sweetness: in this case autumn berry fruits. Malt adds a crunchiness. The palate is gentle and slow with the characteristic camphoraceous lift of bog myrtle on the back palate, which is all that remains of the smoke. Pricey, yes, but rare. Get saving!",Dave Broom,Spring 2016
90,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2015 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,170,"The Angel’s Envy Cask Strength port cask finished bourbon has developed a cult following, and it’s easy to see why. Jumping out are marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, roasted nuts, with a hint of cardamom, coffee, and nutmeg, but true beauty lies in the pronounced pumpkin pie, dark chocolate, raw pine nut, caramel, and sweet maltiness. I’d love for this whiskey to finish longer, but it does give a hint of nutmeg toward the end. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
90,That Boutique-y Whisky Co (distilled at Overeem) Batch 1,,Australian Whisky,218,"Fresh, clean aromas of key limes, the waxy leaves of tropical greenhouse foliage, and creamed coconut encased in chocolate. Plenty of acidity and exotic spices at play. There’s a bouquet of citrus and botanical notes to sip. Smooth with a big slug of warmth: white peach, nectarine, melon, ground almond, sliced lemon, with spicy undertones. The finish is complex with plum skin, cooked gooseberry, tangerine oils, and tingle of sherbet. A little beauty, though the outturn seems woefully meager. (50 bottles) £150",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
90,Caledonian ‘The Cally’ 1974 40 year old,,Single Grain Whisky,1200,"If your glass is half empty, you might overlook this because it is the most expensive single grain Scotch whisky released to date. If your glass is half full, you will relish sweet toffee popcorn, coconut, fresh fruits, linseed oil, and some spicy and nutty notes. Makes sense, as South African white maize was heavily used in the production in the early 1970s. It’s mouth filling, dark and brooding, with plenty of chocolate, oak tannins, char, and layered spice. Sumptuous. (5,060 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
90,Old Beezer (Batch No. 1) 10 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,52,"From Kentucky, the journey begins with generous at-the-fair candy corn and subtle hints of vanilla, caramel, and smoke. I find the caramelized grains and spice just as appealing. While the hint of maple syrup is nice, this is simple goodness with every taste. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
90,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,43.0,Japanese,65,"Poised and complex, with typically lifted fruitiness: strawberry ice cream, pineapple, peach, balanced by delicate oak, bamboo shoot-like delicacy, then lemon. The palate is more rounded than that very forward nose, with toffee notes adding some weight. A touch of smoke comes along in the mid-palate, before fruits and caramelized coffee biscuits. Water allows the flavors to flood the palate. Exemplary blending skills and classically Hibiki.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
90,Abraham Bowman High Rye Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"“Contains five times more rye than A. Smith Bowman’s standard bourbon recipe,” aged 7 years and 9 months. A lean bourbon nose: sweet grain, leather, pepper, oak. Zing in the mouth! Quite spicy, with a smooth, oily feel, notes of dried apple and split fruit-tree branches, and a driving but welcome heat that lines straight through to the long, dry finish. Bold, interesting, and worthy of repeating! Limited release; mainly in Virginia.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
90,Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Rye,45.0,Craft Whiskey,39,"Dad’s Hat rye has evolved, like many craft whiskeys, but they’re still bottling at 6 to 9 months (another label is planned for a straight version). That’s working well. The nose is rip-roaring rye: crushed grain, grass, sweet spice, bitter herbal notes, with all the complexity of the grain. Delivers honestly on the tongue, too, plus a light barrel character, proceeding to an integrated finish. Excellent young rye, there’s no mistaking the mother grain.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
90,Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel (Barrel 15-4956),,Bourbon/Tennessee,65,"Hot barrel wood, like opening a rickhouse in July; light allspice, vanilla, and fiery alcohol. Drinkable without water, surprisingly. Hot syrup, corn sugar caramel, tannic oak, and a bit of stickiness. An interesting look at Jack Daniel’s: unblended, undiluted, untamed. It’s still Jack—sweet, insistent—but it’s taller, bigger. I could say I’d like even more heft, more complexity…but would that be asking Jack to be something it simply is not?",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
90,Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 40 year old,,Grain Scotch Whisky,390,"This is an amazing link back to Glasgow in the 1970s. Fresh peach, cherry blossom, red Tunes, baked apple, hay bales, acetone, orange peel, and old pepper grinders. A silky texture with red apple, orange oils, and a luxuriantly refined taste leads to apple peelings, caramel, and ginger. Such quality! The finish slips away quietly: melon, peach, fudge, and a final twist of pepper. Bliss! Great to see Douglas Laing bringing out more XOP single grains of such standing. (150 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
90,Scallywag Cask Strength,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,76,"As if this cheeky devil from Douglas Laing wasn’t good enough already! Strawberry <em>napoleon</em>, mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb, runny honey, fresh peach, and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light, then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy, touching blood orange, fizzy sweeties become taffy candy, then sherbet. Eventually pacified, it becomes milky and sweet, with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother’s embrace. £50",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
90,Yellowstone Limited Edition,,Bourbon/Tennessee,105,"Blends 7 and 12 year old bourbons, and a 7 year wheater, in a beautifully packaged tribute to the old brand. Typical nose—cinnamon Red Hots, milled corn, oaky zest—in balanced harmony. Beautiful stuff on the tongue: warm but not hot, expansive corn sweetness that lightens the cinnamon’s intensity, some clove, some oaky dryness. The warm finish only ends after a long embrace. Pricey for 7 year old bourbon, though; is this the future? Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
90,Gooderham & Worts,,Canadian,34,"Innovation is key at Windsor’s Corby Distillers. Though best known for its Wiser’s range, Corby also makes this juicy new four-grain beauty. Big and firm on the palate, G&amp;W glides into a buttery corn-whisky slather flooded with delicate rye flowers, nutty dusty barley, and soft, sweet wheat notes. Want the list? Crisp clean oak, citrus pith, stewed fruits, meadow flowers, and brisk pepper with mildly pulling tannins. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$45",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
90,Compass Box The Peat Monster,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,60,"A fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real, grubby peat: more blazing, bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. Fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering, mellow cigar stubs. A smooth, creamy blend with lemon curd, vanilla sponge, mint, smoked prosciutto, and a dollop of malt. There’s wonderfully smoky, singeing heat at the back of the palate, though it feels like the Islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. A succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
90,Glenfarclas 17 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,99,"Weighty and deep. Instantly seductive: vanilla pod, rich fruits, the smell of fur coats. A <em>femme fatale</em> of a malt. A base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. Water brings out apple leaf, even a little grassiness. The palate is broad and balanced, with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit, earthy density, with a whiff of smoke. Redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. A class act.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
90,Low Gap 2 year old Rye,,Craft Whiskey,65,"A malted rye whiskey, aged in new, bourbon, and Germain-Robin cognac barrels. Cereal grains are the star of this nose, which supports the rye grain with oak and cinnamon spice. The palate follows the grain-focused nose and is a carefully crafted love note to rye grain, featuring multi-grain cereal, cinnamon, ginger, sawdust, and a touch of oak. The finish is all dark chocolate, rye grain, and cinnamon spice; a delicious, close to expertly-crafted whiskey.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
90,Rock Town 5th Anniversary Arkansas Straight Bourbon,50.0,Craft Whiskey,50,"Aged for 4 years and bottled in bond, this bourbon has a mash of Arkansas grown grains, including 73% corn, 9% wheat, and 18% barley. Dark amber in color, a robust nose spotlights cinnamon, oak, and black pepper. The palate is an enjoyable journey from sweet caramel corn to spicy cinnamon and oak. Cinnamon is the star in the mid-palate, where it’s well supported by the underlying alcohol. A long and slightly dry finish caps off a craft whiskey done right.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
90,William Grant Rare Cask Reserves Blended Reserve 26 year old,42.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,399,"William Grant &amp; Sons will be releasing a series of Ghosted Reserves in the years ahead, drawing on their remaining stock from closed distilleries. Here, Brian Kinsman has used whisky from Ladyburn and Inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie, peach, butter mintoes, and sweet oak. It is truly moreish, with creamy, malty flavors of sweet mandarin, marzipan, and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. Exceptionally good whisky. (<em>6,000 bottles)</em>",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
90,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Miltonduff) 22 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,127,"Immediate <em>rancio</em> notes, with some hazelnut and cheese rind. Added oxidative notes of nuts moves things into Brandy de Jerez territory. Sumptuous stuff, with Miltonduff’s floral character adding a delicate top note, something which is enhanced with water. The tannins are light, allowing a silky feel to predominate, with just enough of a bitter edge to add interest. Very good indeed.<i> </i>£81",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
90,The Sovereign (distilled at Dumbarton) 50 year old 1964,,Single Grain Whisky,453,"Incredible! This dark golden dram was distilled in the same year that the Beatles first played in America. An aromatic nose of fruit spangles, gentle acetone, clove, eucalyptus, vanilla pods, and tamarind. Soft, gentle apple flavors with a silky texture; sweet orange, vanilla, ginger, spice, and raspberry. The oak is mouth-puckering unless you add water (and you can). A finish of Starburst chews, although a soft presence, slowly drying from the oak. Simply gorgeous, experiential whisky. (<em>93 bottles</em>) £290",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
90,Midleton Dair Ghaelach Grinsell’s Wood,,Irish,250,"Virgin Irish oak-finished Midleton single pot still whiskeys aged from 15 to 22 years take pot still into exciting new territory. The native pot still spiciness is enveloped by chocolate-covered honeycomb, toasty oak, spotty bananas, and a barista’s coffee scoop, though a dash of water picks out lemongrass and rubbed mint. A silky smooth mouthfeel of succulent fruits is shaken down with cocoa powder. Black currant squares up as heavy pot incarnate. Clove-spiked stewed apple weighs into a lengthy finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
90,Ardbeg Perpetuum,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"“Ardbeg in Perpetuum” would mean “Ardbeg forever.” It’s made up of a mélange of different casks: American oak, refill, French oak…and others. Intense, marine, with pineapple, wet moss, tar, cracked black pepper, and a nuttiness. The palate is oily, sweet, with smoked cream, balanced by a very pure acidity, then soot and char. Will the fact that it isn’t an extreme Ardbeg satisfy everyone? Probably not. Is it a bloody good session drink? Damn right it is. <em>(200<sup>th</sup> anniversary bottling)</em>",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
90,Tamdhu Batch Strength,,Single Malt Scotch,88,"Ian MacLeod’s first release of Tamdhu was a belter. Now, finally, it’s been joined by this high-strength NAS. There’s no hint of the high strength on the nose, which is all caramel toffee and shortbread, backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. The palate is the same: nut, dark fruits, and date. Hugely approachable. With water, it’s a matter of…chocolate? Maltesers! All you want in a sherried whisky, and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either. £60",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
90,Canadian Club 1970s,40.0,Canadian,102,"Sometimes, when whisky is batched, a few leftover barrels are returned to the warehouse. Canadian Club recently pulled and vatted several of these from the 1970s. Acetone, Granny Smith apples, and fresh-cut white cedar showcase this long age. Complex and spicy, yet reserved, this dram is ripe with strawberries, canned pears, cloves, pepper, and faint flowers, then slightly pulling oak tannins. Distinct, elegant, and remarkably vibrant, this ancient Canadian Club is anything but tired. <em>(Australia only) </em>A$133",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
90,Henry McKenna Single Barrel 10 year old (cask #4535811),50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,32,"At 10 years old and 50% ABV, you’d expect this whiskey to pack a power punch, and while it does present solid oak and beautiful cinnamon spice, it does so with great finesse. This barrel of Henry McKenna is a great showcase of many classic bourbon notes: caramel, cinnamon, oak, orange, clove, and kettle corn. The flavors are well integrated, balanced, and backed by a wonderfully lush undertone. A solid finish that cools slightly caps off a textbook affable whiskey. (<em>Drink Up New York only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
90,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Cured Oak,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The barrel staves used to age this whiskey dried outside in the open for 13 months. The oak influence is certainly evident—both from the cured oak staves and from the fact that the whiskey is 17 years old—but never overpowers. Plentiful spice notes (especially cinnamon and vanilla) are tamed by lovely sweetness (toffee, dates, nougat) and energized by bright fruit. Long, dry, warming finish. One of the better Taylors.",John Hansell,Summer 2015
90,Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenrothes) 17 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,117,"Light gold. A beautiful oxidized note, with soft fruitcake, steamed pudding, a little hint of overripe fruits, and sweet spices. As it opens, there’s barley sugar sweets, then custard tart with nutmeg, clover honey, and marzipan. Complex, in other words. Water shows how well-layered it is. It starts sweetly in the mouth with a thick, honeyed texture, which becomes more delicate with water. Elegant, long, and a great example of mature ’Rothes. £80",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
90,The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Garioch) 20 year old 1994 (cask #15),,Single Malt Scotch,160,"An old-style whisky that harkens back to a time when Scotland wasn’t sliced and diced by region, but defined by style. This is meaty with a capital M, with a rich, oily, deep character. On the palate it’s big and beautiful, with salt, oyster shell, honey, roasted green pepper, smoke, dried fruit, beef jerky, leather, and oak. Earthy peat smoke dances throughout, giving support but never stealing focus. This is about as masculine as Highland whisky gets. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2015
90,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old wheated bourbon from floor #1,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.



Gentle and easygoing. Creamy texture, with layered sweet notes of caramel, vanilla, marzipan, and crème brûlée. Soft background spice lingers on a delicate, soothing finish. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Spring 2015
90,Cutty Sark Art Deco Limited Edition 33 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,989,"Imagine sipping this sophisticated libation at the supper club turned out in your best bib and tucker. There’s a purity to it, with aromas of fresh red apples, raisins in honey, ground cinnamon, and nutmeg, leading to bitter orange oils and a storm of black pepper fading to tropical fruit, layered caramel, and sugared almonds. Hold this long in the mouth, as it possesses a changing, multi-faceted character. As Cab Calloway said, “This is <em>Hep.</em>” (3,456 bottles) £650",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
90,WhistlePig The Boss Hog II: The Spirit of Mortimer 13 year old (Barrel #1),,Canadian,189,"More Canadian core rye from WhistlePig, this time at full-bore. It’s strong with rye, sweet with melon and dark chocolate notes, but with a wood character like the unfinished inside of an antique oak wardrobe. The antique wood is strong in the mouth, an oddly elegant note, but afterward comes the melon and chocolate, and oily, coiling rye. Interestingly complicated; a bit hard to make friends, but worth the time and effort.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
90,Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Rye American Oak Finish (Barrel A2-062),45.0,Canadian,65,"A medley of well-integrated, bright flavors including acetone, green apples, soft floral perfume, vague tannins, sweet pipe tobacco, brown sugar, hints of spar varnish, fresh-cut wood, vanilla galore, soft well-integrated spices, and subdued white pepper. It feels like corn syrup, with hot spices on the sides of the tongue and hints of oak lumber throughout. Rich and full, yet light, fresh, and estery. Long, lingering, hot spices on a sweet, slightly fruity finish. Ends on cinnamon bark. <em>(U.S. only)</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
90,Armorik Millésime 2014,,French Whisky,102,"This third single cask release was distilled in 2002 and spent two-thirds of its maturation in <em>oloroso</em> after 4 years in bourbon wood. The nose brings cranberry, bramble, smoked meats over a pit fire, stewed apple, Worcestershire sauce, and damp sphagnum. The taste is silky, displaying an array of citrus and red berry fruits. It’s amazingly gentle and tender given the strength. Water brings cider apples, ginger, and spices with a finish of bubblegum and boiled mint candies. €90",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
90,Big Peat Christmas Edition 2014,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,70,"Brace yourself. This takes peat to the extreme, conjuring up a moist, chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. So smoky, you will feel like you’re breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. A punchy thwack of peat at full strength, and even if you cut it with water, it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. A deliberately singular character, but utterly brilliant nonetheless. £46",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
90,Canadian Rockies 21 year old (Batch 002),40.0,Canadian,79,"A symphony of delicate exotic fruits in light syrup. The silky mouthfeel bolsters flourishes of sourish kumquats and tangerines, while a delicate oaky foundation supports bursts of hot peppery spices. Sweet Christmas spices harmonize gently with creamy vanilla. Persimmon, mild pears, sweet lemon, sandalwood, and hints of incense each take their turn. The sweet citrus finish is a fitting finale to a subtle yet complex and seamlessly integrated dram that carefully balances heat with fruit. <em>(Taiwan only) </em>NT$2,500",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
90,Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Glenrothes) 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,104,"Deep amber. Big, resinous, and almost heathery, with significant cask influence for a decade-old dram. The aroma is like a cobbler’s workshop: oils, leather, grease, polish, and then licorice. On the palate, there’s the prune notes of armagnac, the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum, and very Rothes-esque spiciness. Water, just a drop, lightens it a little, allowing the underlying sweetness to show. Not cask dominated, just bottled at exactly the right moment. Recommended. £68",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
90,SIA,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,50,"This Kickstarter-funded blend is a very savvy and seamless mix of 40% malt and 60% grain whiskies. Pale gold in color, the nose is inviting, with dried apricot, honey, tangerine, and salt. Everything from the nose comes together on the palate, which is soft and sweet with the right amount of oak and smoke to balance everything out. There&#039;s a dash of heat and a solid finish. Who&#039;d ever expect such a smart and affable whisky to come from Kickstarter? (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
90,Compass Box The Lost Blend,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,120,"The smoking wicks of church candles, smoked meat, coastal notes, cumin, coriander seed, and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches, citrus, and pineapple, with a waxy presence building later on, settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered, complex, thought provoking, and finely tuned for the connoisseur.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
90,Port Charlotte Islay Barley 2008,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,87,"Robust Port Charlotte character, with salami and <em>jamon serrano</em> to the fore. Somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day, but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. With water, the lovely smell of cow’s breath. There’s dry smoke to start with on the palate, becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. For me, PC comes fully of age here. £55",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
90,Caol Ila 30 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,700,"More smoke than is common from this distillery and age. The aromas are food-related: initially roast ham with caramelized sugars, then a clambake, then oven-roasted lobster. With water, a distinct whiff of the goat shed (nice, by the way). The palate is refined and mature, but with fresh fruits retained, with oak and smoke beautifully integrated. A mature Caol Ila in similar vein to the excellent (and significantly more keenly priced) 25 year old. (7,638 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
90,Elijah Craig 23 year old (Barrel No. 26),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"Yes, 23 years is a long time to age bourbon. And yes, there’s plenty of oak influence. But there’s an underlying sweetness that balances the oak spice (with this particular cask; others may vary). Chewy in texture, with toffee, dates, fig cake (with nuts), barrel char, tobacco, leather, and a dusting of cocoa.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
90,St. George Single Malt Lot 14,43.0,Craft Whiskey,80,"This release is based on a mash done at Sierra Nevada brewery, aged in eight different types of casks (including apple brandy and white wine) running from 4 to 15 years old. Delicate fruit, nuts, and sweet malt combine like perfect pastry in the nose. Add a bit of unsweetened chocolate on the palate, finishing with a lingering reminiscence of every bit of flavor, and you have a beautifully integrated whiskey that is unmistakably St. George. Delightful.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2014
90,Craigellachie 13 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,53,"Light amber. The initial impression is one of bulk. There are heavy florals — think lilies and stewed white fruit, and just-overripe banana — but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness, accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. The palate is, unsurprisingly, thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. A highly physical, old-style Speyside dram with classic distillery character. A statement whisky that is a must-try.",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
90,Adelphi (distilled at Mortlach) 26 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,295,"Amber. Very meaty, with a touch of cordite, then dark fruits, wet earth, and autumn woods, cut with spicy licorice and Darjeeling tea. Water brings down this exuberance, adding iris and whole grain bread. The palate has typical, full-on Mortlach brawny muscle, with chestnut honey-glazed venison. Water bringing out sweetness, but without ever losing that glowering core. Lovers of the old 16 year old apply here.",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
90,Scotch Malt Whisky Society Berber Whiskey With a Hint of Smoke 53.199 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Much of Caol Ila’s malt goes into Johnnie Walker blends, so it’s a rare treat to see a cask strength offering. This release is Caol Ila on steroids, featuring a deeply smoky and meaty nose with bacon, campfire, leather, sea salt, and iodine. On the palate, the smoky fire continues to burn with intense smoke and salt combined with sweet honey malt.  An extremely long finish will have you exhaling smoke long after the dram is gone. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
90,The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at Invergordon) 1972,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,246,"Holy Moly! Where do they find them? Over 40 years old and this seizes your attention with a becoming nose of smoked ham, sweet paprika, and red currant jelly. It’s extremely fruity with just the right level of tartness to keep it in balance; pomegranate, strawberry laces, crystalized fruits, and a nip of licorice adding to the richness and emerging creaminess before a dry finish of Victoria plums. Simply a gorgeous old grain. (<em>300 bottles for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan</em>) £155",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
90,Celtic Cask Cúig 1991,46.0,Irish,435,"Despite the vintage statement, this is 13 year old single pot still matured in first-fill bourbon. Apparently, it was MIA for eight years before being bottled. Peeled apples, crackerbread, Quaker oats, ripening pears, cappuccino sprinkles, and lightly toasted spices make for a well-composed and inviting prospect. Enveloping and oily with <em>tarte aux pommes</em>, fruit polos, allspice, and ground ginger. After a brief effervescent fizzle, it expands to become creamier and the spices carry on long after you have swallowed. €350",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
90,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old bourbon from floor #5,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.



Similar sweet notes as its sibling aged in floor #1 (caramel, honey, ripe fruit), but with an additional layer of dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla, clove) to accompany it. It has all the components of a fine bourbon, and it’s also nicely balanced, with good oak grip on the finish. The best of the three. Price is per 375 ml",John Hansell,Fall 2014
90,Bowmore 15 year old Laimrig,,Single Malt Scotch,118,"This Bowmore has been finished in sherry casks, but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. Instead, there’s concentrated stone fruits, lifted smoke, dried mint, dark chocolate, bitter orange peels, and some smoke. There’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits, then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. Long, layered, with the smoke seamlessly involved, adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. <em>(Whisky Shop chain only) </em>£70",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
90,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1990 (Cask #1362),,Single Malt Scotch,379,"Although the youngest of the range, this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  The nose is highly concentrated, with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. There’s also some tobacco and then an earthy, armagnac-esque pruniness. Water brings out a resinous element, supple leather, and fruit syrups, allowing it to retain complexity. The driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big, sherried, malts. £225",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
90,Glengoyne 25 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,421,"The latest addition to Glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old, matured in European oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. Syrup-like on the nose, very sweet, with milk chocolate, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and sticky toffee pudding. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with overt sherry, sultanas, and gentle spice. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of oak, old leather, and lingering cloves. Bold, yet elegant. £250",Gavin Smith,Fall 2014
90,Knob Creek,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,32,"Knob was one of the first bourbons I had when I started taking whiskey seriously, and it’s still a kicker. No-nonsense, flint-hard nose: slickly-polished oak furniture, cinnamon stick, cracked rye, wet cornmeal, hard candies. Bang! A lean whiskey that gets in your mouth and explodes with rye spice and cinnamon candy, a sharp wedge that opens you right up. The finish echoes: oak, a dying fire, clean and almost crisp. Emphatic, bright, and swift. Value Pick",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
90,The Lost Distilleries Blend (Batch Four),,Blended Scotch Whisky,587,"An enticing blend of aged single malt and grain whiskies from silent stills, top-dressed with Port Ellen. The nose has soft fudge, rosehip, and honey lozenges, with a thread of peat sewn through it. A distinct smokiness hangs above the glass. A mouthful exudes lemon sherbet, honey-drizzled melon, and white chocolate, peaking with raspberry and mixed peel before a conclusion of banana-layered banoffee pie. An elegant finish of baked lemon and sweet oak. One for reflection. £350",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
90,Edgefield Distillery Hogshead,46.0,Craft Whiskey,40,"An American single malt whiskey that brings together the sensibilities of American craft with traditional Scottish and Irish styles with great result. Hogshead’s nose is bright and acidic, with pear, apple, maple, cinnamon, and malted grain. The palate is much spicier than expected, but enjoyably so, with black pepper, oak, cinnamon, and clove mixing well with honeyed malt and pear. The finish is long and slightly dry with a dash of heat. An impressive entry in the craft category.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
90,BenRiach Septendecim 17 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,80,"No hiding that this is one of BenRiach’s peated variants, with smoke coming at you like an out of control garden bonfire, but the inherent sweetness of the distillery character adds a counterpoint: cinnamon-dusted apples baking in the fire, before angelica and cannabis (someone tells me) come through. The interplay between fruits and grassy smoke continues on the palate alongside toffee, nougat, peach syrup, and salty licorice before the smoke returns. A belter. And a great price.",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
90,Glenmorangie Companta,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,99,"Companta—Gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of Glenmorangie’s Private Edition releases. It comprises a blend of whiskies finished in Clos de Tart Grand Cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from Côtes du Rhône. Big fruity, leathery notes on the nose. Spicy, with sultanas, almonds, and icing sugar. The palate is rich and complex, with cocoa powder, nutmeg, more leather, and redcurrants. Long and fruity in the finish, with vibrant spices. Red berries predominate.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
90,Mortlach Rare Old,,Single Malt Scotch,93,"The introductory expression of the range shows a further example of the widening of the Mortlach style. Stewed and dried fruits mingle with light earth notes, wet Labrador, supple shoe leather, and varnish. A drop of water is all that’s needed to add a savory element and even some funky fruitiness reminiscent of cooking agave. The palate is big and chocolaty with some meat underneath. Hefty but elegant. The distillery character is not only intact, but enhanced. £55/500 ml",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
90,Mortlach Special Strength,49.0,Single Malt Scotch,127,"This is Rare Old at higher strength for folks who haunt Travel Retail outlets. The upping of strength also changes the dynamic, making things sweeter with mushed berries and Seville orange, but also deeper, with more overt meatiness, stewed tea, and the same varnished note. Dense, thick, stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and, with water, burning rosemary and dry licorice. Similar, but with more heft. £75/500 ml",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
90,Springbank 21 year old 2014 release,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,307,"The latest limited release of 21 year old Springbank has been matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Sherry and bourbon notes are well integrated on the early nose, which follows up with succulent tropical fruits, toffee, and a whiff of earthy peat. The palate is complex, confident, and oily, with dry sherry notes, almonds, figs, vanilla, wood smoke, and a hint of the sea. The lengthy finish boasts caramel, cinnamon, brine, and soft peat. £182",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
90,High West A Midwinter Night’s Dram (Act 1),,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"An exciting blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Beautifully spiced (warming cinnamon, crisp mint), tamed by caramel and vanilla fudge. Red and black raspberry, plum, dried citrus, and wood shavings add complexity. Warming finish. Nicely balanced and very distinctive. (<em>Distillery only</em> <em>until October 1<sup>st</sup>, then nationally</em>)",John Hansell,Summer 2014
90,WhistlePig The Boss Hog 12 year old Single Barrel,67.0,Rye Whiskey,150,"Brighter, bigger, and cleaner than its 10 year old stablemate (sty mate?), The Boss Hog squeals delightedly with spring flowers, fall fruit stands, heavy spicy cloves, and delicate esters. The alcohol tickles your nose but is soft on the palate, where fresh-baked rye bread mingles with dusty rye flour and Werther’s caramels. Fruity currents rise over sweet hot chocolate before the sweet spiciness returns for a long, slow fade. Great cask-strength whiskey with no need for water.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
90,Bushmills Rum Cask #10623,43.0,Irish Single Pot Still,125,"Irish whiskey and rum aren&#039;t a common combination, but Bushmills makes a strong case for it with a 19 year old whiskey finished in a rum cask. The rum&#039;s influence is clearly present on the nose, with brown sugar that supports Bushmills’ toasted malt. On the palate the rum&#039;s dark molasses complements Bushmills’ chocolate malty goodness. Everything balances out in the mid-palate with the addition of oak, which carries through to a semi-dry finish. Superb integration of unlikely cask mates.  <em>(Park Avenue Liquor only)</em>",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
90,Glen Deveron 30 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,422,"Initially, the nose is very different than that of the younger Glen Deverons, with brown paper and malt vinegar. Becoming buttery, with coconut ice and citrus fruit. Ultimately, a caramel note reminiscent of the 16 year old (see below). Rich and waxy on the palate, with dark berry fruits, almonds, vanilla, and treacle. Sweet and sour. The medium-length finish offers green berries and a hint of aniseed. Real depth of flavor and individuality here. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain.   £250/700 ml",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
90,Barterhouse 20 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Surprisingly lacking in oak intensity, given its age. Very creamy and soothingly sweet, with notes of honeyed vanilla, crème brûlée, sultana, orange creamsicle, peach cobbler, and a subtle array of tropical fruit. Soft and mellow on the finish. It’s very easy-drinking and should be enjoyable under most moods and circumstances.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
90,Redemption Barrel Proof Rye (Batch 3),61.0,Rye Whiskey,70,"6 year old MGP rye at full Booker’s-style unfiltered proof. Strong barrel/warehouse reek, some pepper, and a hint of dill. Shock: drinkable at 61%. Rich barrel flavors: oak, light maple, and custardy vanilla, albeit quite hot. Mint and pepper zip around the mouth; now on the tongue, now on the roof, racing down the throat, a big, active whiskey. Finish bubbles on with pepper and prickle, daring you to stick in a quarter and ride it again. An experience.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2014
90,The Dalmore 25 year old,42.0,Single Malt Scotch,975,"Dalmore 25 year old comprises spirit matured initially in American oak casks, some of which is then transferred into first-fill bourbon barrels, while the remainder goes into Palomino <i>fino</i> sherry butts. The two batches are then reunited in bourbon barrels before a final finishing in tawny port pipes. Vanilla, figs, toffee, and ripe oranges on the festive nose, while the palate features more orange, peaches, milk chocolate, and sherry. The chocolate darkens in the lengthy finish, with ginger and licorice.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
90,Glenglassaugh 40 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,2000,"Glenglassaugh has altered its policy of offering single cask expressions of its 40 year old, and replaced these with a vatting of casks to provide an ongoing release program, offered at cask strength and without chill filtration. The nose is pleasingly complex, with ginger, honey, milk chocolate, icing sugar, sherry, plums, and new leather. Resinous on the palate, with pineapple and brittle toffee, then black coffee and aniseed. A spicy oakiness ultimately develops. Drying steadily in the finish, with licorice and oak tannins. £1,200",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
90,Charbay S Whiskey Lot 211A,,Craft Whiskey,135,"Distilled from Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout, alambic pot distilled, aged 29 months in used French oak. Gooey nose, with lots of dark chocolate, toffee, fruit (ripe honeydew, Asian pear, red plum); no hint of the 49.5% ABV heat. Deliciously layered palate: dry malt, juicy fruit, and savory wood spice, sweet malt and chocolate, and a finish that’s sweet, light, and quite refreshing and inviting. Lives up to the Charbay hype!",Lew Bryson,Spring 2014
90,Convalmore 36 year old,58.0,Single Malt Scotch,936,"The last official Convalmore remains one of my top whiskies. Here is a different meditation on age. There’s soft leather, coal smoke, and polished brass. The distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel, the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. Amazingly, in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. Everything glows, the wax returns, and then, with the smoke increasing, the light fades. Old, and fascinating.<i> </i><i>(2,980 bottles)</i>",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
90,Abraham Bowman Gingerbread Beer Finished Bourbon 7 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Aged, then finished, in Bowman barrels that held Hardywood Park brewery gingerbread stout in between. A beautifully spicy bourbon—but not aggressively so—with cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. The spice is presented on a bed of layered sweetness (vanilla, caramel, and soft maple syrup), rounded out by subtle candied fruit and nuts. Nicely rounded, fun and easy to drink. One of my favorites so far from Bowman.",John Hansell,Spring 2014
90,Stauning Peated Whisky 2nd Edition,55.0,Danish,164,"A star is born. Stauning is a fledgling Danish distillery whose whiskies are 4 years old. Much as I support new world whiskies, many of them are works in progress. This is, though, the most exciting release since Glann ar Mor of France hit the scene. It&#039;s very peaty, rich, fruity, and full, and it&#039;s nearly flawless, with few indicators of its youth. This is hard to find, but make a note to snap up the third edition. 895 Krone/500 ml",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
90,Compass Box Delilah's,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,65,"A special bottling in recognition of Chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue Delilah's, and like that venue this is full of character, color, grit, and determination. It's sweet but never cloying, soft and honeyed but gutsy, and there are peppermint, licorice, and fresh hay notes in the mix, too. It's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. A departure for Compass Box, but a healthy one.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
90,The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #9),,Single Malt Scotch,250,"This latest installment of the Tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old, mature Balvenie, where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas; actually more like metheglin, as there’s an herbal, spiced element. Its textural richness means it is best with water on the side, allowing deep earthy, licorice, and cigar ash tones to develop, along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin. <i>(U.S. only.)</i>",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
90,Bowmore Devil’s Casks 10 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Matured in first-fill sherry casks, here we have Bowmore at its ballsiest, with massively bold notes of prune, dried fig, salted treacle, toffee, shoe leather, rose petal, and savory maritime edges that glance toward Marmite, all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. The palate has retained sweetness, mixing black cherry, pipe tobacco, and cloves. Powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains Bowmore identity, adds richness, ups the peatiness, and leaves you under Satan’s spell.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
90,Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2007 6 year old,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Using barley grown on Rockside Farm, this is fresh, sweet (agave syrup), delicate, and lightly buttery, with touches of lily of the valley and lemon sponge cake mix. The cereal character is restrained, with a charred hint on the palate along with banana, mandarin, cassia, and pink marshmallows (untoasted). The Laddie’s floral notes emerge late, and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. A classy young whisky. £45",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
90,Glenrothes Minister’s Reserve,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,188,"The oldest of a new three-strong range from Glenrothes called the Manse Brae series; the youngest component here is 21 years old. Serious and lightly meaty, the savory characters come at you, mixing gun smoke with cypress, sandalwood, dark chocolate, and dunnage warehouse. The headiness of moist forest floor continues on the tongue along with a burst of honeyed peach. Moving in many directions simultaneously…and slowly. Keep this neat. Classic Rothes. <i>(Travel Retail exclusive.) </i>€140",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
90,Adelphi (distilled at Mortlach) 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,157,"Rich amber in hue, sweet, and mellow with initial <i>amontillado</i> sherry notes that give way to Mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune, apricot, and gravy juices. This elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus, sultana, and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. Everything mellowed by time and oak. Very good indeed. £99",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
90,St. George’s Chapter 13,49.0,Single Malt English Whisky,109,"In the UK, Trick or Treat is still linked to Halloween and all things spooky. So this unlucky 13 is at 49% (4+9) and is priced in British pounds at £66.60. It just happens to be the best thing the distillery has done so far. The extra strength, lots of honeycomb sweetness, and a big hit of peat make this a coming of age whisky, with no immaturity and bags of great flavors. £67",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
90,Nikka Coffey Malt single cask 1998,57.0,Japanese,210,"A rarely-seen cult whisky made by distilling a 100% malted barley mash in a Coffey still and, in this expression, then aged in a remade hogshead. This is firm and complex on the nose with vanilla pod, crème caramel, and ripe banana. The palate manages to balance the silky depths and unctuous flow with nutmeg and a light cereal grip. Grain, malt, or something else? Who cares? Just seek it out. €155",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
90,Millstone PX,46.0,Dutch,102,"This is from Dutch distiller Zuidam and it&#039;s the third exceptional bottling in a row. The PX here refers to the <i>Pedro Ximenez </i>cask used in maturation and this is almost liqueur-like, with plummy fruits, gooseberry, damson jam, and overripe plum. But there&#039;s lots going on here on top, with a dusting of cocoa, some perfumey notes, and a sniff of pepper. The jam keeps fighting back though, and there&#039;s apricot in there at the end. €75",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
90,Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Barley Whiskey,50.0,Canadian,79,"Straight, 100% unmalted barley whiskey. This must be a first in modern times. The huge nose gushes unusual aromas of fresh-turned earth, wet corn cobs, sour green apples, anise, cilantro, and dill. An herbal nose becomes an herbal palate bathed in soft <i>crème brûlée</i> and hot, peppery spices. Earthy notes turn pleasantly musty, like damp straw. Finishes long on Scottish porridge. Like all Masterson’s, this barley whiskey is from Alberta Distillers. And yes, Canadian whiskey with an “e.”",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
90,Blue Hanger 9th Release,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,115,"You have to take your hat off to Berry Bros. &amp; Rudd’s Doug McIvor, who is whisky's answer to Bruce Springsteen: consistently brilliant, complex, spanning the generations, and in the form of his life. This just doesn't let up, with plenty of smoke and peat in the mix, but with citrus fruits, some plummy depths, and a vanilla cushion. It’s balanced perfectly. Born to run? You betcha.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
90,Teeling Gold Reserve 26 year old,46.0,Irish,500,"Very limited and therefore at the top end of the price range. Distiller Alex Chasko says that every time he tastes it he's taken back in time to R.E.M.'s “Green” tour, so what's not to love? Dried apple dustiness gives way to pineapple, melon, and kiwifruit. It's all very sweet until late on, when spice cuts in.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
90,Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"An elegant bourbon, and very drinkable too! Its flavors are clean and tight, with bright fruit (nectarine, tangerine,

pineapple), soft coconut, honeyed vanilla, cotton candy, and subtle gin botanicals. Polished leather and a hint of dark chocolate on the finish. Great anytime. <i>(Exclusive to Capital City Package.)</i>",John Hansell,Fall 2013
90,Glen Grant Five Decades,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,177,"Created by Dennis Malcolm to celebrate his half century at Glen Grant, this uses casks

from each of his five decades. Pale it may be, but this is no dainty little

thing. There’s lots of buttery oak before classic Glen Grant lift and energy

emerge: green apple, fruit blossom, William pear, and yellow fruits; lemon

butter icing and nettles with water. The palate is vibrant and energetic, but

holds to the middle of the tongue. A suitably celebratory dram.

Congratulations! <b>£115</b>",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
90,Mackmyra Special No. 9,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,,"Mackmyra continues to play a far more sophisticated game than it is given credit for, releasing pleasant and easy drinking mainstream malts, and then packing a punch with one-off oddball single casks. So this is an utter delight and among the very best Mackmyras released. Vanilla, banana, sweet jellybeans, and some toffee all playing Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll pops up with earthy salt notes. Medical gauze and pepper for a savory finale.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2013
90,Glen Garioch Cask #992 14 year old 1998,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Quite fragrant, with a thick, oily texture. Sweet notes (vanilla, sticky toffee), ripe barley, earthy peat, licorice root, and a hint of melon and citrus. Very clean and characterful. A lot of fun to drink. Nicely done! I can’t imagine a 14 year old Glen Garioch tasting any better than this. (A Julio’s Liquor Exclusive) ",John Hansell,Summer 2013
90,Cutty Sark Prohibition,50.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"The Real McCoy! It's said that during Prohibition Bill McCoy serviced the better speakeasies with proper Cutty Sark; hence the name. If this is a recreation of what they might have been drinking back then, you can see why they kept fighting over it. This is another bold, earthy, smoky blend with oily, industrial notes. There's crabapple, smoke, bitter lemon, grapefruit, and even black currant. It would seem blended whisky is where it's at right now! Great stuff.  ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
90,Kavalan Podium,46.0,Taiwanese Whisky,,"The mark of a good distillery is consistently producing 85 points-plus whiskies, and with this batch Kavalan's going into double digits. If the distillery has a weakness, it's that sometimes it overstates its case and makes even the Aussies look subtle and nuanced. Not here. This is a delicious dessert whisky, with vanilla and toffee in abundance and some sugar candy. But having made its case, it steps back and is surprisingly gentle. Kavalan with subtlety? Scary! ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
90,Angel&#039;s Envy Rye,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The folks at Angel’s Envy once again push the envelope with this 95% rye whiskey finished in Caribbean rum casks. Vibrant, spicy rye notes (cinnamon and mint) are tamed by rich maple syrup, graham cracker crust, nutty toffee, candy floss, subtle tropical fruit, and creamy vanilla. Warm, spicy, rummy finish. This is a mood whiskey—not one I would drink every day—but the flavors marry nicely and the sweetness tames this high-testosterone rye whiskey. Bonus points for uniqueness. <em>Editor&#039;s Choice</em>",John Hansell,Summer 2013
90,Santis Appenzeller Cask Strength Peated,52.0,Swiss,,"Two years ago I included this at a London whisky and music festival for 1,000 cool and trendy young music fans. This was the star of the show. When it says “peated,” it means sooty, charcoal-like church incense, with smoked meats and salami. It's intense, unforgettable, and not unlike a big smoky Swiss cheese. Up there with Balcones and Corsair, IMHO (that’s “In My Humble Opinion.” I'm down with the kids, you see). €55",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
90,Breckenridge Bourbon,43.0,Craft Whiskey,,"WHACK! The spicy smack of the nose sends me to check the mashbill; sure enough, this is 38% rye. The nose fumes with youthful zest: cinnamon, bright mint, sun-warmed green grass. Pour some on the palate for more explosive entertainment; sweet cinnamon red-hots burst, corn pops, and the oak burns on into the rye-high finish. This is one excitable boy of a bourbon, and it’s got me humming along. Impressive. ",Lew Bryson,Summer 2013
90,Jura 1977 Vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,900,"This vintage expression from Jura has been matured in three first-fill bourbon casks and then finished for one year in a ruby port pipe. Just 498 bottles have been released. Apricots, pineapple, caramel, butterscotch, sultanas, and white chocolate on the nose. The palate is warm and spicy, with subtle pine and citrus fruits, along with coconut and a hint of peat. Long in the finish with more vanilla before dried fruits and oak kick in. The delicate peat remains.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2013
90,Forty Creek Port Wood Reserve 2012 Edition,45.0,Canadian,,"Opinion is seriously divided on whether this or an earlier Port Wood edition is the best thing ever to come from John K. Hall’s Forty Creek distillery in Grimsby, Ontario. A winemaker, Hall used his own port barrels to finish a mature blend of barley, corn, and rye whiskies. Stewed prunes, butterscotch, and licorice rule the nose, while the palate broadens into savory herbs, spiced fruit, sweet pipe tobacco, and hints of, yes, gunpowder. C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
90,Adelphi 12 year old 2000 vintage  (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,92,"There’s a fascinating journey taking place here. The nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits, coffee cake, a spent fire in the grate, and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. The palate, however, places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray, deck and engine oil, worn leather upholstery. It seems way more mature than 12 years. The intensity is lost with water, but you gain more smoke. A great bottling.  ",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
90,Glenmorangie Ealanta Private Edition,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,119,"Ealanta is the fourth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series, and has been aged in heavily-charred virgin white oak casks from Missouri for nineteen years. The result is a nose of American cream soda, milk chocolate, fudge, pineapple, and honey; spicy and creamy. Silky smooth in the mouth, with brittle toffee and orange notes; gently herbal, with a suggestion of cloves and newly-sawn wood. Long in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, aniseed, and an enduring spicy creaminess.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
90,Adelphi 14 year old 1997 (distilled at Macallan),,Single Malt Scotch,117,"Here is Macallan in full-blown masculine mode. Initially it seems tight and (sherry) cask driven, but soon you are taken into a winter kitchen with scents of venison, and appropriate rowanberry edges adding a sweet and sour fruitiness. That wild berry note is given another nudge by a whiff of burning juniper. The palate shows it to be thick with a quivering mass of black fruits, and a finish of molasses and licorice. A feast. £75",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
90,The Macallan Ruby,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,187,"Rooted in the earth and redolent of late autumn. There’s a plummy thread that runs through this range; here we’ve gone to prune, mixed with dried cherries, and a sweet/savory edge whose whiff of heavy rose petal is reminiscent of Barolo. Robust, yet sweet. Heady, like chocolate-covered Turkish Delight. The palate has oloroso notes alongside Assam-like tannins. One to have with water on the side. Classical in structure and aromatics, but that vinous sweetness is new. £120",Dave Broom,Spring 2013
90,Penderyn Swansea City Single Cask,,Welsh Whisky,,"Penderyn quotes a respected writer on its website, saying that no one does port-influenced whisky better. This bottling certainly makes the claim. It was a single cask, but there have been others equally as impressive, and there will be more. This is brash, colorful, unsubtle, and a bit daft — so was comedian Tommy Cooper — but still unforgettable and easy to fall in love with.  256 bottles.  £146",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
90,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Small Batch Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"If you wondered when you saw “50%,” this is indeed bottled in bond whiskey, with all the requirements that go with it. The nose is just this side of hot and brings parched corn, sawn maple wood, spicy hard candy, and dry spearmint leaf. Bright and spicy on the tongue; more candy and honey, and hints of teaberry and licorice that develop into the finish. A better package of flavor and price than the earlier Taylor releases; quite enjoyable.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
90,St. George XXX Anniversary Malt,46.0,Craft Whiskey,,"Some of the oldest American malt whiskey joins this 30th anniversary mingling, finished in a pear eau de vie barrel, a nod to the distillery’s origins. The nose is elegant, deep, and clearly touched by the pear and oak. There’s creaminess in the mouth, a perfect weight, rich nutty sweetness balanced by wood; it all slides into a warming finish, and pear is all around. A bit too much pear, actually; though I love pears, that’s my one complaint.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2013
90,Canadian Rockies 21 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"A delicate dusting of exotic fruits and fragrant flower blossoms tailors this otherwise robust all-corn whisky to the Asian palate. Long development in the glass and in the mouth is typical of whisky that has spent many years in once-used barrels. East meets west as mellow oak caramels, pithy dragonfruit, and sour-sweet passion fruit temper fresh-cut red cedar, fragrant lilacs, bitter-sweet citrus fruit, and scorching white pepper. Rich and mouth coating, it fades slowly to sweetness. (Taiwan only) T$2,035",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
90,The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #5),,Single Malt Scotch,250,"So soon? This latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casks—four butts, five hoggies—from between 1966 and 1990. Hugely complex and obviously mature, it is one to sit and smell forever. Marzipan, mocha, pain au chocolat, manuka honey; every sniff reveals another aroma. It opens into cigar, sandalwood, citrus, and ripe black fruits. The palate is equally layered and expansive. It takes water, but only a drop, for that density is all-important.",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
90,The Dalmore Ceti 30 year old,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The Dalmore spirit that comprises Ceti comes from a mix of bourbon and sherry casks, with bourbon wood predominating. 23 years of maturation in American oak were followed by seven years in 30 year old Gonzalez Byass Matusalem oloroso sherry butts. The result is a nose of old leather, hessian, sandalwood, vanilla, plain chocolate, and ripe Jaffa oranges. Very full-bodied, with burnt orange, pineapple, and sticky toffee, while the finish offers ginger, orange wine gums, and old oak. 1,000 bottles. £1,250",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
90,Belgian Owl Cask L170711 4 year old 2012,46.0,Belgian Whisky,,"Belgian whisky maker Etienne Boullion takes help and advice from Bruichladdich distiller Jim McEwan, and it shows. Now the owner of the old Caperdonich stills and set for major expansion, Belgian Owl is literally on the move. Let's hope it retains the greatness of this malt. This is the distillery's best offering yet: a sweet, rich, vanilla-laced fruity dessert whisky that is both refreshing and very more-ish. Alcoholic tinned fruits, particularly pear. ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
90,Kornog Toal Esa Z,,French Whisky,77,"Kornog is the peated version of Glann ar Mor and the whisky is released in batches. This one is the most intense, with oily, charcoally peat most evident. But what makes this whisky particularly special is a dark chocolate and lime candy heart, the concentrated pear notes, and a refreshing sweet theme that holds off the oil and smoke elsewhere. Think Connemara and you&#039;re not far off. €60",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
90,Yamazaki Mizunara,48.0,Japanese,398,"Mizunara—or Japanese oak—was considered inferior for many years. Only recently have its extraordinary aromatic qualities been appreciated. These are immediately apparent on the nose: aloes, wood incense, sandalwood, cinnamon balls, sour cherry, and apple, becoming more gingery with water. Intense and acidic in the mouth, there are tart, stewed red fruits, pomegranate, and citrus. Lightly bitter tannins add to the complexity, as does the smoke rising from the smoldering incense stick. The most significant Japanese whisky of the year?  £250",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
90,Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke 60,60.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Does it do exactly what it says on the tin? You betcha! This is big, and it's smoky, and if you're a fan of Islay malts, then it's right up your street. There's more to it than just smoke, though. There's stewed apple on the nose as well as steam engine oil, and on the palate there's gooseberry, spearmint, and apple pip. But as you'd expect, the peat lingers. ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
90,Douglas Laing Big Peat,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price, I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet, with Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and Bowmore the main components, although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expect—and it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
90,Willett Single Barrel Cask No. 2504 9 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Very graceful, with a nice balance of youth and maturity. Gently sweet notes of toffee, fig, nougat, and maple syrup, spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Dark berried fruit and a hint of coconut round out the palate. Perilously more-ish bourbon with a very easy-going demeanor. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",John Hansell,Fall 2012
90,Caol Ila 12 year old Feis Ile bottling 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Often overshadowed by other noisier neighbors, it is time to reconsider Caol Ila—and this is a fine place to start. Coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab, ham with cider glaze, and teasing maritime smoke. The palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil, allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. Superlative balance. Find one of those 620 bottles! £85	",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
90,The Dalmore 1979 33 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This expression of The Dalmore Constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, with no additional finishing. The result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears, honey, and vanilla. Full-bodied, rich, sweet, elegant, yet substantial on the palate, with pineapples and fudge. Oak and aniseed slowly build, but the wood is held at bay. Long and warming in the finish, with soft spices. Barely drying. Cask number 594; 199 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
90,Clan Denny Islay,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"It's not made clear which Islay malts are included in this blended malt, but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. This successfully pulls off an intense one-two, with hard hitting Islay peat and brine on the one hand, and some rich sweetness on the other, making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky. The malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. €36",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
90,Spirit of Broadside Eau de Vie de Bier,43.0,English Grain Spirit,,"This contains hops and isn't matured for at least 3 years, so in Europe it can't be classed as whisky, but it's positive proof that some of the experimentation so widespread among American craft distillers is finding its way to Europe. This might be flabby and sappy, but it's sweet and utterly charming, and there is ginger, menthol, and glacé cherry in the mix. But most of all there's tinned pear, and I LOVE tinned pear. Excellently made, too. My new guilty pleasure. £33",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
90,Jameson Select Reserve Black Barrel,40.0,Irish,,"Bright sparks, these Jameson guys. This takes all the worldwide quality and balance of the standard bottle and adds a large dollop of pot still whiskey, providing plummy, rich fruits to the mix. They may have also upped the effects of oak, too, so there's an extra depth to the whiskey. Fans of the brand will love it, and pot still whiskey fans will appreciate an affordable full-flavored blend. (Value Pick)",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
90,Royal Salute 21 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Not exactly a new whisky for the Jubilee, just a new pack, but it’s a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy, with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending. ",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
90,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1971 (Cask #3546),,Single Malt Scotch,540,"Sherry butt once more, but this is much more relaxed in its attentions — think Montgomery Clift seducing Elizabeth Taylor rather than De Niro chatting up Liza Minelli. Sweetness is the key here, gentle and slightly caramelized, with touches of molasses-like concentration and even a whiff of the top of a crème brûlée. The palate surprises with its continued freshness; apple and the distillery’s distinctive earthy richness. Great balance.£382",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
90,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1996 (Cask #1306),,Single Malt Scotch,270,"The youngest of this Family Cask selection shows Glenfarclas in a surprisingly citric light, with plenty of citrus peels — tangerine, marmalade, and orange syrup, as well as sultana, suede, wax polish (surprising in a youngish dram), and chocolate — a recurring theme here. It is almost as if all the more lifted elements in each of the previous casks have here united. Mature, but highly expressive, and a great starter. £172",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
90,Highland Park Thor 16 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Thor is the first in Highland Park’s new cask strength Valhalla Collection, with a fresh expression inspired by the Nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. Ginger, sherry, Christmas spices, wood smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lemon on the complex, confident nose. Notably spicy in the mouth, with peaches, clotted cream, sherry, and more smoke. Long in the finish, with lots of ginger, a little aniseed, and finally, spicy peat.  ",Gavin Smith,Summer 2012
90,Talisker 10 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker’s smoke, which ain&#039;t as all-pervading as Lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
90,Penderyn Portwood Batch 2,41.0,Welsh Whisky,,"Penderyn will miss distiller Gillian MacDonald, who has gone to work at Glenmorangie, because it has been moving up the gears of late. This is a traveling circus of a whisky, with all sorts of oral treats to keep you entertained. It's not for the faint-hearted. There are rich stewed fruits, baked apple, blueberries, and spirit-soaked black and red berries all delivered with a power punch. Great. £30",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
90,Kavalan King Car Conductor,46.0,Taiwanese Whisky,100,"King Car is the name of the Taiwanese company that owns the Kavalan brand and this lavishly packaged single malt is its standard bearer. It&#039;s not hard to see why. More subtle and complex than some earlier bottlings of Kavalan, this has an exotic fruit, cream toffee, and soft banana nose, and has bitter orange, dark chocolate, and pepper on the palate. It&#039;s rapier-sharp, clean, and drying rather than sweet. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
90,Bakery Hill Double Wood Malt,46.0,Australian Whisky,,"This is the distillery's flagship brand and it's up there with anything New World whisky has to offer. The nose is subtle, with plum and peach; on the palate there are chewy orange and other citrus notes, honey, coconut, and caramel. The finish is sweet and rounded. A delicate and sophisticated whisky that reflects the rise and rise of this distillery. A$88",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
90,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Warehouse C Tornado Surviving,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The third Taylor release, and the gentlest, most even-keeled of the three. Black raspberry, mulberry, maple syrup, oak resin, dates, soft leather, and spice (mint, cinnamon, clove, vanilla) round out the palate. Very drinkable for 100 proof, and with plenty of character.",John Hansell,Summer 2012
90,Compass Box Last Vatted Malt,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"Not Compass Box at the very top of its game, but pretty damn good nevertheless. This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it, combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich, fruity, sherried whisky. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark, and I have to declare an interest — I adore this combination when it's delivered right. £180 ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
90,Glen Garioch 1986,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This latest vintage release from Glen Garioch is a cask strength 25 year old. It follows on from previous ‘small-batch’ 1978, 1990, 1991, and 1994 vintages. Peaches and ginger on the nose, with fudge and a wisp of smoke. Mildly herbal. Full-bodied, rich, and sweet in the mouth. Fresh fruit and violet creams. Finally a slightly earthy, peaty note. The finish is long and gently smoky. Robust, yet refined.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
90,Highland Park 12 Year Old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
90,"Abraham Bowman Pioneer Spirit Virginia Whiskey (distilled 1993, bottled 2011)",,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Distilled at Buffalo Trace in Kentucky but aged mostly in Virginia at the A. Smith Bowman distillery. This is a bold, hearty bourbon: not elegant or refined, rather a bit mean and moody at times. Sweeter, gentler notes of vanilla, caramel, nougat, mocha, and candied fruit wrestle with more aggressive tobacco, leather, and damp forest floor notes. Warming, cinnamon-tinged, gripping finish. A rewarding whiskey for those with an adventurous soul.",John Hansell,Spring 2012
90,Hakushu 18 year old,,Japanese,,"Unlike their colleagues in Scotland, Japanese distillers do not exchange stock for their blending requirements. This means that each distillery is set up to produce a wide range of styles. Hakushu uses four different types of malt (unpeated to heavy) run through four pairs of differently-shaped stills. Each single malt is a different blend of these bases. While still herbal, this example shows more sherried notes along with sour orange zest, tropical fruit, and some smoke. Complex.£105",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
90,Hakushu 25 year old,43.0,Japanese,,"As the price may suggest, there ain’t a lot of this around, but to see Hakushu at its most robust, try and find a bar with a bottle. Again, the sherry component has been upped, as has the smoked element. There is, however, always that graceful Hakushu purity running through, this time expressed as rhubarb and strawberry. The palate shows great oily depth, hints of walnut, and yes, a sprig of mint tying it to the 10 year old. £555",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
90,Drambuie,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Intriguing herbal/medicinal nose, with notes of pepper, grass, dried hay, dried flowers, orange peel, and licorice. Sweet but lively and light on the palate, as the orange explodes and the whisky boldly appears, wrapped in honey and herbs. The finish is herbal and sweet as the whisky strolls off into the distance. Overall, quite complex and rewarding.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
90,Johnnie Walker Double Black,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"So how brave can you be? Would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? If you've got a whisky maker as good as Jim Beveridge, then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it, doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple, orange, and fruit content too. Great. ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
90,Bruichladdich 10 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The first 10 year old distilled by the current owners back in 2001. Lovely marriage of both bourbon and sherry casks, and quite fresh, with a maturity resembling a 12 year old, rather than 10. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable, with creamy vanilla, honeycomb, banana bread, bright lemon, melon (honeydew, cantaloupe), tangerine, candied ginger, and delicate brine. With all the Bruichladdich razzle-dazzle over the past decade, we can embrace this unpretentiously delicious Laddie with open arms. ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
90,Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Glen Grant) 1972 37 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is quite different from the Adelphi Glen Grant bottling (below), being more cask-driven, but Glen Grant’s clean fruitiness remains, although transformed by age. Its apples are baked, with some added caramelized juices thrown in; we see apricot alongside dried lemon peel, and light, sweet spice. The waxiness here is akin to leather oil, while the oak has sufficient grip to give structure. In time, there are hints of the cellar — burlap and wet earth. Delicious, and best neat. £184",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
90,Glenglassaugh 35 Year Old The Chosen Few,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The initial release in Glenglassaugh’s new ‘The Chosen Few’ range has been picked by customer accounts manager Ronnie Routledge. It was distilled in 1976 and matured in an ex-sherry butt that yielded 654 bottles. Initially, an aroma of Black Twist tobacco and treacle, with sweeter and more floral notes following on. Significant honey influence. Mouth-coating, with sweet sherry and tropical fruits, plus developing honey and spice notes. Oak, toast, and dark chocolate in the lingering, lively finish. £300",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
90,Duncan Taylor Peerless (distilled at Glenrothes) 1969 41 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Immediately you can tell this is a complex, old, mature whisky — that hint of rancio is there, but there’s more of a beeswax character than on the Adelphi bottling (below), along with the peachiness that often appears in old drams. This is balanced by light coconut, even a hint of grist. The waxiness seen on the nose allows it to cling to the tongue, while the fruits become jellied. Benefits from a drop of water, allowing lemon and vanilla to show. £210",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
90,Gordon & MacPhail 41 year old 1970 (distilled at Macallan),43.0,Single Malt Scotch,700,"On more familiar ground with this G&amp;M bottling of one of Speyside’s most iconic single malts, this is Macallan in full-on sherried form. Highly aromatic with powdered clove, hints of incense and fig, behind which is cacao, Bolivar cigar, and molasses. The palate has immediate smoke and surprisingly gentle tannins — the inherent oiliness of the spirit keeping any grip at bay. Very long, leathery, prune-like (think armagnac), and dense. A classic after-dinner mouth-filler.",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
90,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Springbank) 13 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Recently bottled by Duncan Taylor in their non-colored, non-chill filtered NC2 range, this 13 year old expression of Springbank initially exhibits tinned pears on the nose, then smoked fish cooked in butter, coconut oil, brine, and a hint of lemon. More sweet wood smoke with time, turning to char. The palate opens with profound, sweet fruit, swiftly followed by salt, lime, and medicinal notes. Lingering, with ginger in the pleasantly oaky finish. £64",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
90,Benromach 30 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"We had some new Benromachs from Gordon & MacPhail last issue that illustrated what the firm has been up to since it purchased the site in 1992. This release comes from its previous incarnation as part of DCL. The elegant, mature nose shows an ‘Old Speyside’ light smokiness alongside barley, cacao, cigar humidor, and potpourri. The palate is gentle and unctuous with some sherried touches, while the smoke reruns on the very end. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
90,Strathisla 16 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is one of a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.



My pick of this batch. Strathisla’s a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It’s a hard to pin down malt, and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. £37",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
90,"Berry Bros. & Rudd, distilled at Balmenach",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Although one of the old Speyside crew (along with Mortlach, Glenfarclas, and Macallan) Balmenach has, inexplicably in my mind, never even achieved cult status. It has simply kept on making rich, powerful, worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. This rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well, but also walnut and sultana. The palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
90,"Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection “Rediscovered Barrels,” 1993 vintage",,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Richly flavored and surprisingly sweet on the nose and front of the palate. A tactile whiskey: creamy, yet becoming resinous toward the finish. Notes of vanilla saltwater taffy, roasted nuts, tobacco, and molasses. An intriguing whiskey, and my favorite of the three.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
90,Four Roses 12 year old Limited Edition Single Barrel (2011 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Very floral and fragrant. Gently sweet, too: apple tart laced with cinnamon, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup.  Well-defined oak and crisp, dry spice (cinnamon, anise, cocoa, nutmeg) balance the sweetness. An interesting whiskey: big in some ways, yet elegant in others",John Hansell,Summer 2011
90,Gordon & MacPhail Generations: Glenlivet 70 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"You would expect any 70 year old whisky to be crepuscular, dense, and wooded. Not here. The nose is amazingly fresh — distillery character fully intact — with layers of rancio and heavy florals. In time, there’s candle wax, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather, even the whiff of a soft mink stole. Concentrated and complex. The palate is like an ancient vin santo with oxidized nuttiness, quince and medlar, and subtle peat. Hugely expressive on the palate, with a sweet finish. Truly remarkable.",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
90,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1963,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. A first-fill American oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint. The effect is like a grown up 1991. The maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. Gentle and clean, and again not one to dilute. £750",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
90,"Penderyn Bourbon single cask, cask strength",,Welsh Whisky,,"The unusual distilling process and some maturation in Madeira casks has given standard Penderyn a liqueur-like, perfumey quality many whisky fans don’t care for. This is a single bourbon cask bottling of the 11th cask the distillery ever filled, to mark its 10th anniversary, and is less cloying, less feminine, and more gutsy than the standard version. It’s also very palatable and of excellent quality. Some will make it to America, but the price tag will deter all but the most passionate. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
90,Kilbeggan 18 year old,40.0,Irish,130,"Kilbeggan, once overshadowed by its stable-mates, is the rising star in the Cooley repertoire; an active distillery once more and capable of thoroughbred gems like this. This isn’t your typical Irish whiskey at all, so be warned. Sure there are lashings of soft caramel, peach crumble, and vanilla up front, but then the wood takes over and big waves of tannin and chili pepper kick in. It’s 40% ABV but it delivers a much harder punch. Limited edition release.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
90,Kavalan Solist Fino Cask Strength,,Taiwanese Whisky,,"If you didn’t know what it was, you’d swear this was an old and venerable big sherried whisky, and it takes some accepting that it’s still a kitten. The clues are there: hints of immature green fruit and reedy barley, and the finish is sweet and soft, with none of the astringency of an old wood-influenced malt. But it tastes wonderful: rich, sweet, and grapey, with gooey plums and juicy raisins. A sprinkling of pepper dust reins everything in perfectly. €155 Currently not available in the U.S. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
90,Fettercairn Fior,42.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Released with no age statement, Fettercairn Fior contains 15 percent heavily-peated whisky matured in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels, along with a proportion of 14 and 15 year old spirit. The result is a bold and complex whisky with real nose presence; smoke, sherry, toffee, vanilla, and oranges merge on the nose, while the palate showcases more smoke and toffee, plus spices, oak, and licorice in the lengthy finish. £36 Not currently available in the U.S.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
90,Port Charlotte PC7 7 year old (Cask #1215),,Single Malt Scotch,120,"A single cask from the distillery’s peated “Port Charlotte” line of whiskies. Well behaved for such youth. Nice honeyed malt and soft caramel base with good viscosity as a bed for tarry peat, licorice stick, freshly-ground pepper, and cocoa, along with a kiss of sauternes, delicate pit fruit, smoked seaweed, and a lingering coastal accent. Long, warming finish. (<em>Park Avenue Liquor exclusive</em>)",John Hansell,Summer 2011
90,Knappogue Castle Twin Wood 16 year old,40.0,Irish Single Malt,100,"The latest limited release from this brand. This whiskey spent most of its life aging in a bourbon barrel and then spent 9 months in sherry casks. (“Twin wood” is synonymous with “finishing.”) This one’s triple distilled (think Bushmills distillery) and is the first Knappogue Castle to be aged in two types of wood. It’s a very nice whiskey, with an array of bright fruit lying on a bed of creamy vanilla, toasted nuts, marshmallow, marzipan, and powdered cocoa. Excluding the original 1951 Knappogue Castle release (from the long gone B. Daly distillery), this is my favorite of the “modern day” Knappogue Castle whiskeys.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
90,"A. D. Rattray 18 year old (Cask #2075, distilled at Bowmore)",,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The fruit (orange marmalade, tangerine, fresh pineapple) is nearly as dominant as the leafy smoke. Sweet notes of nutty caramel, honeyed barley, toffee, and nougat round out the palate. Ginger, cinnamon, telicherry pepper, tobacco, and ash play a supporting role. Lingering fruity, smoky finish. For those who like sherried Islay whiskies.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
90,Glenglassaugh,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A polished whisky, light-medium in body with well-rounded flavors. Fruity (ripe orange, lemon gumdrops, candy apple), with creamy vanilla and a honeyed, toasted malt foundation. Soft, gentle oak throughout. What a lovely, gentle-natured whisky, straight down the middle! Bonus points for versatility. ",John Hansell,Spring 2011
90,Glengoyne Christmas Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Credit to Glengoyne for coming up with something different. There are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year, with a further 100 or so released each Christmas from the same cask each year until 2014, effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. Better still, this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery.

The name is spot on; it really is Christmas in a glass, with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater, flowers, candy stick, and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. Dark chocolate, cherry, orange, and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. Some special bottlings from Glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur, but not this one. This is clean, pure, and classy. Can’t wait to see where it goes next.

",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
90,The Macallan Easter Elchies,,Single Malt Scotch,185,"This is like a blast from the past, with much in common with the sherried Cask Strength of old, and a welcome treat for any fan of the big, sherried Macallans. All the red berry and blood orange notes are present on the nose, along with cocoa and a dusty smokiness. The palate is full, velvety and chewy, with Christmas cake, oranges, and some nuttiness. Nutmeg and cinnamon fill out the mouth feel, before a long and classic sherried finish.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
90,Talisker 30 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"For me, Talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. This, however, immediately shows promise. Gold in color, and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation. 

As with many of these older whiskies, water isn’t the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker’s heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.

The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer. ",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
90,High West Double Rye,46.0,Rye Whiskey,35,"A blend of two straight whiskeys: a very young 2 year old high rye content whiskey and a 16 year old rye whiskey with a lower rye content. Perhaps the spiciest American whiskey I have ever tasted, yet at the same time, quite tame and mellow. Complex notes of mint, clove, cinnamon, licorice root, pine nuts, and dark chocolate, with a surprising dose of gin botanicals throughout. A soft underbelly of caramel, sweet corn, and soothing vanilla provides an interesting counterpoint. Very easy-drinking, too (hard to believe it’s 46%). Intriguing, and a must-try for rye whiskey aficionados — even if only to satisfy your curiosity.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
91,Forty Creek Victory,43.0,Canadian,75,"Corn and rye whiskies blended with a tad of Villard Noir Starboard wine commemorate Canada’s victory in a battle fought in the War of 1812 where Forty Creek now distills whisky. Toasted oak staves were inserted into half of the fully matured whisky for 2 months. A strong maple nose dissolves into hints of fruitiness, while a sweet palate balances and restrains drying tannins. Fruity, creamy, and mouth-filling with peppery spices. (600 bottles for U.S.)",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
91,Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 19D662),,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"Initial fruit aromas play host to a savory medicinal note, like cherry cough drops or Robitussin, hinting of the formidable flavors to come as this dense whiskey unleashes waves of black cherry soda, chewy figs, stone fruits, citrus zest, and a cascade of bright vanilla on the rolling finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
91,Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2011,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Distilled from Oxbridge and Publican barley varieties grown on six Islay farms. Lime, brine, oatmeal cookies, and custard on the nose.

91,GlenDronach 25 year old 1993 Master Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,350,"The nose is fragrant and floral, featuring ginger, hand-rolled tobacco, vanilla, hazelnuts, and ultimately, sweet sliced-apple aromas. Full-bodied in the mouth, with stewed fruits, milk chocolate, raisins, almonds, and lively spices. The finish is leisurely, with darkening milk chocolate, tannic oak, bitter tea, and persistent spiciness.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
91,Glengoyne Cask Strength (Batch No. 006),,Single Malt Scotch,80,"This was matured entirely in sherry wood. Blackcurrants, black pepper, vanilla, caramel, and fruit spices on the nose.

91,Glenmorangie 14 year old Quinta Ruban,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Orange segments sprinkled with black pepper on the nose, then spicy dark chocolate and coffee with cream. More dark chocolate and Jaffa orange on the palate, plus walnuts, almonds, and marzipan. Lengthy in the finish, with soft spices and continuing dark chocolate.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
91,Tamdhu Batch Strength (No. 004),,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Aromas of newsprint, damp foliage, and wood spice dominate on the nose. Confident, almost fizzy sherry notes on the full palate, with sultanas, figs, and fruit spices. It becomes progressively more citric. The lengthy finish produces dark chocolate dipped in chili sauce. A sherry-soaked dram.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
91,Port Askaig 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,450,"Remarkably fresh and fruity on the opening nose, then lively pineapple, mango, and peaches. Ashy woodsmoke lurks behind the fruit. Finally, brine and black pepper. Vibrant orchard fruits on the palate, with barbecue flavors that become peatier and spicier in time. Aniseed, lemon, tobacco, and tangy oak in the lengthy finish. (3,000 bottles for U.S. and Canada)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
91,Kilchoman Loch Gorm (2019 Edition),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"Sweet fruity peat, new leather, cinnamon, and ginger on the nose. Good blend of smoke and sherry on the substantial palate, with peppery red berries, dark chocolate, and peat. The long smoky finish features lively fruit spices. (1,920 bottles in U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
91,Spirit of Hven Hvenus Rye,,World Whisky,78,"Like licking caramel-drizzled mint chocolate chip ice cream; master distiller Henric Molin’s high-rye mashbill delivers a great balance between rye spices and creamy sweetness. Quite soft, with mint and caramel at first; layers of toffee and cinnamon follow, then becoming mouth-drawing as the pepper and clove spices crest a peak of intensity, tapering to toffee and cinnamon, and a dry finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
91,Kentucky Owl Confiscated Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,125,"The nose is spiced—cinnamon, allspice, clove, pepper—and rich with cooked fruit—blueberry jam, stewed plums, pomegranate molasses—as well as roasted peanuts, vanilla, and oak. In the mouth, there’s more liveliness, with Big Red gum, cherry pie, blackberry cobbler, peanuts, and cinnamon-apple coffee cake. It wraps up beautifully, with chili-chocolate, roasted nuts, and cigar end. Kentucky Owl doesn’t disclose the ages of the bourbons used in this bottling, but the balance of maturity on the nose and verve on the palate work to excellent effect.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
91,James E. Pepper Old Pepper 10 year old Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. L18V),,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Sweet confectionary aromas delight the nose with peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, chocolate wafer cookies, peanut shells, and toasted oak. It’s bright and lively on the palate, with excellent texture and balance; roasted pecans, dark chocolate, brown sugar, and tobacco leaf. Expressive fruit—grapes, cherries, blueberries, and blackberries—comes to the fore with a few drops of water, and it finishes full and rich, with pepper and baking spices, nutty chocolate, and drying oak.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
91,Barrell Cask Strength Bourbon (Batch 018),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A complex nose that starts out herbaceous and then opens to notes of saddle leather, buttered popcorn, pecans, dark cherry, orange tea, and fragrant vanilla. A rich, chewy palate offers vanilla cream pie, lemon, blackberries, corn muffin, and chocolate-covered coconut, balanced against some drying oak, an herbal note, and dried leaves. The finish is a long, balanced ride of chocolate, cinnamon, and tobacco leaf. A rich, classic bourbon.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
91,Barrell Cask Strength Bourbon (Batch 019),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A blend of 9 to 14 year old bourbons from Tennessee and Kentucky. A generous and perfumy nose of dusty spice, peanut brittle, cherry candy, orange, cola, molasses, and roasted grain.

91,Ohishi Islay Cask-Finished Rice Whisky,,Japanese,90,"Sweet honey, pears, melon, and vanilla sponge, with smoke that is both sweet and acrid and cuts through like a knife. Islay knows that delicious combination of sweetness, fruitiness, and smoke very well, and this could be amazing with a firmer, weightier texture. Flavors of watermelon, taffy, squeezed lime, and candied pineapple, with the smoke and meek spices growing in strength, adding smoked chocolate notes before a short finish. (5,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
91,Egan’s Centenary,46.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,100,"Ireland’s penchant for cognac-cask finishing continues to impress with this single malt and grain blend, which marks the centenary of the death of company namesake and Irish nationalist Henry Egan, who made tweed suits a symbol of protest. With a delicate nose of peach, passion fruit, white blossom, lime, pear, rose water, and sweet grain, the cognac flavors coddle the palate with peach, fudge, a whizz of spice, vanilla sponge, and grapefruit. (5,995 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
91,Egan’s 16 year old Legacy Reserve II,46.0,Irish Single Malt,200,"The Pyrenean dessert wine-cask finish brings citrus, candy hearts, apricot, and cooking apple peelings to the nose, with hints of aniseed, allspice, and macadamia nuts. Fizzy orange, singed peel, fruit tarts, and honey initially, though it’s pretty feisty with pepper, aniseed, and allspice. Milk chocolate, apple, and malt biscuits glide into the finish, where the spices fade but the fruit remains juicy and sweet. (1,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
91,Bardstown Bourbon Co. Fusion Series #1 Kentucky Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"This is Bardstown Bourbon’s first release using its own whiskey—60% 2 year old bourbon, along with 40% 11 year old from another Kentucky distillery.

91,W.L. Weller 12 year old Straight Bourbon,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"The nose feels dense and richly layered as cedary oak and sandalwood incense take the lead, while a deeper dive reveals toasted walnuts, licorice, and cocoa. The palate serves up plenty of sweet butterscotch, juicy grapefruit, and shaved coconut, before drying oak tannins sweep in, delivering coffee and dark chocolate cake on the finish. A supple mouthfeel and long finish enhance the overall delicious impression made by this bourbon. Shows best at full proof. <em>Best Value</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2019
91,Arran 21 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,200,"Arran’s latest addition to its core range is matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks.

91,Powers Three Swallow,,Irish Single Pot Still,48,"Rich dried fruits, candied peel, dried apricot, mango strips, white pepper, herbal notes, almond paste, and sweet grapefruit flesh—this has signature notes of Powers all over it. Thick and velvety, there’s warm marmalade, sugared almonds, golden barley, citrus, and green apple. It’s all quite mellow until the spices work themselves up into a bit of a frenzy. Long fruity finish, with toasted coconut and a luscious, billowing spiciness.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
91,Grand MacNish Double Matured 15 year old Sherry Cask Finish,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,55,"Rather luxurious aromas of orange peel, walnut, stewed fruits, fleshy plum, peach pit, sherry fruit, gentle oak, and wood spices. Spiced marmalade, dark Seville orange, plum, vanilla, and plump raisin; this lays down a rich blanket of flavor, though it’s slit open by a piercing blade of spice.

91,Shelter Point 100% Rye,,Canadian,93,"Before a regulation required British Columbia distillers to source their ingredients within the province, Shelter Point bought some 100% rye spirit from Alberta Distillers. Nine years later, it has developed flavors of halvah and honey, which caress blue clay, turning it sweet, floral, and fruity, then hot and spicy, with cloves, rose water, and more rye spices.

91,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2018 Release),62.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"This begins with a big scoop of banana pudding, or maybe it’s banana cream pie, since there is a lively dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Toasted marshmallows, pound cake, crème brûlée, cinnamon Red Hots, and earthiness on the nose; water brings out candied pineapple.

Over time, more oak and nuttiness emerge, wafting into a gentle burnt marshmallow and toasted-walnut finish. 1,083 bottles",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
91,Duncan Taylor Dimensions (distilled at Cambus) 1991 26 year old,,Single Grain Scotch,215,"Waxy lemon, light honey, lychee, physalis, fresh hay, and the slightly tart aroma of ripening pear.

91,Mortlach 16 year old Distiller’s Dram,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"One of three Mortlachs introduced in 2018, this has much to live up to, as the classic Flora &amp; Fauna Mortlach was also 16 years old.

Quite full-bodied, with toffee apples, gammon, and old leather on the palate. Cocoa powder and tinned peaches in the finish. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
91,High West Double Rye! (Batch 18A23),46.0,Rye Whiskey,35,"High West made a momentous change to its recipe for Double Rye! this year, for the first time adding its own house-made pot still rye to a blend that was previously fully sourced from other distilleries. Apple blossom, yuzu, chamomile tea, walnut shells, pine boughs, and green-apple candy on the nose shift into an oily palate that starts off soft and then picks up speed and spice. Flavors of lemon, black pepper, walnut-and-apple chutney, dark chocolate, and a lively hit of green apple make this a satisfying pour—especially at the price. Above all, it validates High West’s skill as both blenders and distillers in their own right. <em><a href=""/top20/2018/14-high-west-double-rye-batch-18a23/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 14 in the 2018 Top 20</a> </em>

Plunge into a pool of honey, orange, mango, vanilla, and sugary-sweet candy, shot through with little darts of spice.

91,Egan’s Legacy Reserve 15 year old,46.0,Irish Single Malt,200,"There is a lot of pride behind this bottle, but undoubtedly its best features are the gloriously juicy mouthfeel and generosity of flavor. Orchard fruit, creamy vanilla, and freshly sliced orange square up to a company of spices: a mix of dried cumin, cayenne, paprika, and black pepper.

This has smoked fish, iodine, pine forests, driftwood, lemon zest, and clean medicinal qualities rather than peatiness.

This pot still whiskey from 1985 is mouth drawing with fruit flesh and skins, tasting of stewed fruits, baked orange, apple, and pomegranate, with a very fine shimmer of spices that sparkles on the tongue.

While this feels less potent than Samaroli’s other Islay offerings, it fits the mood perfectly for a nightcap. The taste buds detect orange, honey, chocolate praline, hazelnut, Oreos, a hint of cocoa, and an underbelly of peat smoke that carries into the finish.

91,Jameson Black Barrel,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,37,"Sumptuously rich and intense whiskey emerges from these double-charred casks; a seduction of butterscotch, treacle, toasted nuts, scorched coconut, raisin, and vanilla essence. Secure in its deep-centered sweetness, it revels in caramelized sugar, dark vanilla, pecan nut slice, crème brûlée, peppery spice, and fleshy fruits gloomily submerged in sticky, umber syrups.

Such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage 2010,,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The dance begins in the open barley fields, with a gust of wind catching grain’s natural aromatic presence. Then cherry blossoms and roasted pine nuts tango for dominance, just before the core notes kick in: caramel chew, malt, cornbread, brown sugar, and chocolate, followed by hints of molasses, cardamom, and gingersnaps. As the finish lingers, it’s clear that this is sippin’ whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018

So wonderfully thick and chewy that you need to resist the temptation to pick up a knife and fork. It imparts dark weighty fruit, blackened oak, cooked apple, and a twister of peppery turmoil. Add water liberally to unlock figs, dates, and plums.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Paul John) 6 year old,,Indian Whisky,130,"Definitely one to taste. The nose offers up allspice, moderate peat smoke, pomegranate, dried peel, and ground almonds. The palate is superb; milk chocolate caramels, assertive smoke, and peppercorn, then a slow, warm slide into coffee, cocoa, and licorice, becoming lush and velvety in texture. Paradoxically, the more diluted it becomes, the thicker and more substantial it seems to taste. Long finish of coffee and chocolate. (Batch 4)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018

The palate’s intense oakiness is tempered by an herbaceous sweetness and integrated spice—cinnamon, cubeb, and allspice, with chalky minerality. There’s a savory and saline quality that lingers into the finish, which is spicy and dry with oak tannins.

First Saint-Julien, then Napa; where will Green Spot take our taste buds next?",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,The Temple Bar 10 year old,40.0,Irish Single Malt,64,"Bright citrus, zested lime, grapefruit peel, crystalized fruits, malted biscuits, and oak, overlaid with dry spice notes of nutmeg and cinnamon bark. A creamy, malty palate yields to an initial spicy base layer. When the spices step aside, there is dried orange, fudge sweetness, and chocolate orange. Tangy, concentrated orange, with spices fraying from the edges completes the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,Cotswolds 2014 Odyssey Barley,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,55,"It’s quite a tick list for their first single malt: 100% locally grown floor-malted barley, long fermentations, unusual yeast strains, innovative distillation cuts, and bourbon and shave-toast-rechar red wine casks. Honey, sugar-sprinkled shortbread, peach tarts, marzipan fruits, glacé apricot, finely shredded citrus peel, and young pink rhubarb. Flavors of heather honey, chili flakes, Christmas spices, caramelized sugar, malt; then marmalade, dried red fruits, and cappuccino. A great all-rounder. More please! (960 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,The Dalmore Port Collection 1996 Vintage,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,592,"Dalmore launched a trio of vintages finished in tawny port pipes. The pick of the bunch is the oldest, distilled in 1996, which displays a confident, rich nose of raisins, mildly smoky prunes, vanilla, and blood orange. Full-bodied in the mouth, with red berry fruits, ginger, white pepper, and spicy oak. Medium-length in the finish, with coffee-soaked oak, figs, and damsons at the close. £450",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
91,Glen Scotia 18 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,113,"New for 2017, this was matured for 17 years in bourbon casks before being finished in <i>oloroso</i> sherry casks for 1 year. The nose is fragrant, with prunes, oranges, vanilla, and faint wood polish. Ultimately, ozone. Silky palate delivery, with sweet sherry, honey, and dark chocolate-coated orange fondant creams, then a note of angelica. The finish offers spicy plain chocolate and a suggestion of sea salt. £86",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
91,High West Campfire,46.0,Miscellaneous,70,"An oddball that crosses the divide between American whiskey and scotch by literally mixing the two, Campfire combines straight Indiana rye, straight Indiana bourbon, and peated blended malt scotch, marrying them together in heavily toasted French and Hungarian oak wine barrels. The scotch adds hearty, meaty flavors to the dry, spicy, and rich bourbon and rye. This is a robust and beefy whiskey, with smoke reminiscent of Southern barbecue. Earlier releases of this ambitious whiskey didn’t quite hit the mark. Now, it’s right on target. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/14-high-west-campfire/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 14 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>

91,Tyrconnell 16 year old,46.0,Irish Single Malt,100,"Most Irish whiskey consumed in the U.S. is blended, and Ireland’s single pot still whiskeys enjoy a cult following. However, Irish single malts, including Tyrconnell 16 year old, are often unfairly overshadowed by their Scottish neighbors. This limited-edition whiskey, made entirely with Irish barley, is double distilled in pot stills like most scotch, then aged in bourbon barrels. Tyrconnell is named for a racehorse, but this whiskey is slow and steady: it’s soft and gentle, yet full-flavored, with warming vanilla, graham cracker, and citrus notes, and rounded spice. Though it may not be as brash as some scotch malts, this thoroughbred is able to go the distance. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/16-tyrconnell-16-year-old/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Number 16 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Adam Polonski,Winter 2017
91,Sheep Dip Islay Blended Malt,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"Deftly blending the power and grace of popular Islay malts, this whisky offers a sizzle of bacon fat, thick clods of peat, cocoa, and breezy smoke on the nose. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma, swathes of toasted spice, sweeping malty notes, delicious chocolate, and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds formidably, until it engulfs the back of the palate. Sheep Dip whisky may have been around since the 1970s, but this latest creation maps out the best of modern Islay styles to great effect. A triumphant, approachable blend that shows great strength of purpose, yet remains full of charm. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/13-sheep-dip/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 13 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>

91,Royal Salute Special Batch 21 year old Polo Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,145,"A pedigree blend gracing your glass with aromas of sultana, prune, glacé cherry, toffee, nutmeg, dense dark fruits, sweet toffee, and cozy Christmas spices. This well-paced, silky blend canters through red apple, cherry, pomegranate, pressed date bars, Brazil nut, nutmeg, and pepper. Cinnamon, black pepper, and apple peel make for a harmonious finish. A suitably glamorous libation for spectators of the sport of kings. £110",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
91,Jura One and All,51.0,Single Malt Scotch,158,"This limited edition 20 year old assemblage was matured in bourbon barrels, sherry casks, Cabernet Franc casks, Cabernet Sauvignon casks, and Pinot Noir barriques. Rich and sweet on the nose, with marzipan, apricot jam, and fresh pineapple with vanilla custard. Silky, with ginger, cherries, and caramel on the palate. The finish is long, with black pepper, licorice, and slightly tannic oak. (5,000 bottles) £120",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
91,Rock Oyster Sherry Edition,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on, revealing mandarin, gingerbread, glazed ham, clove, seashells, and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through, while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish, until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey, this rocks.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
91,"Little Book ""The Easy",,American Blended Whiskey,80,"It opens with dark chocolate, coffee, hazelnut, leather, earth, cornbread, and maple syrup. Then it pops with brown-sugar butter melting over grits, but the iron skillet cornbread reappears with a dominating and pleasing malt note. Hints of dill, parsley, and roasted almonds come next. Toward the end, a burst of vanilla hits before a long finish with a hint of honey. As American blends go, this is a fantastic pour.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
91,Kentucky Peerless Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,125,"Delivering a buttery mouthfeel with toasted rye and baking spice notes, Peerless is the only craft producer on our list. It’s hard to pinpoint why this young rye succeeds where others fail, but one point of difference is the use of sweet mash fermentation, rather than the much more common sour mash technique, where spent mash is added to the new fermentation. Furthermore, the Peerless warehouse achieves temperatures upward of 110 degrees. Whatever the technical reasons, Peerless is paving the way and we expect more craft distillers to join them. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/15-kentucky-peerless-straight-rye/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 15 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>

91,Kentucky Peerless Straight Rye,,Craft Whiskey,125,"Peerless Distilling’s first whiskey in nearly a century; at 2 years old, it’s precocious. Captivating on the nose; fruit-driven, with orange, peach nectar melded with vanilla custard, and nice details of clove and nutmeg. The palate pours big and bold, bursting with fruit alcohol and a face slap of spicy, peppery rye. While it’s a touch hot, the reveal of 53.7% makes this forgivable. A generous splash of water unleashes more flavor, baking spice, and aniseed on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
91,Forty Creek Confederation Oak Lot 1867-I,40.0,Canadian,70,"Vague fruitiness, barrel notes, and corncobs on the nose turn to lush caramels, with a plush mouthfeel punctuated by hints of rye spices that become more assertive as notes of cloves meld into candy cane on a long, spicy, then pithy finish. There is more fruit in this special Canada 150 edition of Confederation Oak—sweet ripe apples and tart gooseberries. A masterful example of blending.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2017
91,Benromach 1975,,Single Malt Scotch,1600,"This vintage bottling was distilled during the 1970s and spent 41 years in a refill bourbon hogshead (#3434). Spicy on the early nose, with fresh oak. Increasingly malty, with ginger and apricot. The palate is rich and full, with Jaffa orange, stewed apples, cocoa, and pipe tobacco. Plain chocolate and increasingly tannic oak in the finish. Ultimately, warming spicy citrus fruits and smoky black pepper. (162 bottles) £1,250",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
91,Glen Scotia 25 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,320,"Maturation took place in refill bourbon casks before a final 12-month period in first-fill bourbon casks. Lemon, ginger, pine resin, and a hint of sea salt on the nose, then banoffee pie develops. Luscious on the palate, with subtle spice, a touch of ashy smoke, and principally big orchard fruit notes. Drying in the lengthy finish, with a wisp of smoke, brine, and peppery oak. Glen Scotia at its characterful best.£250",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
91,GlenDronach 25 year old Grandeur (batch 7),,Single Malt Scotch,850,"Matured in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks. Confident plum, prune, and raisin notes on the early nose, with developing ripe cherries, sherried fudge, and resin. A slightly earthy undertone. Viscous in the mouth—very sweet—with developing tingling spices, then darker fruit notes emerge, with licorice and plain chocolate. The finish is long, with enduring dark chocolate and fruity spice. (1,180 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2017
91,High West Campfire,46.0,Multinational Whisky,70,"This hybrid of bourbon, rye, and blended malt scotch is the dusty trail made liquid flesh. Smoke and cooked meat up front, balanced by sizzling rye spice, red fruit, and dark chocolate. Seaweed, salt spray, and peat are happy to share the spotlight. Barbecue ribs dry-rubbed with paprika, chili powder, and clove, with a smoldering finish. Hot, powerful, and beguiling. A great improvement over earlier releases (2016 batch).",Adam Polonski,Fall 2017
91,Tyrconnell 16 year old,46.0,Irish,100,"Whiskeys made from 100% Irish barley are not abundant, so at sweet sixteen, there is much to celebrate about this grown-up version of Tyrconnell. Honey, pear, crème brûlée, clementine peel, tinned peach, and pencil shavings on the nose. Citrus, candied peel, lemon, and grapefruit mingle among the sweetness, but it’s anchored by layered spices and rounds out with a finish of juicy spiced oranges and peach. Moreish and delicious.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
91,Teeling Brabazon Bottling Series 1,,Irish,92,"William Brabazon, 3<sup>rd</sup> Earl of Meath, once presided over Newmarket, the area of Dublin the Teeling Distillery now calls home. Clean lemon-ozone character, with peach, apricot, and melon, the sherry finessing the distillery character. There’s further fruitiness apparent on the palate; oaky chardonnay notes, more melon, and warm orange, though the strength burns through. Grapefruit and gooseberry sharpness keeps this zingy and fresh above a sweet toffee base. €78",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
91,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Bruichladdich) 23 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,111,"There is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. Gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper. Creamy chocolate once the spice subsides, it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. Nuts, pepper, and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
91,"Mars The Lucky Cat “Ash ’99,” 43%",,Japanese,100,"Yes, there is a cute, mewing black kitten on the label. Turkish delight, pomegranate, rose water, lemon, lime zest, clementine, and sandalwood. A syrupy texture with the sweetness of hard fruit candy; there are flavors of cooked apple, mandarin, butterscotch, melon, ginger, and chili pepper. The slow crescendo of spices is particularly impressive. The pleasantly fruity finish sees a drop-off in the spices. Distinctively aromatic and exotic.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
91,Hyde No. 2 President’s Cask 10 year old,46.0,Irish,80,"Saturated with tropical fruits, banana, butterscotch, barley sweetness, marzipan, creamed coconut, and a fine thread of spice after the 8 month finishing period in dark Caribbean rum casks. This is a huge vehicle for flavor: silky and thick mouthfeel with sweet citrus, honey, mango, guava, passion fruit, Seville orange, and a sting of bitterness to keep your taste buds on their toes. Spice is merely a bit-part player.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
91,Alexander Murray & Co. The Monumental 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,65,"Sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors, with aging tobacco leaf, walnuts, malted barley, charcoal sticks, and snuffed candle wicks, all cushioned by soft oak. An initial impression of a lighter character, though it’s bursting with juicy toffee, butterscotch sauce, wood spices, and dried banana. The spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend, leaving nutty residual flavors.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2017
91,Classic Cask 23 year old Original Cask,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,160,"This archetypal midnight dram enthralls with aromas of cedar wood humidor, blossom honey, hazelnut, vanilla pod, treacle cake, and maple syrup. Dry as leaves, save for some floaty florals. It’s less weighty than some whiskies at this age, with a balanced show of cinnamon, cocoa, berry fruits, dried grapefruit, hard peel, wood spices, dark toffee, and oak.

91,Bruichladdich Black Art 05.1 1992,,Single Malt Scotch,330,"As ever, the composition of Black Art is a closely guarded secret, and this is distiller Adam Hannett’s first such assembly. Rich aromas of fig, succulent autumn berries, sherry, cream, and malt feature on the complex, floral nose. Viscous on the palate, which opens dry, with developing berry fruits and spicy oak, plus dried fruits and candied peel. Long and drying in the finish, with plum and peppery oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2017
91,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 011),,Bourbon/Tennessee,85,"At 6 years old it’s hard to believe this could get any better with more time in the barrel. It begins with an explosion of honey, warm graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg, and marzipan. Then it’s saddle leather, pumice, caramel-covered popcorn, and jalapeño-and-peach jam spread over a flat tamale. More baking spices develop as the whiskey finishes long with a lovely salted-caramel note.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
91,Buchanan’s Red Seal,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,169,"Inhale deeply and this bestows a sense of serenity; morning dew on clipped lawns strewn with spent fireworks and strands of honey mingled with subtle, elegant smoke. Blender Maureen Robinson’s light, well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness, before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. Charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie, iced coffee, and milk chocolate follow, leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. Quite a charmer.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017

An ever-changing spectrum of flavors delights the palate: vanilla, crisp cinnamon, dusty cocoa, hot chocolate, pepper, and bramble jelly. Any keen importers reading this? €47",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
91,Compass Box 3 year old Deluxe,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,300,"Not the pimply youth you might be mistakenly expecting, this tongue-in-cheek release is impishly contemptuous of the regulations challenged by Glaser during the transparency debate. Lemon bonbon, heavy vanilla scents, beeswax boot polish, and white chocolate are well integrated with peat. The exotic fruits and citrus zest tumbling with golden syrup are knocked sideways by clove and pepper. Water provokes more sweet smoke. A dry, spicy, waxy finish remains. (3,282 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
91,Four Roses Single Barrel,,Bourbon/Tennessee,61,"This is a 9 year old from the OBSF recipe. Brings to mind intense cinnamon over fruit, sprinkled on pumpkin bread, cooked in kettle popcorn, with a scone. Then there’s an explosion of caramel: crème brûlée, salted German chocolate cake, glazed doughnut holes, and caramel-drizzled baked peaches. Hints of smoke, ginger, tobacco, and clove. A delightfully long finish carries a hint of cinnamon for a must-have quaff. (<em>Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive</em>)",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017

91,Longmorn 23 year old,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,1450,"The oldest house bottling of Longmorn to date is non-chill filtered and lavishly presented in a purple casket, which probably accounts for a chunk of the purchase price.

91,Teeling Single Grain,46.0,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,45,"Soft berry fruits and roasted spices, draped in the wine flavors of the California Cabernet Sauvignon barrique. The flavors start softly, with rhubarb, apple, blackberry fruit, and Brazil nut before a spice steamroller rattles through, jettisoning licorice and star anise over cooked fruits. The reverberations of the spices continue through a dry finish. With the grain as a canvas, the wine’s colors work particularly well here.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
91,Stalk & Barrel Red Label Blend (tweaked),43.0,Canadian,39,"The feedback loop is short when the guys who make the whisky also pour it for consumers. This “tweaked” version of Red Label blends home-distilled corn, rye, and single malt whiskies with a sourced base. Tweaking the proportions yields a brighter, bolder, and crisper whisky than the original, with soaring esters, fragrant flowers, succulent vanillas, and brisk spices.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2017
91,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla) 1967,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,763,"Part of the Rare Vintage range, this was matured in first-fill sherry butts. Spicy sultanas and figs on the nose, plus a menthol note. Fragrant old hessian. The palate is initially malty-sweet, with sherried Christmas cake notes, then plain chocolate and raisins emerge.

91,Timorous Beastie 40 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,246,"There should be few qualms about snapping up this aged Highland gem given the blender’s prowess and the generous pricing. Ripe stone fruit, straw, sweet oak, and ground almond on the nose. For its advancing years, it’s quite a ride at full strength; thick, glossy, and mouth-coating with tangy sweet oranges, fudge, and candied citrus. Best sipped neat, it ebbs away with bright orange fruit and buzzy spices. (1,080 bottles) £200",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017

It’s dense and weighty; oozing with flavors of barley sugar, caramel, sweet oak, and some mature orange peel characteristics underpinned with ginger and pepper. Profoundly long, sweet finish pricked with bitter orange and spice. One of those great drams that you can happily imbibe at cask strength without dilution.

It begins with powerful caramel, baking spice, chocolate, cherries, cinnamon, and toffee. Then nuance and complexity. Honey, jalapeño, rosemary, <span class=""s1"">crème brûlée</span>, malt, and fruit, from the spicy citrus of grapefruit to prunes and dried apricots. Hard to believe this is over 100 proof, as you never sense the strength challenging you to find what’s next amidst the subtlety. Extremely long finish with cherry, cinnamon, and caramel.

Out of the gate, it’s caramel and vanilla, with a bevy of fruit, soft florals, and chocolate slightly trailing. Oak and smoke take the lead on the first turn, then an explosion of butterscotch and Spanish flan setting the pace. Then graham crackers, marshmallow, and melted chocolate eye the prize, with rich, rounded caramel custard taking the long route to the finish line. Definite contender!",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
91,Redemption Barrel Proof High Rye 9 year old,,Rye Whiskey,100,"First impression: spice and herbs completely own the moment. Then caramel, vanilla, and the cadre of baking spices develops into identifiable clove, cardamom, ginger, crushed poppy seeds, and cinnamon. Then the spice turns to another style: pepper, with hints of earthy black pepper and habañero jelly. Slight hints of vanilla, powdered sugar, and marshmallow appear just before a medium-to-long finish with a spicy caramel chew.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
91,Swiss Highland Ice Label Edition 1,,Swiss,186,"Inside an ice palace located 11,332 feet up the Jungfraujoch, this American oak <em>oloroso</em> butt matured gracefully at a chilly but constant 25°F. A rich vista of currants, red Anjou pears, pecan brittle, musty spices, and saline, with a rootsy, earthy vibe. Flavors climb through intense vanilla, fleeting balsamic notes, a ridge of succulent cherry, sherry, and sultana. Orange and grapefruit at the summit.

91,Woodford Reserve Frosty Four Wood,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Think the holidays: nutmeg, butterscotch, cinnamon, gingerbread cookies, and saltwater taffy. Mouth-coating sensations down the jawline and palate roof. Caramel and vanilla follow it home to the finish, where out-of-nowhere black currant and blackberry jam linger to the very end.

91,Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Straight Bourbon (Barrel #16B233),,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Released in the spring of 2016. True balance and consistency from nose to finish, showing toffee, saltwater taffy, cinnamon Jolly Rancher, <em>crème </em><em>brûlée</em>, nutmeg, toasted pecan, chocolate, fruit, delicate spice. Hints of pear, peach, and apple. I love the coffee and hazelnut on the long finish. I wonder if the taste would improve in the 107 to 111 proof range. As it is now, this is a must-have sipper.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
91,Ardbeg Dark Cove Committee Edition,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,110,"This is the bigger, spicier, and more complex of the pair <em>(see below)</em>. A prickly start leads to heavy peat smoke, pink and Szechuan peppercorns, vanilla, dark chocolate, angelica, then seaweed. The palate is oily, with a detonation of gunpowdery peat, licorice, smoked eel, and a feral edge that adds grunt. Layered and complex.",Dave Broom,Summer 2016

The barley in question was grown at Low Machrimore Farm in the south of the Kintyre peninsula and was distilled in September 1999.

91,Tomintoul Five Decades,50.0,Single Malt Scotch,359,"The soft fruit theme continues in this vatting of whiskies from, you guessed it, five decades of the distillery’s life. This has a heavy, heady, honey element alongside apple blossom and then peach and apricot pulp. There’s real complexity. The palate is lighter, although still layered with some heat. With water there’s more apricot skin and some banana. Don’t overwater, as it becomes a touch too tannic. You want that unctuous elegance. Highly recommended. £250",Dave Broom,Summer 2016
91,Mackmyra Moment Fenix,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,157,"Angela D’Orazio selected both birch sap wine and PX sherry casks, combined with a few punchy 30-liter casks for this beauty. An incredibly rich, intense, and complex nose; a medley of cooked fruits, cherry cake mix, marzipan, tree blossoms, stem ginger, herbs, cigar box, beech nuts, and scorched coconut. Unctuous and syrupy, the palate is immersed in vanilla extract, dry fruits, cocoa, and inky black coffee. A lengthy finish of oak, dark vanilla, and toasted coconut. Result? A whisky colossus. €140",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
91,Rock Town Single Barrel Reserve Rye (Barrel 22),,Craft Whiskey,60,"Cask-strength rye made from Arkansas-grown grain, aged 26 months. Must be a small barrel; it’s quite dark. Nose of crushed rye grain, well-polished oak furniture, and moist rye bread. Swift and certain in the mouth: dense, chewy flavors of rye bread, sweet and full and bitter, crackling with oak spice, and drawing to a sizzling finish. I do like a small distiller whiskey that knows where it’s going. Very impressive.",Lew Bryson,Summer 2016
91,Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Seasoned Wood,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"A wheated recipe bourbon that was aged in experimental barrels with staves utilizing various methods of seasoning. Oak spice is important with a wheated bourbon, as there is no rye to balance the sweet notes, and this whiskey does a great job here. Delicate in personality, with nutty caramel, dried citrus, and golden raisin segueing to polished leather, warming cinnamon, clove, and hints of a cigar humidor.",John Hansell,Summer 2016
91,"Booker’s 2016-01 “Bluegrass Batch,” 63.95%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"If Picasso sketched bourbon, it would look like Booker’s, with deep golden and auburn hues. But higher-proof color can deceive. Not here. Think bourbon warehouse: oak, caramel, tobacco leaf, cinnamon, vanilla; floral with hints of honey and blueberry. And then it really comes alive. Oh, baby! Candy corn, <em>crème brûlée</em>, maple syrup, nutmeg, and traces of chipotle and cayenne. The proof strength doesn’t show. I recommend this batch neat for full, unrelenting flavor.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2016
91,Ailsa Bay,,Single Malt Scotch,79,"The first release from Ailsa Bay distillery is an NAS peated single malt. The new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter Hudson Baby Bourbon casks. It’s then transferred to virgin oak, first-fill, and refill American oak casks for several years. The ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. A sweet, smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit, spicy peat, and cereal notes, with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (<em>UK and Nordic availability</em>) £55",Gavin Smith,Summer 2016
91,Finest Irish Whiskey 22 year old,,Irish,239,"Every so often, whether by blind luck or meticulous searching, a brilliant cask turns up. Fruit pastilles, peaches in syrup, caramelized apples, freshly baked bread, and lemons weeping juice, supported by the smoke from the glowing red fringes of burning newspaper. Lemon and grapefruit acidity in the mouth, developing creaminess, vanilla, and more tropical fruit characteristics, with some slightly bitter char surfacing after a minute. Candied grapefruit follows into the finish as the smoke rolls in. Rather glorious. (<em>The Whisky Exchange only</em>) £165",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
91,Forty Creek Three Grain Harmony,43.0,Canadian,70,"Three Grain Harmony marries rye and barley whiskies from 1992-94 to 4 year old corn whisky. The corn lends voluptuous body to a complex assortment of carefully integrated grains, dark fruits, prune juice, and butterscotch. Dried herbs, potpourri, and orange peel follow as the palate begins to broaden. When the big notes fade, look for delicate subtleties. Hot spices and pepper build from sip to sip and linger long into the sandalwood finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2015
91,Buffalo Trace Old Fashioned Sour Mash (125 Entry Proof),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Darker in both flavor and personality when compared to its sibling. Rich palate-coating caramel and toffee provide the foundation for roasted nuts, dark berry fruit, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and polished leather. Long, satisfying finish. Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Barrel Aged Bourbons 2015 Release. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
91,Ardbeg Supernova 2015 Release,,Single Malt Scotch,160,"Apparently this is the final Supernova release and the Ardbeg team has ensured it goes out with all guns blazing. Although it seems calm initially—there’s a minty and sweet spicy element to the fore—the smoke begins to push through in the guise of creosote, then sootiness which, in turn, mingles with seaweed aromas. The peat dominates the palate but there is sufficient oiliness to round it out and add layers of smoked fish, and dried grasses. Farewell.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
91,The Dalmore 21 year old,42.0,Single Malt Scotch,530,"Dalmore released 8,000 bottles of its latest 21 year old, initially matured 10 years in American oak barrels before an 11 year period of secondary maturation in first-fill Matusalem <em>oloroso</em> sherry butts from Gonzalez Byass. Intense aromas of Jaffa orange, marzipan, and ginger, plus soft oak. Robust, yet stylish. Smooth and well-rounded on the palate, with milky coffee, orange marmalade, cinnamon, and developing spicy dark chocolate. The lengthy finish is spicy, with licorice, a hint of citrus, and sweet oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2015
91,Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Scapa,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"As you raise the glass to your nose, this has refreshment written all over it. The fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist, zesty orange notes, honey, peach pits, a hint of salt, and the faintest trace of smoke. It’s silky smooth, glistening with honey, a firm edge of orange, vanilla tablet, barley sugar, powdered ginger, all elevated by the grains supporting the Scapa. A smooth, feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. A joy to behold.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
91,Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Century,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,500,"Rich and sweet on the nose: crème brûlée, unfinished oak furniture, circus peanuts, overripe warm melon. Corn puffs and sweet cornbread, vanilla cream, oak density, firm heat, and an affably full mouthfeel that doesn’t thin till the very end. Easily one of the best Jack Daniel’s whiskeys I’ve ever had, but the price is jaw-dropping even today (the package does include a previously-unreleased 1966 concert recording of Old Blue Eyes). Price is per 1 liter.",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
91,Cadenhead’s (distilled at Linkwood) 1989,,Single Malt Scotch,300,"Powerful and rich to begin with. Some raisin syrup backed with clean, apple-like acidity adding some freshness. This swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. Highly complex, but full of distillery character. Water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. The palate is smooth, gentle, and deep. A classic mature Linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask.",Dave Broom,Winter 2015
91,Metze’s Select,,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Old school spicy nose, almost archetypal scents of sweet teaberry, cinnamon, and spearmint hard candy, with a firm, warm alcohol backing. True in the mouth: I’m tasting just what I smelled, all on a full bed of corn sweetness, floating off into a warm finish. Could it be more complex? Yes, but it’s beautifully balanced, and not the over-oaked shellac that passes for mature bourbon these days. If this was under $30 a bottle, I’d marry it. (6,000 bottles)",Lew Bryson,Winter 2015
91,Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye,45.0,Canadian,26,"A blend of 95% rye-grain flavoring whisky with a variety of base whiskies. Its big whisky cocktails will tempt mixers into sipping. Very fruity and floral, with prunes, peaches, red apple skins, and bouquets of spring flowers all boosted by vibrant peppery spices on a slightly oaky base. Crown Royal’s signature balsam resin note and hints of vanilla round it out. The long, spicy finish ends with hints of citrus pith. A complex, tightly woven blend. <em>(U.S. only) </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
91,Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit (Barrel #98),,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"A single barrel bottling from Warehouse N, rick number 1, bottled at the proof that Wild Turkey was designed to be. A deeply-woody spiced nose featuring cinnamon and caramel advertises a power punch whiskey, but on the palate there&#039;s no punch. Instead, it’s lush, round, and affable, with deep caramel and cinnamon co-mingling with peanut. The lush, sweet start is well-balanced by cinnamon spice, which ramps up and drives a long spicy finish. This is delicious whiskey. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
91,Wild Turkey Master’s Keep,,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"A very pricy (for Wild Turkey) 17 year old whiskey honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell. Nose is hot for the proof, with oak, dried barrel drool, warm dried corn, tobacco barn, and teaberry. Entry is not hot; rather, a thread of sweet syrup spreads out into thoroughly integrated corn and oak. Finish slides into drier oak. A fascinating journey through bourbon flavors, this is both lighter and more complex than expected. I still prefer younger Wild Turkey, but…",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
91,The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 50 year old 1964,,Single Grain Whisky,657,"You really don’t see many of these. Pear drops, stewed apple, strawberry jam, fragrant rhubarb stems, and vanilla pods. Neat, there’s a tacky sweetness of hard candy, with bitter skins of damson and green plum, sloes, and custard creams. Counteract this with water to bring out acetone, cake mix, and sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and creamed coconut. Then it is triumphant. Dry oak and dark vanilla complete one of the longest finishes I’ve savored this year. (<em>111 bottles</em>) £420",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
91,Hart Brothers (distilled at Glen Grant) 22 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,103,"A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. Excellent. £66",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
91,Blade and Bow 22 year old,46.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"This whiskey includes bourbon distilled at Buffalo Trace and Bernheim; its final aging was at Stitzel-Weller. Sweet and rich, with a mouth-coating velvety texture. Deeper and more polished than its younger NAS sibling (see below). Caramel, cocoa powder, lush orchard fruit, kiwi, Seville orange, fig, and honeyed vanilla, balanced by drying oak. Distinctive in character. Best after a hearty meal.",John Hansell,Fall 2015
91,Forty Creek Double Barrel Reserve (Lot 252),40.0,Canadian,47,"Finished in wet, freshly dumped bourbon barrels, Double Barrel shows strong bourbonesque vanilla and a slippery, almost syrupy lushness. This latest batch is even creamier than the early ones made by John Hall himself. After a deceptively simple start, a mouth-filling toffee sweetness broadens into ripe tropical fruits with fleeting under-notes reminiscent of earthy dragonfruit. Hot, peppery flares punctuate the soft fruitiness as it moves to the fore and the creamy mouthfeel subsides.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
91,Tullibardine 1952,,Single Malt Scotch,23427,"This bottling is from the oldest cask owned by Tullibardine distillery, a sherry quarter cask (#341). An initial whiff of Cointreau on the nose, then vanilla develops, with marzipan, white pepper, linseed, and old hessian. Finally, musty sherry. A silky mouthfeel, with drier sherry, black currants, dark spices, and plain chocolate. Extraordinarily lingering, with orange wine gums and spicy licorice. Despite 50 years of maturation in a relatively small sherry cask, a whisky of great depth and quality has emerged. £16,000",Gavin Smith,Summer 2015
91,The Last Drop 1965 Blend 48 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,4000,"Originally blended, then recasked into fresh bourbon wood three decades ago, the nose of ripened peaches, cooked pear, pecan nuts, menthol, clove, and vanilla make for a compelling combination. A surprising lift of red summer fruits as this bright whisky sashays around the mouth, the complexity measured out in installments; plum sauce, toasted oak, coffee bean, gingersnaps, clove, licorice, and hints of savory juices. It dances on and on with the whirling wood spices in no hurry whatsoever. (592 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
91,Redbreast Mano a Lámh,46.0,Irish,69,"Oh, hello there. Meaning hand in hand in two languages, this Redbreast was solely matured in Galician oak seasoned with <em>oloroso</em> for 2 years at the Páez Morilla bodega in Jerez. A slightly closed nose of eucalyptus, menthol, and apple pre-empts a rich, fruity, cherry bomb of dark sugars, strawberry laces, morello, and clove. The fabulous pot still character ends on a sliver of mint as the fruit gently dulls. (<em>2,000 bottles</em> <em>exclusively for The Stillhouse, Midleton’s single pot still club</em>) €65",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
91,Douglas Laing Extra Old Particular (distilled at Mortlach) 22 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,280,"Deep amber. Generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe, with dried orchard fruits, chestnut puree, and indeed chestnut honey, then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to Guyanan pot still rum. Sumptuous. As it opens there’s a fluxing mix of sticky toffee, game, pomegranate, and dried red fruits. The palate is deeply savory, with floor polish and cooked plums, finishing with fragrant pepper. The cask has a huge say in things, but the spirit copes. Excellent. £191",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
91,Forged Oak 15 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,65,"The fifth release in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series (and the youngest of the releases so far). Distilled at the “new” Bernheim distillery and, once again, matured most recently in Stitzel-Weller warehouses. Complex flavors are well-integrated, with lovely spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, mint, nutmeg), nougat, caramel, and subtle fruit. Long, satisfying finish. Not as distinctive as some previous Orphan Barrel releases, but more rounded and balanced. Nicely done!",John Hansell,Summer 2015
91,Box The Festival 2014,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,101,"Disgorge bourbon quarter-casks after 3 years and fill them into sixteen virgin American oak 40-liter casks that have been made from air-seasoned wood, medium toasted then charred, and what do you get? Maple syrup, pecan pie nuttiness, piercing vanilla, fluffy cotton candy, and the char note of the dome of a well-fired fruitcake. The palate chews through nut brittle, butterscotch, praline, nutmeg, baked banana, and active wood spices, with the sweetness of a good bourbon. Respect. (700 bottles) 889 SEK",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
91,Armorik Sherry Finish,40.0,French Whisky,58,"Sticky short ribs from the <em>churrascaria</em>, black pepper, allspice, and a little leather. This is a richly savory whisky with a substantial mouthfeel that’s never chewy. It was matured for 4 years in bourbon wood, then finished in <em>oloroso</em> sherry casks, creating a palate of figs, mixed peel, dried chili flakes, mocha, and whole black peppercorns. Perfectly weighted, right down to the <em>ristretto</em> finish with whole wheat digestive biscuits. Bold, audacious, and voluptuous.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
91,Ninety Decades of Richness 20 year old,45.0,Canadian,40,"Tempting vanilla custard with swirls of orange marmalade and just-burnt toffee. Icing sugar, red cedar, and oak with pithy tannins and sizzling spices: pepper, hot cinnamon, and ginger. Then a fruitiness unfolds into crisp Granny Smith apples and chewy jujubes. Gradually, the layers peel back, revealing delicate hints of buttered popcorn, mealy marzipan, candy cane, and burley tobacco. The subtle earthiness of cooked corncobs complements sour fruits and sweet spices. Huge, complex, and beautifully balanced. <em>(Canada only)  </em>C$50",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
91,William Larue Weller,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Distilled in 2002. For many years now, this wheated whiskey has maintained just the right amount of oak influence for balance and added complexity. This year’s release is sporting some extra dried oak spice (especially on the finish), but it’s still a delicious whiskey. Notes of toffee, maple syrup, blackberry jam, cinnamon, and vanilla, with a dry, allspice and polished leather finish.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
91,Eagle Rare 17 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Often ignored because it’s not barrel proof like the other bourbons in the collection. The past couple years have shown a gradual increase in oak spice and resin. This year’s offering particularly sports unnecessary oak, showing more leather, dried spice (especially cinnamon), barrel char and tannins than needed to marry with the toffee, caramel, rum, mocha, dried fruit, and tobacco notes. Still very enjoyable, but slightly past its prime.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
91,The Balvenie Tun 1509,,Single Malt Scotch,369,"This newbie from Balvenie is the worldwide replacement for the market-specific Tun 1401. A larger volume vat (8,000 liters) is now being filled with an equally eclectic mix of casks (42 casks ranging from 1970 to 1992). Deep amber; this has substance but being Balvenie, it’s gentle: orange blossom/Manuka honey edged with spice, marmalade, scented woods, and a little frangipane. The palate shows a supple, rippling power with some apricot, cinnamon, and root ginger. Awfully good. £230",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
91,Cragganmore 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,500,"The question is how this stacks up against the Friends of the Classic Malts bottling, one of my 2014 highlights. This shows mature distillery character with that discreet meaty undertow bedding down exuberant top notes: icing sugar on rhum baba, preserved lime, crystallized fruits, honey, pecan, fig, and scented woods. Typical of Cragganmore in its constantly shape-shifting character. The palate is concentrated orchard fruits, dried fruits, light spice, chestnut puree, and a little smoke. So yes, in the same league. (3,372 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
91,Canadian Club Chairman&#039;s Select 100% Rye,40.0,Canadian,27,"Although this whisky was distilled at CC’s sister plant in Alberta, the dried dark fruit signature of Canadian Club is evident as soon as you open the cap. Elegant, but never subdued; cloves, nutmeg, and allspice play off the fruit and underlying notes of clean grain dust. Vanilla and rich woody tones indicate at least some virgin oak barrels were used for its 7 year maturation. Rich caramels soften a gently glowing heat. Complex and beautifully balanced. <em>(Canada only) </em>Value Pick.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2014
91,Nikka 40 year old,45.0,Japanese,4474,"A celebration of Nikka’s 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and, in the spirit of the founding principles of Masataka Taketsuru, it’s a blend. The oldest cask here is Yoichi from 1945, there’s also a Miyagikyo from 1969. Only 900 bottles have been made. Huge whisky <em>rancio</em>, delicate smoke, light varnish, wax, hints of incense, and while rich, there is still remarkably fresh tropical fruit. Tasted blind, it could easily be mistaken for a Grand Champagne Cognac. Amazing length and purity. Sophisticated. €3,600",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
91,Craigellachie 23 year old,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,536,"Here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 <em>(see below)</em>. Now, there is added spice, ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits, and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. With water, a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. Complex and deep. The palate remains thick and silky, with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. Structured, layered, long, and elegant. £337",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
91,Celtic Cask Aon,46.0,Irish,311,"It’s like Mom’s apple pie in a glass. This whiskey was distilled at Cooley and spent 14 years in bourbon, then 2 years extra maturation in an 80 year old <em>Palo Contado</em> sherry cask from Bodegas Emilio Hidalgo. Brown sugar, baked apples, warmed almonds, chocolate jimmies, nutmeg, vanilla, and cardamom. Sherry flavors caress, with apple, spun sugar, candied peel, sultanas, stone fruits, and the fruitiness of Scharffen Berger bars. Gracefully wanes, meditating on the red and black fruits. (711 bottles) €250",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2014
91,John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2014 Edition,,Blended Scotch Whisky,840,"Smoke begins Jim Beveridge’s public replication of the annual Directors Blend concept, built around Johnnie Walker’s signature characteristics. Peat smoke harks back to Islay, but there’s wood smoke, tobacco leaf, and malt, with a salty richness behind it. The grain just gives it a lift of extra sweetness. Polished, with great structure; red apple, raspberry, and sweet linctus wrap up with a long, smoky finish of cigar stub and peat stores. Clear parallels with Directors Blend 2009, but better. (8,888 decanters released) £500",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
91,Ardbeg Supernova Committee bottling 2014,55.0,Single Malt Scotch,160,"Pale and slightly flinty to start, with touches of Caol lla-style salt-washed rocks, but here there’s sweetness, while the smoke gives it a mezcal-like air; pears and burning wood (hot brake pads), minerality, then green olive and a light medicinal note. With water, sashimi-style cleanliness. The palate is rounded, with real olive oil, peppery sweetness, soot, and white chocolate. A real ‘palate whisky,’ filled with bare-faced bravado.  A great Ardbeg.",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
91,Heaven Hill Select Stock Barrel #44823,64.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"An 8 year old wheated bourbon, finished 27 months in Frapin cognac casks. A dark, opulent nose: cocoa, crushed sweet cherry, and vanilla custard, laced with cinnamon and fired with the alcohol heat. My, my…it’s even enjoyable at full proof, and delivers the sweet promise on a solid bed of oak and heat. Heaven Hill’s getting good at these finishes. Expensive, but impressive. <em>(Kentucky Bourbon Affair bottling; others are similar—Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center only)</em>",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
91,Benjamin Prichard’s Double Barreled Bourbon,45.0,Craft Whiskey,65,"Many distilleries have released bourbon finished in a second barrel, but it’s Prichard’s who was savvy enough to copyright the term “double barreled.”  As you’d expect, the nose is big oak, blending darker, more seasoned oak with lighter, new oak. The palate is unexpectedly balanced, with lush, sweet caramel in perfect sync with spicy oak, black pepper, clove, and cinnamon. That wonderful balance follows through to a medium finish that doesn’t leave you feeling like you’ve been chewing on a barrel.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
91,Broger Burn Out,42.0,Austrian Whisky,64,"My, my, hey, hey. Freshly-laid asphalt and a swarm of peat buzzes up the nose. Heavy oilskins, stout wellingtons, and bladderwrack entangled in lobster pots. There is charming sweetness; a pussycat compared to the tiger of a nose. A thick, teeth-coating, warming glow emanates from deep at the back of the palate, with some roasted orange and dark chocolate. Superb balance between the peat and the sweetness. A triumph. It’s better to burn out than to fade away. €48",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
91,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 115,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Smooth, with gently layered sweet notes; nicely balanced. The least amount of oak and just a peppering of cinnamon and mint influence compared to the other four releases. It’s the most versatile of the four too.Not as complex as the “Rye 125”, but it makes up for this with its inviting drinkability and balance. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
91,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 125,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Complex and robust, with the biggest body of the group here. Very spicy (brisk clove, evergreen, warming cinnamon), but a solid sweet underbelly of toffee, caramel, and vanilla balances it. Its dry spicy finish makes a bold statement, without crossing the line. Very nice! Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
91,Lock Stock & Barrel 13 year old,,Rye Whiskey,100,"Beautifully boxed for gift giving, a quality that carries over into the whiskey itself. Fresh-cut red cedar unfolds into hard candy, green apples, nail polish, rye bread, and ripe black cherries on the nose. Vague cedar on the palate becomes fruity and floral, then hot and spicy. Distant licorice root is restrained by German rye bread. Earthy but not dusty, with a sweet, hot, effervescent spiciness. Fades in a long, tingling finish. Complex and expressive: rich yet ethereal.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
91,Green Spot,40.0,Irish,50,"Roll out the red carpet, because Green Spot is coming to town. Baked apple, spiced sultanas, lush green lawns, and ripe green fruits greet the nose. It’s oily, smothering, and luxuriantly juicy, with a depth of character that tips over the back of the tongue like nectar. That mélange of light vanilla, butterscotch, and creamy rice pudding sprinkled with nutmeg is heavenly. If this doesn’t persuade you to fall in love with Irish pot still whiskey, then nothing will.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
91,Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila) 1984,,Single Malt Scotch,258,"Clearly Caol Ila; it’s the way that the oily smokiness seems to lean into the nose, bearing with it wet oilskins, a barely smoldering wood fire, light seashore elements (drying crab shells), and very pure fruit, which then opens to classic smoked ham aromas. Retronasally, there’s a touch of green pea pod. The smokiness is more assertive than normal on the tongue, with olive oil, deep fruits, and a pine-scented juniper note. Another belter. <i>(The Whisky Exchange only) </i>£155",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
91,Mackmyra Moment Glöd,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,183,"Mackmyra has made its name on the back of salty, often peaty whiskies, but this is a revelation. It&#039;s a spring whisky, with much in common with Bladnoch in the Scottish Lowlands or peated Connemara from Ireland: sweet apple and pear flavors flit over wispy drying smoke. Sweden is represented by juniper, but there is blackcurrant, while cinnamon plays a role, too. Subtle, sweet, and sexy. £110",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
91,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (2013 Edition) 12 year old,49.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"A delicious base of creamy vanilla and rich caramel, complemented by tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe mango), golden raisin, and raspberry preserve, and jazzed up with spice (cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg). Polished oak on the finish. The flavors are nicely integrated. My favorite of the last several annual releases.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
91,The Coronation (distilled at Glenfarclas) 1953,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask. Amazingly, the nose is not dominated by wood, but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed, tropical fruit, blonde tobacco, cedar, and chanterelle mushroom. This elegantly faded, sepia-tinted impression continues on the tongue: fine-boned, mossy, clean, and slowly drying. A classic example of oxidation, not woodiness, allowing freshness to be retained. Amazing. <i>(The Whisky Exchange exclusive.) </i>£6,000",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
91,Glenglassaugh 30 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The first release from the new owners of Glenglassaugh distillery is obviously intended as a showpiece expression, and it does not disappoint. Due in the States next year. Damp moss and cedar on the early nose. Sultanas, candied orange, maraschino cherries, and sherry. Treacle notes in time. Spicy fruits, figs, brittle toffee, sherry, and ginger on the mellow yet robust palate. The finish is medium in length, with allspice and old oak, plus a wisp of tarry smoke. £245",Gavin Smith,Winter 2013
91,Lombard Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Springbank) 21 year old 1991 Cask No. 172,,Single Malt Scotch,375,"Aged in a bourbon hogshead, allowing the distillery character to shine through. Fresh, lively and inviting (especially for its age), with a complex array of tropical and summer fruit, peppered with brine, vanilla, and a hint of baker’s chocolate. An oily texture adds weight. Dry, deliciously appetizing finish. An excellent aperitif whisky, but enjoyable anytime. <i>(D &amp; M Wines and Liquors exclusive.)</i>",John Hansell,Winter 2013
91,Kilchoman 2007,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,51,"The first thing I wrote was, “classic Kilchoman.” Then I paused…because it’s true. Though still young, here’s a distillery that has established its own character. In this expression you get full integration between oak and distillery, a sparkling mix of seashell and the freshness of seaweed, touched with churned butter, driftwood, and fresh-kilned peat. On the tongue, there’s samphire, peat, sweet barley, and an herbal kick. This is Kilchoman coming of age, assured and confident.",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
91,Ardbeg Ardbog,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The follow-up to last year’s Ardbeg Day, here’s the cult distillery in its funkiest

guise with a nose that’s reminiscent (I’d imagine) of a frontier trading post:

all pitch, furs, and gun oil. Some mint hangs around in the background

alongside eucalyptus. This is an earthy, in-your-face Ardbeg with a hint of

box-fresh sneakers indicating some youthfulness. The mouth is thick and chewy:

wild mint, oily depths, and the slightly manic energy typical of Ardbeg’s young

years. Editor's Choice.",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
91,Caol Ila Feis Ile Bottling 2013,,Single Malt Scotch,152,"Although aged in refill, then active hoggies, and finally sherry, there’s more smoke

than oak here, a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. A

note akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and

cream, but always mixed with seashore breezes. This is Caol Ila in deep and

bold mood with green fig, banana, and a sweet center. Water gives greater

integration. You might (just) be able to get this. Do it. <i>(distillery only) </i>£99",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
91,Ninety 20 year old,45.0,Canadian,,"Tucked away in the small Alberta town of High River, Highwood distillers has made large volumes of Canadian whisky and dozens of other distilled beverages since 1974. Undaunted by recent flooding and with more than three decades of aging whisky on hand, the owners recently decided to emphasize premium whiskies. Ninety, the latest of these, is simply gorgeous. Crispy clean oak, dark fruit, butterscotch,

corncobs, and nutmeg precede candy cane, sour fruits, cinnamon, ginger, and citrus pith.<i> (Canada only) </i>C$48",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2013
91,Teeling 21 year old Single Malt,,Irish,250,"Whoosh! Jack Teeling’s first golden arrow is this weird and wacky whiskey. Have you ever heard Jane&#039;s Addiction? This is to conventional whiskey what that band was to conventional rock. Finished in Sauternes casks, it&#039;s like nothing you&#039;ve tasted from Ireland. All the Irish characteristics are there, but they&#039;re bent and twisted and put together in a new and exhilarating order. I wasn&#039;t sure at first. Now I&#039;m begging for a refill just to make sure it all really happened.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
91,Paul John Single Cask Whisky P1-163,57.0,Indian Whisky,,"Another hard to get Indian whisky, but further proof that the category isn't a one-trick pony. This single cask release is the second from the John Distilleries and a significant step upward. An altogether more complex whisky with an earthy, prickly peat at one level, and a rich pureed pear heart with orange fruit and berries. The combination is quite gorgeous and with a little water you get whisky's answer to a summertime flower show. Impressive stuff. £60",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
91,Old Pulteney 40 Year Old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The oldest bottling of Old Pulteney to date has been matured in American bourbon and Spanish sherry casks, and was personally bottled by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. The nose of this highly accomplished veteran is fragrant and waxy, with cooking apples, milk chocolate orange, Christmas spices, vanilla, and fudge. Initially, the substantial palate offers spicy fresh fruits, seasoned timber, then a hint of brine, with sultanas and plain chocolate. The finish is figgy, gingery, and sherried.  £1,490",Gavin Smith,Spring 2013
91,Highwood 25 year old Calgary Stampede Centennial,40.0,Canadian,,"A few years ago, Alberta’s Highwood distillers purchased all the remaining stock from Potter’s whisky brokerage just over the Rocky Mountains in Kelowna. With it, Highwood skillfully created a sumptuous, limited-edition bottling that is as sweet, smooth, and creamy as French vanilla ice cream, and richer in fresh clean wood than a carpentry shop. Dried cloves and red cedar balance real maple syrup and butterscotch which, in turn, dissolve into sweet white grapefruit. (Alberta only) C$52",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
91,Wiser’s Legacy,45.0,Canadian,50,"Winemakers have long known that toasted oak is very spicy. Today’s whisky makers are slowly catching on. Cinnamon hearts and hot peppermint add zing to a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Although the whisky is not overly sweet, it has a candied feel. Cloves and hot pepper round out the spices while vanilla and butterscotch lend smoothness as they keep earthy, flinty rye notes under control. Essences of cedar cigar box and black, withered figs contribute additional complexity. C$50",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
91,Parker’s Heritage Collection “Blend of Mashbills”,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"A blend of two different 11 year old bourbons—one being a rye-based bourbon, the other being wheat-based. The wheat lends drinkability, while the rye contributes a spicy zing. The combination works very nicely, with light toffee, nutty caramel, nougat, soft orchard fruit, black cherry, vanilla, and cinnamon. (Note: this is the first of three different batches that will eventually be bottled.)",John Hansell,Winter 2012
91,Crown Royal XR (LaSalle),40.0,Canadian,,"Vanilla and oak nose, with a creamy layer of mint that warns you: Rye Ahead. And what a sweet rye wave it is, rolling in with green mint and grass, more bourbony oak and vanilla, lively spice on the top (with enough heat to keep it bold), and a finish that brings everything together. Beautifully integrated, and not overly woody, a tribute to the blending art of Canadian distillers. ",Lew Bryson,Fall 2012
91,The Dalmore 1969 42 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Initially filled into an ex-bourbon cask, then transferred into a Gonzales Byass oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry butt in 2005 for four years, before a final two years in a freshly-emptied bourbon barrel. The nose is initially floral, with overripe Seville oranges, figs, ginger, and cocoa powder. Peaches and almonds on the palate, before dark fruits and salted nuts appear. Drying oak is held at bay, and the final note is fat and figgy. Cask number 14; 233 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2012
91,"The Macallan Masters of Photography 1989 (Release 3, Cask #12251)",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Dark mahogany with ruby glints and a green rim. Lots of highly-polished oak as we move out of the woods and into a silent country estate. Wax polish and masses of whisky rancio. Sherry-soaked oak, dry leaves, currants, and ripe blackberry. Highly concentrated, but the fruits push their way through only lightly-resisting tannins. There’s a hint of smoke and Seville orange bitterness on the finish. My pick of the quartet. Excellent. 285 bottles.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
91,Cutty Sark Tam o' Shanter 25 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"In my opinion Cutty Sark 25 year old is one of the great blends, so a new version was always going to be a big ask. This one comes with a lot of packaging, so is it a victory for style over substance? Not at all. This is all about big flavors; burnt orange, juicy raisin, and dark chocolate; rich oak and exotic spice. A treat, and worthy of its heritage. But at that price—and bearing in mind it's a limited edition—are you going to open it? ",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
91,Yellow Spot,46.0,Irish,80,"After last year&#039;s pot still triple whammy from Irish Distillers, we couldn&#039;t expect any more, could we? Could we? Step forward Yellow Spot, which seems to hold the view that if you can&#039;t beat &#039;em, don&#039;t get in the ring; go and pick a fight somewhere else. The pot still green apple and nutmeg notes are there on the nose and palate, but the nose also has vanilla and marzipan. On the palate the whiskey trips off to Speyside with sweetness, citrus zest, and pepper. Another game changer. €65",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
91,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1970 (Cask #140),,Single Malt Scotch,530,"Another first fill sherry butt, giving its typical reddish-brown hue. This runs more into the clove, cassia, and allspice area than just dried fruit. While maturity is obvious, and there’s even a hint of dunnage/leatheriness, it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here. The distillery has fought back against the cask, and while still crepuscular in nature, there is a rich, concentrated, and mellow glow at its heart. £345",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
91,Duncan Taylor (distilled at Royal Lochnagar) 23 year old 1986,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Soft, soothing, and gentle. Layered fruit (bright orchard fruit, honeyed melon, kiwi, pineapple), polished oak, and hay, subtly spiced with vanilla bean, milk chocolate, evergreen, and cotton candy. Bottled at peak maturity. Very more-ish, too! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",John Hansell,Summer 2012
91,Kavalan Solist Fino,,Taiwanese Whisky,,"Each cask of this nicely packaged malt is selected by the distiller, and so there is considerable variation between batches. This one is a step up from last year's releases. It's slightly weaker, but the nose has firmed up into a delightful mix of fresh juicy grape and a spicy dustiness. Tastewise this takes an amazing journey from plummy, sweet fruit up front to a slow dominance of dry sherry at the end. The finish is longer than before. Excellent. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
91,Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1980 (bottled 2011),,Single Malt Scotch,,"A vatting of three first-fill American oak casks, for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing Cellar Collection range. The nose is full of aromas of anise, blackcurrant leaf, honeysuckle, jasmine, frangipani flowers, and a subtle almond sweetness. The palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character. Sublime. It won’t, however, be released in the U.S. £1,000",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
91,St. George's Chapter 7 Rum Finish 2011 edition,46.0,Single Malt English Whisky,,"Any lingering doubts that English whisky means business are dispelled by this whisky masterclass. This is a New Orleans show band of a whisky, bursting with vibrancy and happy, celebratory notes. The cask is all over this, with rum and raisin, milk chocolate, and mocha contributing to an all-round sweet treat. Not too sweet, though; and the malt at the center of this sings. £65",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2012
91,Parker’s Heritage Collection Barrel Finished 10 year old,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Heaven Hill’s first wood-finished bourbon. Finished for several months in cognac casks (reminiscent of Beam’s Distillers’ Masterpiece offering around a decade ago), which show nicely without dominating. Very silky and smooth in texture. Notes of graham cracker, dark fleshy fruit (ripe grape, blackberry brandy), light toffee, maple syrup on pancakes, and creamy vanilla. Great balance, distinctive, and perilously drinkable for 100 proof.",John Hansell,Winter 2011
91,The Dalmore Distillery Exclusive 1991,59.0,Single Malt Scotch,236,"Staff members at Dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling, which has been drawn from American white oak cask number 446, and bottled at cask strength. The out-turn comprises 450 bottles. Refined, polished oak on the nose. Honey, marzipan, caramel, and vanilla. Fragrant, with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. Warm leather, apricots, orange marmalade, cocoa powder, and developing spice on the palate. A long, spicy, citric finish. Finally, licorice. £150",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
91,Adelphi (distilled at BenRiach) 34 year old 1977 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,283,"Sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all, just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy, but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb. £180",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
91,Compass Box Great King Street Artist&#039;s Blend,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,45,"After a series of esoteric and expensive releases, Compass Box has decided to bring it all back to the people with a blend — and how! The journey sets out as we might expect; all sweet vanilla ice cream, stewed pear tart, and peach melba, but then a wave of spice and white pepper provides an unexpected but delightful twist. It’s like Spice Tree meets Hedonism…Spiconism if you like.",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
91,Balblair 1995,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"The latest Balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression, exclusive to global travel retail outlets. Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, Balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. Initially very fruity on the nose, with peaches and carnations, icing sugar on bonbons, then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. Stewed fruits on the early palate, full and confident, with developing spices and brittle toffee. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with dark chocolate and soft oak. Price is per 1 liter.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2011
91,Glen Grant 25 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Glen Grant’s new(ish) owner Campari is putting its money where its mouth is. Investment in plant, wood, and an impressive visitor center is slowly being backed up with a series of new releases. This venerable example comes from Gordon & MacPhail’s stocks, but is an official bottling due out in time for Christmas. This is GG in relaxed, avuncular mode: subtle woods, amber, Oolong tea, anise. The palate is old apple, fresh plum, cream, and ginger spiciness. £255(Available at the distillery, in France, and Travel Retail in Asia only.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
91,The Macallan 18 year old Sherry Oak,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,118,"Macallan’s 18 year old expression is, for me, the highlight of its regular sherried range. Deep amber in color. The nose is rich and heavily fruited: fruit cake, mulberry, a little moist gingerbread, the bloody depths of molasses. On the palate, dried fruits — more figgy than raisined — while the natural oiliness in the spirit balances the boisterous tannins from the European oak. A singed note on the finish (an extension of the molasses?) completes the picture. Balanced and complex.",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
91,Mortlach 16 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"With worm tubs and a fiendishly complex partial-triple distillation, Mortlach has adhered to an old style of making whisky — and older, richer, darker flavors. Big and bold, it is at its best in ex-sherry casks. The nose is meaty (think gravy/beef stock) with fig, raisin, and molasses. In the mouth it’s concentrated, with good grip and a savory sweetness. A cult malt. £41 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
91,Glenfarclas 175th Anniversary,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,131,"First things first — congratulations to the Grants of Glenfarclas on attaining their 175th anniversary. To celebrate, they have vatted together a cask from 1952 with one each from the following five decades — and released it at an exceptionally reasonable price! The nose has a lift of struck match immediately followed by cedar, pomegranate, blackberry jam, and Seville orange. There’s a thick caramel toffee sweetness to the palate alongside the classic ’Farclas depth where dried, but sweet, fruits repose. Recommended. £80 (Dave Broom) (Value Pick)",John Hansell,Summer 2011
91,Hart Brothers 18 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1990 vintage,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"Bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. Smart move! It really helps this whisky. This is a soft — almost elegant — Laphroaig (if that’s not an oxymoron). Very clean, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, brine, seaweed, and peat smoke, with just a teasing of the medicinal, band-aid notes that Laphroaig is known for. The owner-bottled 18 year old, which I rated a 90, is darker and drier, with more oak on the finish. I like this Hart Brothers expression just a little better.",John Hansell,Summer 2011
91,Clynelish,,Single Malt Scotch,,"There’s something enigmatic and highly attractive about this distillery and its deceased brother, Brora. Perhaps it’s the unpredictability; there are plenty of independent releases of varied and often questionable quality, and you’re never quite sure what’s going to turn up. Even iconic expressions such as the 30 year olds can vary from quite sublime to appalling and sulfury when in the wrong hands.

When the malts from both distilleries are good, though — and the official bottlings tend to be — they’re very, very good. This Clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning, its nose some way removed from the official 14 year old, and more in common with some recent Diageo-release Broras, mixing soft maritime notes with squiggly peat and some fruit notes. The palate is complex and attractive, with savory peat, sweet pineapple, salt, light fish, drizzled lemon, pepper, chili, and cardamom. It all makes for a big, complex, evolving (and grown up) whisky — and great value for the price tag. ",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
91,Lagavulin,,Single Malt Scotch,112,"You want and expect rich and peaty malt from Lagavulin and you get it here in droves, though not in the most obvious way. This version is somewhere between the cask strength 12 year old and the Distiller’s Edition, rather than the standard 16 year old, but it’s an absolute peach and a treat for lovers of this distillery. The nose is constrained and shy at first, with lychee and kiwi fruit offering a sweet and gentle carpet to coastal peaty notes. The palate is big, rich, full, and peppered, with sharp apple and citrus fruits. It benefits from water, too, as there’s a delightful swell of fruit, chili, peat, and soft licorice. As with all great Lagavulins, the tarry peatiness lingers longest in the finish.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
92,Knappogue Castle 12 year old Marchesi di Barolo Wine Cask-Finished,46.0,Irish Single Malt,80,"Baked plum desserts, sweet cherry, star anise, and dark vanilla on the nose, with an enticing freshly toasted spiciness. Caramel, plum, pomegranate, and rawhide shoelaces shift into a concentrated fruitiness as allspice and pepper well up, yielding a sweet core of graham crackers, marshmallows, and creamy vanilla, with hints of chocolate. Bruised fruit and throbbing spices characterize the finish on this laudable example of wine finishing. (1,020 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Knappogue Castle 12 year old Marco De Bartoli Marsala Cask-Finished,46.0,Irish Single Malt,80,"Aromas of green apples, zested lime, and caramel entice the senses with hints of banana peel and nuts. Succulent green apple, honey, and vanilla, this has a thick, syrupy, mouth-drawing palate. Baked pear and peppery spices continue into the finish. This expression feels recognizably part of the Knappogue Castle family, yet offers a more sophisticated and progressive take on finishing. (1,020 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Four Roses Small Batch Select Straight,52.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"Using six of the distillery’s ten recipes, including the V yeast strain that imparts delicate fruit notes—here presenting as Pixy Stix, Rocket Pops, and cherry pie—and the F yeast strain that offers herbal notes, like licorice root, earthy tea leaf, and root beer. There’s also orange blossom, pecans, cedar chest, and tobacco. Aromas and flavors unfold in layers, with rich oak, roasted pecans, and vanilla whipped cream juxtaposed against peppery spice, blueberry-cinnamon crumble, and sweet tea. Water reveals new depths.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
92,Michter’s US*1 Barrel Strength Single Barrel Straight Rye (Barrel 19C472),,Rye Whiskey,75,"Complex and complete, the sweet and chewy aromas of maple syrup and crème de marrons meet milk chocolate and Andes Mints. On the palate, the intense layered sweetness of vanilla, crème brûlée, pecan pie, butterscotch, and honey is tempered by chili spice and deep earthy notes of leather and tobacco, before toffee and baking spices carry into the long finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
92,Bruichladdich 26 year old Black Art 1990 (Edition 06.1),,Single Malt Scotch,420,"Tangerines on the nose, then Turkish Delight, sliced cucumber, new leather, toffee, soft spices, and a hint of char. Mouth-coating, with sweet orchard fruits dipped in cream. Sharper fruit notes in time, with almonds and ginger. Icing sugar, milk chocolate, spicy oak, a fleeting savory note, and lingering fruitiness in the finish. Shows well-integrated character. (18,000 bottles) <em>Collectibles</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
92,Bunnahabhain 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,140,"The nose is nutty and yields sweet sherry, Jaffa orange, old leather, instant black coffee, and a suggestion of ozone. The palate is oily and textured, with more sherry, dried fruits, nutmeg, and dark chocolate. The finish lingers with brine and pepper.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
92,Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1991,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,750,"Influenced by a final decade spent in oloroso sherry and Burgundy casks. The nose offers orange segments dipped in honey, plus nougat, icing sugar, and more piercing citrus notes. The palate is supple, with milk chocolate and orange juice, joined by damsons and wood spices. A mouth-drying note persists behind juicy fruits, with aniseed and black pepper. The finish yields peaches dipped in salt and spicy oak. <em>Collectibles</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
92,Springbank 25 year old (2019 Release),46.0,Single Malt Scotch,800,"The nose features peat, ozone, malt, sherry, mango, charcuterie, and an herbal note. Overt sherry and rum on the palate, with pineapple, caramel, worn leather, and bonfire smoke. The finish is long and earthy, with chocolate and spicy oak. (160 bottles for U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
92,Tyrconnell 16 year old Oloroso & Moscatel Cask Finished,46.0,Irish Single Malt,100,"Sweet sherry with a heady spring floral intensity, lemon, honey, and graham crackers, yet delicate as a dandelion seed in a summer breeze. The palate is seductively sweet, with honey, effervescent lemon sherbet, caramel, and spices, showing a little more of the wine, fruit, and hints of citrus. Distinctively different, the finish is initially drying, then the fruit returns with a grapefruit peel sharpness. Terrifically good dram. (18,000 bottles) <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Kilchoman 11 year old ImpEx Cask Evolution 01/2019 Single Cask Bourbon Cask Finished (Cask #302/2007),,Single Malt Scotch,175,"Earthy, with charcoal smoke on the nose, sea shells, citrus oil, and a candied note of lemon pastille. A powerful palate offers bonfire smoke, iodine, grilled sausage, and black pepper, with lemon oil, bitter chocolate, and light earthiness. The finish has some salinity, as well as more bonfire smoke and bitter espresso. Assertive but balanced, well-structured and smooth. A dynamic whisky that’s an iron fist in a velvet glove. (230 bottles for U.S.)",David Fleming,Fall 2019
92,Redbreast 12 year old Cask Strength (Batch B1/18),,Irish Single Pot Still,84,"This batch heightens the fruitiness of apple, orange peel, dried strawberry, and peach over potent spices on the nose. Strawberry and raspberry flavors revel in the oily richness, then crescendo to a pot still spice storm that rages in the mouth like a swarm of bees. Long, spicy finish with vestiges of fruit and toasted oak. Thrill-seekers’ whiskey, if you dare.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Royal Salute 21 year old The Lost Blend,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,135,"Nuts sinking into molten toffee wrapped in pure, sensuous smoke on a foundation of cedarwood, dried fruits, and seasoned oak: as exotic as the box’s interior artwork. Sandy Hyslop’s multi-phasic blend draws on closed distillery Imperial’s trademark fruitiness and peated Caperdonich, while maintaining a steady hand on the balance. Toffee sweetness, mixed peel, pepper, nutmeg, citrus, and smoke. Creamy, satisfying finish with hints of melted chocolate and light smoke. <em>(Travel Retail)</em>",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Kentucky Owl Straight Bourbon (Batch 8),,Bourbon/Tennessee,300,"A nose of cherry, peppermint, vanilla frosting, pound cake, buttered toast, cherries, cola, peanut shells, rye seed, and old warehouse. The palate is big and powerful yet smooth and sophisticated. It’s chewy and spicy, with chocolate fudge, peanuts, white pepper, fresh cherries, bitter espresso, leather, and old oak. There’s great length on a finish of chocolate, cocoa powder, raspberry, cigar box, and baking spice. Toasty and delicious; a tour de force.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
92,Gooderham & Worts 49 Wellington Blended,49.0,Canadian,75,"This blend of rye, barley, corn, and wheat whiskies starts big on the nose with caramel-donut glaze that dissolves into buckwheat honey, then sweet orange marmalade. Spices are ever-present, but restrained, while a creamy sweet breadiness prevails throughout. Cereal notes on the palate are awash in honey sweetness. A soft yet tightly integrated whisky with depth and complexity. 100 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
92,Shelter Point Double Barrel Single Malt,50.0,Canadian,64,"Two-row barley grown on the distillery farm yields a glorious dram, with berries instantly on the nose accompanying fragrant dry hay. The sweet fruitiness of the nose becomes clear overtones of wild Vancouver Island blackberries on the palate. This is big whisky, with exotic fruits, hot spices, and nutty, grainy marzipan notes. Restrained oak allows fruits and spices to shine. Slowly, a lingering spicy finish turns sweet and fruity. 85 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
92,Bardstown Bourbon Company Phifer Pavitt Reserve,,Bourbon/Tennessee,125,"Aromas of oak, dried fruit, and horse saddle set up for a sucker punch of leather boxing glove from this big and brawny bourbon. But it also dances with grace, tickling the tongue with sweet spices, dark bitter chocolate, and wisps of tobacco. Intriguing notes of horehound, cocoa-dusted almonds, and baked apples are lip-smacking good, and it handles water well, revealing ever more depth.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
92,Tumblin’ Dice 11 year old Straight Bourbon,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Some whiskies reveal their maturity with just one whiff, and this is one of them, with notes of varnish and mothballs, along with cooked dark fruits—cherries, blackberries, blueberries—sassafras, root beer, and rich spices. More maturity is revealed on the palate, which is tannic but not dry, and viscous, showing off blackberry cobbler, brandied cherries, pecans, roasted peanuts, cracked pepper, and ginger. An excellent, lengthy finish that draws out the fruity, rich spice and practically demands a cigar.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
92,Matsui The Peated,48.0,Japanese,90,"Satisfyingly smoky, with noticeable structure and complexity: grilled fish, burning aromatic grasses, cocoa powder, and jellied and tropical fruit flavors. Soft pulpy fruits to taste, with red apple, nippy ginger and pepper spices, a surge of orange and mango flavors, and a backdraft of smoke. The nostrils still detect a delightful kipperiness. Smoke writhes like a serpent on the finish, sliding off walls dripping with sweet tropical fruits. (3,972 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Jameson Caskmates Angel City Brewing Co. Edition,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"A brilliant collaboration with the Los Angeles craft brewery, the nose has red apple, dry grasses, orange pith, toasted bakery goods, and background spices. The beer influence is every bit as good as Caskmates IPA. The palate is classic Jameson: honeyed, soft, light fruit, vanilla, and peppercorn, developing a wonderful creaminess, dark orange, further spices, and lastly, chocolate notes. Glowing and kind of dreamy.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
92,Jameson Caskmates KelSo Pale Ale Edition,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Of all the Caskmates, this edition representing Brooklyn is more complex, and offers a greater balance between the fruit and pot still spices than all the rest. There are bright floral notes, citrus, dry spices, and roasted barley—everything in perfect harmony. Clementine, honey, nuts, tropical fruit, a few savory elements, with finely ground spices fizzling away under waves of citrus fruit, candied peel, and flakes of chocolate.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
92,Dewar’s 21 year old Double Double,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Like opening a box of chocolates and hungrily inhaling the aromas of fruity chocolate, caramel, and soft centers. In addition, there are crystalized orange slices, fresh plum, black cherry, moist coffee grounds, and petrichor. Flavors of chocolate-dipped raspberries, gingersnaps, and bold sherry fruit from the oloroso finish. It’s a dance between the smoke and the fruit, with the smoke ultimately pushed to the fringes, leaving a spiced mocha finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
92,Glengoyne 30 year old (2018 Edition),,Single Malt Scotch,800,"This second annual limited release was matured in a combination of first-fill European oak sherry butts and refill sherry butts. Spicy orange marmalade on the nose, with plums dipped in honey, warm leather, polished oak, and cinnamon. The palate is oily, with dark sherry, cocktail cherries, ginger, espresso, and sweet oak.

92,Benromach Heritage 1973,,Single Malt Scotch,1722,"This 42 year old expression was matured in a single American oak hogshead (#4606) and offers a lovely mature, fruity nose, especially peaches and pineapple, plus vanilla and marzipan. Smooth and rich on the palate, with sherry, hessian, and spicy pineapple. Dries steadily but satisfyingly, with a hint of smoky fruit. Another veteran classic from the team at Forres. (52 bottles) £1,400",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
92,The Dalmore 35 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This is comprised of whisky aged in a bourbon barrel, a 30 year old Matusalem sherry butt, and a Colheita port pipe. Figs and malt on the early nose; resinous, with tangerines, vanilla, and soft leather. Slightly thin on the palate, but very smooth, with spiced orange, dates, and coffee grounds. Dries very slowly in the finish, with persistent orange, a sprinkling of black pepper, and a suggestion of mouth-drying oak. (1,000 bottles per year for five years)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
92,The Dalmore Quintessence,45.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Quintessence is the first single malt to have undergone secondary maturation in five different types of California red wine casks: zinfandel, pinot noir, syrah, merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sweet sherry, ripe cherries, marzipan, and white pepper on the nose. Rich and mouth-coating; strong flavor of thick-cut orange marmalade, <em>oloroso</em> sherry, malt, and milk chocolate. The finish features gentle warming spice and lingering Jaffa orange. Plain chocolate and orange notes seem as though they are never going to end! £1,000",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
92,Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1990,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,615,"The first release in Glenmorangie’s new Vintage Collection, named Bond House No.1 after the 19<sup>th</sup> century warehouse that became the distillery’s new stillhouse in 1990. Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Mandarins, honey, and vanilla on the floral nose. Very smooth on the palate, with malt, vanilla, more honey, and milk chocolate orange. Attractive soft oak notes and gentle herbal spice in the medium to long finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
92,Tamdhu Batch Strength No. 002,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"The first Batch Strength expression of Tamdhu appeared in 2015 and was also matured entirely in sherry casks and not chill filtered. Big, sweet sherry notes on the nose, with vanilla, sultanas, maraschino cherries, and Turkish Delight. Rich and full-bodied, with <em>oloroso</em> sherry, milk chocolate, vanilla, dates, ripe cherries, sweet oak, and allspice. The finish is sweet and long, with lingering, lively spices. A very quaffable, well-priced dram for sherry bomb lovers.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2017
92,"High West A Midwinter Nights Dram (Act 4, Scene 5)",,Rye Whiskey,80,"A blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Gobs of fruit (red and black raspberry, plum, dried citrus) and crisp mint on a bed of caramel and vanilla. Lingering cinnamon and fruit on the finish. Distinctive and impressive.",John Hansell,Spring 2017
92,Templeton Rye Special Reserve 10 year old,,Rye Whiskey,150,"Spicy and pleasantly sweet. Vibrant too, with cinnamon, peppermint stick, and caramel corn. Warming spice zing on the finish. Quite possibly at its peak age for flavor, maturity, and balance.",John Hansell,Spring 2017
92,WhistlePig The Boss Hog III: The Independent 14 year old,,Canadian,300,"So much wood, so beautifully integrated into dry straw, black fruits, and tart, pink grapefruit juice. Dry, with a farmy earthiness, and like the scotch hogsheads it was finished in, bigger than life. Icing sugar, red wine, and floral perfume. WhistlePig was the original U.S.-bottled Canadian 100% flavoring rye and after 4 years flexing in Vermont its muscles are enormous.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2017
92,Kavalan Solist Pedro Ximénez Cask,,Taiwanese Whisky,699,"Damson jam, herbal undertones, banana leaf, scallions, and clean, fresh oak notes. Burst of red fruit; raspberry, strawberry, rosehip, and sherry with lips tingling from the PX spices, citrus enters the fray, then chewy butter toffees. Wonderful complexity and flavor trajectory, it rounds off on a strawberry note. It is great to find a heavyweight whisky that is perfectly approachable at cask strength. The finish stays juicy, with vibrant spices. (502 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
92,Kavalan Ex-Bourbon Cask Strength Single Cask,,Taiwanese Whisky,175,"Delicately complex. Dried vanilla, pineapple, toasted coconut, tangerine, and cream. A kiss of honey and polished oak on the finish. Quite lovely and very versatile; it would make a delicious pre-dinner dram. (<em>Julio’s Liquors and Loch &amp; K(e)y exclusive</em>)",John Hansell,Spring 2017
92,Stalk & Barrel Rye (cask 56),,Canadian,95,"Stalk &amp; Barrel cask strength 100% rye whisky takes rye into innovative new flavor territory. Rye spices, rose water, vanilla, earthy tones, and dark rye bread on first nosing are all typical of rye. However, once it broadens into linen, oilcloth, linseed oil, high fruity esters, malt, and breakfast cereal (Weetabix?) it’s all wonderfully original. A real honey barrel. Dang!",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2017
92,Yellowstone Limited Edition Bourbon 7 year old (2016 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"A blend of 7 and 12 year old bourbons, married in new toasted barrels. Vanilla, caramel-coated berries, orchard fruit, cinnamon, soft mint, and teasing toasted coconut-spiked chocolate. Dry, spicy oak finish. Nicely integrated. Excellent combination of youth and maturity.",John Hansell,Spring 2017
92,Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,24,"Think of walking in a prairie meadow at a state fair, the wind curving slight hints of grain, and then an explosion of cotton candy, marshmallow, and florals. Initial earth turns to powerful notes of smoked paprika, maple, salted caramel, and fried bread. Every note is pronounced and beautiful. A strong and long finish follows with an amalgamation of everything tasted, and then cinnamon appears out of nowhere. <em>(Kentucky only)</em>",Fred Minnick,Spring 2017
92,Benromach 1974 (cask 1583),,Single Malt Scotch,1600,"This 41 year old single cask was aged in a sherry butt and interacted magnificently with that wood. The nose offers peeled red apples, sultanas, honey, fudge, milk chocolate, and American cream soda. Balanced and harmonious throughout, the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits, pipe tobacco, black pepper, and ginger. Long in the finish, with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate, and slightly smoky, unobtrusively tannic oak. A 1970s classic!",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
92,Tomatin 1971 Warehouse 6 Collection,,Single Malt Scotch,4000,"This 44 year old was matured in <i>oloroso</i> casks before being bottled at cask strength in May 2016. Mellow, sherried fruit on the nose, with rose hips, vanilla fudge, almond, honey, and slightly earthy spices. The fragrant palate features an intense blast of ripe fruit, caramel, and sweet spices, while resin develops in time. The medium-length finish offers plain chocolate, raisins, and prunes, with no negative tannins. One of the best Tomatins to date.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2016
92,Jack Daniel’s 150th Anniversary,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"There’s a lot going on here, and it starts in an unusual place—corn, specifically corn husk, followed by caramel, vanilla, oak, banana, pineapple, <span class=""s1"">crème brûlée</span>, vanilla, a hint of cedar, cherrywood, sautéed porcini mushroom, and cinnamon. Over a mouth coating texture, the velvety structure drips down the jawline, offering butterscotch, paprika, nutmeg, baked apple pie, bread pudding, caramel chew, roasted walnuts, and baking spice, which lingers over a long finish. Must-have Tennessee whiskey. Price is per liter.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2016
92,Yoichi Single Malt,45.0,Japanese,80,"Yoichi age statements are gone for now, but if the whisky stays this good, I can live with that. Black earthy peat, smoldering fires, a turned-out pocket of briny seashells, whole lime, lemon twist, sugared orange, ground ginger, and licorice. Silky smooth, with light, fruity sweetness developing into tangy Spangles, kiwi, and lime juice. The smoky peat is the weft woven through the fruit structure’s warp. The finish is insanely long: menthol, peat, and leather.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2016
92,Compass Box The Circus,49.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,275,"Ringmaster John Glaser’s latest Big Top attraction: the nose juggles dark marmalade, almonds, sweet sherry, dates, and dried pineapple. Flavors swing like a trapeze between deep orange, dried tropical fruits, nuts, and chocolate, with the silky composure of a seal balancing a ball on its nose. Ridiculously smooth; if you’re looking for burn, try fire eating instead. Knife throwers accurately pinpoint the finish: fruit, (thud) chocolate (thud), spice (THUD). In this manner, Mr. G. will challenge the world! (2,490 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
92,1792 Full Proof,,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"No age statement on the label, but aged for 8 1/2 years. Bottled at the same ABV as its entry proof into the barrel. Lush and mouth-coating. A pleasingly sweet bourbon, with caramel, nougat, and chewy toffee, mixed with ripe orchard fruit, golden raisin, and creamy vanilla. Soothing finish. A wonderful way to end a meal. (With a cigar, perhaps?) This is a beautiful bourbon and a great value given its quality, ABV, and price.",John Hansell,Fall 2016
92,Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve (No. 3405),60.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Think caramel bomb. Once you pass the crème brûlée, caramel chew, and other variations of the confectionary, vanilla custard, pumpkin, toasted pecan, raisins, light German chocolate cake, praline, tobacco, cigar box, sandalwood, and earth surface. It’s mouth-coating, covering every inch, tingling from the palate’s roof to the back of the neck. The incredibly long finish sits there with caramel. The only knock here is that caramel can be overwhelming, but it’s also bourbon’s staple note. <em>(New Hampshire only)</em>",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
92,William Grant Rare Cask Reserves Ghosted Reserve 21 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,140,"A purity and fragility rarely encountered, with aromas as fleeting as footprints on wet sand: marshmallow, meringue, honey, and rose petals. A delicacy to the structure brings banana, caramel, spun sugar, and orange peel. The oak spices build slowly, making the lips throb from the inside. It’s an elaborate maze of ethereal suggestion and an apparition of calm beauty. It atrophies reluctantly, leaving tangy peels and lengthy sweetness anchored by spicy base notes. (12,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
92,Limeburners Barrel Strength Heavy Peat,61.0,Australian Whisky,539,"Burning driftwood, crisp bacon fat, and melting asphalt in a heat wave cut through with vanilla cream, butterscotch, and chocolate ganache. Great Southern distillery has unleashed a multidimensional beast that opens innocently with vanilla and honey, quickly blown away by a blast of salt and pepper before a deep, primeval base of peat and spice well up from the depths of your soul. Amazingly, great tenderness even at this strength, with a long, complex finish of smoke, sweetness, and spice. A$700",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2016
92,Booker’s Rye,,Rye Whiskey,300,"Is this perfect? From the look and nose, yes. Rich caramel and campfire smoke early on; it’s robust, but balanced. Crème brûlée with a sultry smokiness, raw honey with a dusting of nutmeg and a Scotch ale malt profile that’s creamy and mouth-coating. Alas, a heavy bite hides much, needing water to open up. A drop adds complexity, spice, vanilla, chocolate, and licorice.",Fred Minnick,Fall 2016
92,Lock Stock & Barrel Straight Rye 16 year old,,Canadian,150,"Another Lock Stock &amp; Barrel all rye-grain whisky from the pot still at Alberta Distillers. To the sweet oak caramels, vanilla, and potent spiciness of new charred American oak barrels, it adds spring flowers, blistering black pepper, and blackstrap molasses. Firewood, Smith Brothers black cough drops, and new leather bring dimension to ever-present cloves and egg-noggy nutmeg. Canada balsam, licorice, cherries, clean oak, and the heat of high proof, then a long, hot, sweet and spicy finish with vegetal undertones.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2016
92,Midleton 1991 Single Cask,,Irish Single Pot Still,356,"From this first-fill bourbon cask emerge light, delicate, aromatic fruits: think white peach, poached pear, and lychee with creamed coconut, nutmeg-spiced latte, Simnel cake, Chinese five-spice, and richer apple notes. A seemingly chaste dram that begins with honey, egg-washed brioche, stewed pears, and slender pink rhubarb before innocence is lost as sweet bursts of fruit explode, while dark vanilla, clove, rum and raisin, chocolate, and rye divert the action. Dried apple with Christmas spices marks the finish. (186 bottles,<em> The Whisky Exchange only</em>) £245",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
92,Redbreast All Sherry Single Cask,,Irish Single Pot Still,261,"First you think you love Redbreast, and then they go and release a triple-distilled single pot still sherry single cask from 1999. Coffee beans, chocolate buttons, nougat, wet leather jackets, macaroon, and black bananas. A sweet sherry baptism of fresh fig fruit and dark toffee, with blackened char wriggling delightfully under the tongue. Thick and oily, a savory tone surfaces, closed by coffee and heavy clove. Chicory coffee and licorice finish. Epic: extroverted northern cardinal to the chirpy European robin. (576 bottles,<em> The Whisky Exchange only</em>) £180",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
92,The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 30 year old 1984,,Single Grain Whisky,152,"The nose is bathed in aromas of lime, bergamot, lychee, and fresh pineapple cores. This is delicate, refined, and complex, with touches of fragrant spices and a calming influence of oak. A web of citrus strands, barley sugar, and toffee is shot through by wood spices and surpassed by a delicious butterscotch flavor that continues into the finish.  Effortless, relaxed, and brilliant whisky, and quite frankly, I’m not sure you could find better 30 year old whisky at this price. £106",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
92,The Five Distinguished and Rare 39 year old,51.0,Single Grain Whisky,216,"This is massive. It even pours thickly, as the aromas spill out of the glass: rich stewed apple, dry oak, a passing <em>digestif</em> trolley wobbling with dark sticky bottles, and currants on the tummy of a gingerbread man. There is a rum-like quality to the thick texture that lands squarely on the palate, bursting out with sweet apple and brown sugar. It hardly loses its grip after swallowing, dissipating almost imperceptibly against the approaching oak flavors. Special indeed. (330 bottles,<em> WoodWinters Wines &amp; Whiskies only</em>) £150",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2016
92,Chivas Regal 18 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,99,"It rarely gets better than this. Vanilla, almond slice, toffee, pencil shavings, sweet oak, and mild wood spices on the nose. Effortlessly smooth and delicate, this warms up gradually, with malt, dark fudge, leather, raisin, and tobacco notes before the wood spices, oak, and chocolate take center stage, ending with a warm, lengthy finish. This must be master blender Colin Scott’s most preciously guarded recipe. The man’s a genius!",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
92,Elijah Craig Single Barrel (No. 4040) 18 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Back after a three-year hiatus. Well-rounded, with lovely caramel, creamy vanilla, toasted oak, nougat, and candied fruit, along with a peppering of cinnamon and subtle mint. Pleasant, lingering finish. Great structure with seamless flavors.",John Hansell,Spring 2016
92,Big Peat Christmas Edition 2015,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,70,"Marginally less aggressive than in 2014, this Big Peat is more rounded and exhibits greater finesse. Overall, it’s a better whisky. The invasive smoke still infiltrates the skull and clasps your brain tightly. A sweet smoke of smoldering hillside wildfire extinguished by rubber beaters, balanced by meadow flowers, tree blossom, and honey. Sticky lemons smeared in thick honey, cracked black pepper, and a fabulous, almost gelatinous texture, it builds solidly in peaty intensity. Knockout! A hot, smoky finish like dragon’s breath.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2016
92,Wyoming Barrel Strength Bourbon (Barrel 443),58.0,Craft Whiskey,199,"An authoritative nose: deep oak structure, cracked corn, warehouse reek. Minty and lively, but deep and almost ponderous at the same time, and not anywhere near as hot as expected. A bare hint of mustiness (which a bit of water helps wash out) keeps it from being truly exceptional, but this verges on greatness. A show-stopper.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2016
92,Compass Box This Is Not A Luxury Whisky,,Blended Scotch Whisky,225,"This surrealist Compass Box whisky mimics the dimensional challenges of Magritte’s “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” by raising questions about the luxury pretensions of whisky. Is it the expense? Packaging? Good taste? Masquerading behind a green apple, a bowler-hatted John Glaser smiles enigmatically. Sultanas, charcoal smoke, toffee, chocolate, sea salt, and warm sherry tones. The alcohol rides with dense black cherry, cacao nibs, Colombian coffee, and dark fruits. Trails of smoking fruitcake finish the experience. Above all, buy and consume. (4,992 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2015
92,Thomas H. Handy Rye,,Rye Whiskey,80,"Distilled in 2008, this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection. The boldest and spiciest too! A blast of mint, clove, and cinnamon leads the spice charge, with fig, dates, caramel-coated nuts, vanilla, and candied fruit. Well-integrated flavors, and a smart balance of youth and maturity. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
92,Compass Box Hedonism Quindecimus,46.0,Grain Scotch Whisky,200,"How time flies! This eloquent blended grain marks CBWC’s 15<sup>th</sup> anniversary and the combination of these aged grains is idiosyncratic of whisky auteur John Glaser’s distinctive taste. Rich honey, apricot stone, crisp spices, vanilla custard, gentle oak char, and tropical fruits promise a real reward. Succulently juicy, with melon, apple, and caramel, subtly paced, with chocolate and dark fruit infiltrating. Slowly the sweetness depletes to black pepper and spiced roast meats. Defer swallowing for as long as possible. (<em>5,689 bottles</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2015
92,Bernheim Original Single Barrel 7 year old Straight Wheat,45.0,Wheat Whiskey,35,"This select bottling of Bernheim Original comes from Warehouse Y on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor, and is non-chill filtered. Without the filtering, the nose is notably more expressive and becomes a real showcase for wheat grain, oak spice, caramel, and citrus. On the palate, this whiskey maintains a firm balance between soft and strong, with supple wheat grain entwined with caramel, oak, and cinnamon spice. A long, flavorful finish caps off a well-curated selection of an excellent whiskey. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
92,Buffalo Trace French Oak Barrel Head Aged,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Nicely round flavor profile, with complex notes of creamy vanilla, subtle tropical fruit, mocha, fennel seed, and light tobacco. Lingering cinnamon spice and cocoa on the finish. An extremely drinkable whiskey that entertains throughout. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Fall 2015
92,Oban Little Bay,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Finally, an unimpeachable counterpoint to the rally cry against no age statement whisky. Oban Little Bay is everything that Oban 14 is, and more. A rich, fruity, malty nose showcases dried apricot, dark chocolate, and salt. On the palate, Little Bay explodes with flavor, combining malt with orange, chocolate, and blackberry. Clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate, which shows superb balance and integration. A long, slightly dry, citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
92,Nikka Coffey Grain,45.0,Japanese,65,"Sweet, with subtle, crisp, nutty oak, then comes fudge, ripe banana, and peach. The overall effect is like eating vanilla ice cream with toffee fudge and hazelnut sprinkles. The structure is thick and physical, the palate sweet and quite fat, with light hints of raspberry, fruit salad. A jag of acidity freshens the delivery on the finish. With water there’s more toffee, and it becomes slightly more yielding, with less oak. For me the gold standard of grain.",Dave Broom,Fall 2015
92,Canadian Rockies 21 year old (batch 2),46.0,Canadian,53,"When Thomas Chen introduced Canadian Rockies in Taiwan, he chose Highwood Distillers in High River, Alberta, to supply a delicate yet fragrant, fruit-laden whisky that would please the Taiwanese palate. Now launching in Canada, Chen upped the bottling strength to 46% to boost the flavor. The complex, exotic fruit salad and faint lilac-like flowers that characterized the original remain, along with blistering white pepper, sweet oak caramels, and crisp, clean barrel notes on a luxurious, creamy palate. <em>(Canada only) </em>C$69",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2015
92,Barrell Whiskey (Batch 001),,Miscellaneous,59,"7 year old whiskey (an unspecified “corn, rye, and malted barley” mashbill “distilled in Indiana”) aged in used barrels. Maple syrup, well-browned popovers, and Canada mint lozenges in a boozy-hot nose. Richly sweet on the palate: pastry dough, hints of anise, buttery and slightly-burnt cornbread, syrupy dark fruits: complex, rich, delicious. Water brings out more of the dough and tames the heat. Delicious, unique, intriguing. Sourced whiskey.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2015
92,Canadian Club 1960s,40.0,Canadian,126,"Fifty years on, the standard Canadian Club becomes very complex and in-your-face delicious. Barley sugar sweetness blossoms into creamy caramel in a dark, heavy, full-bodied whisky with cinnamon, hot chewing tobacco, and sizzling spice. Acetone, dry wood, and peaches on the nose give way to musty perfumed sandalwood and fresh crisp oak, with glowing embers in the throat. Floral, sweet, and a bit nutty, it finishes slowly in leather and furniture polish. <em>(Australia only) </em>A$164",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
92,Spirit of Hven Sankt Claus,,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,110,"Handpicked from over 100 casks, this is a belter! Puréed prune, dunnage, black licorice, clove, coffee bean, and raisin-studded chocolate. It’s like scorched earth after a wildfire. There is a syrupy, dark rum-like sweetness, a medley of cinnamon, cocoa, raisin, and vanilla essence. Water flushes out some gentle smoke and adds smoothness, but by god, it’s wonderful neat. The best yet from Spirit of Hven. (294 bottles) 975 SEK",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
92,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old wheated bourbon from floor #9,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.



Darker, more intense and mysterious in personality when compared to its two siblings. Notes of barrel char, roasted nuts, polished oak, and tobacco, peppered with dried spice. Fortunately, sweet notes of toffee, maple syrup, and caramel stand up to the dry notes and provide balance. Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Spring 2015
92,Glenfiddich Rare Oak 25 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,383,"A classic mature ‘Fiddich nose, that mix of chocolate, sweet fruits, and funkiness. Dried apples, a little currant, but also a pure thread of sweetness. In time, a little fresh mushroom. Complex. Soft on the tongue, so you need to concentrate on what’s happening. Later becomes minty, with supple tannins and a little artichoke on the finish. Water needs to be handled carefully to bring out green herbal notes. I’d probably keep water on the side. Excellent. <em>(Travel Retail only) </em>£250",Dave Broom,Spring 2015
92,Tomintoul Reserve 37 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,600,"Not what you’d expect from a malt at this age. Instead of oak dominating the nose, it&#039;s citrus in focus, with orange marmalade, candied orange, and even orange blossom. On the palate this whisky is light and delicate, leading with the citrus notes from the nose. This symphony of orange is followed with toffee, ginger, oak, and <em>rancio</em> in a combination that&#039;s well balanced and integrated. Unique for its age, a definite treat for those who prefer lighter and more delicate whiskies. (<em>U.S. only, 600 bottles</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Spring 2015
92,Blue Hanger 11th Limited Release,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,137,"It’s the intensity of flavor that just grabbed me by the lapels and spun me round. It harbors intense tangelo juiciness; that unparalleled concentration of deep citrus skillfully mingled with dark vanilla, dried apricots, and gentle smoke. This goes the distance, delivering wave after delicious wave: peach juice, mandarin, pineapple cubes, and lemon zest. A firm, unctuous finish shows a little charred wood and dark sugar cloaked in fine smoke. Tongue pleasing and very special indeed. £90",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2015
92,Lost Prophet 22 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"The fourth release (and best so far) in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series. This bourbon was distilled at what was then called the George T. Stagg distillery (now Buffalo Trace) and spent the last several years maturing at Stitzel-Weller. It’s nicely balanced and not over-oaked, with spice (clove, cinnamon), oak resin, and leather, along with sweet notes (honeyed fruit, soft vanilla, coconut custard) and a nice creamy texture. Better than most 20-plus year old bourbons on the market.",John Hansell,Spring 2015
92,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1988 (Cask #434),,Single Malt Scotch,580,"Quite earthy, with orris root, burlap, and dunnage warehouse notes.  Distinctly meaty—Bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. This untamed edge—think Mortlach or Benrinnes—dominates the palate, but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. There’s espresso on the finish. Here’s Glenfarclas taking a ramble on the wild side. If your preference is for more robust styles, then look no further. £345",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
92,Benjamin Prichard’s Tennessee Whiskey,40.0,Craft Whiskey,45,"Although the Prichard distillery is located in Lincoln County, it has a special exemption from using the Lincoln County Process and isn’t charcoal filtered.  The nose reflects that with bright aromas including caramel, cinnamon, and oak. The entry is sweet caramel corn followed by soft cinnamon and black pepper with a boost from some oak. A medium, slightly dry finish completes a very flavorful but still extremely easy-drinking Tennessee whiskey. This is the crown jewel of the Prichard distillery line.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2014
92,The Feathery,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,66,"Chocolate-covered raisins scoffed on a heathery moor, leather riding tack, intense plain chocolate, malt loaf, mixed nuts, Medjool dates, and traces of wood ash. A gorgeous, unctuous mouthfeel with flavors spun around bright sparks of orange, dark toffee, and rich maltiness, melding to black cherry, stewed fruits, licorice, and charred oak. Named for the leather golf balls packed with goose feathers used in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. Sink one for a birdie. From the bottlers of Sheep Dip. £39",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2014
92,Baker’s,,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Rich, multi-layered nose: vanilla, cornmeal, berries (black raspberries, wineberries), and broad-shouldered oak. Powerful, but not overproof hot in the mouth; controlled. The berries sing a high counter-melody over the corn-oak beat as the whole experience rocks along. It’s powerful, sweet, authoritative, and finishes with a reprise of it all: berries, corn, vanilla, and stronger oak. Mature, complete bourbon with a 7 year age statement, and a real sleeper in the Small Batch Collection.",Lew Bryson,Fall 2014
92,Crown Royal XO,40.0,Canadian,45,"A rich luxurious whisky finished in cognac casks, as was the crisper, brighter Cask No. 16 that it replaces. This is the cedary, leathery, tobacco-ish sipping whisky of the private club. Simple toffee and the cherry essence of <em>Beaujolais nouveau</em> evolve into ripe red apples and heavy, dusky, dark fruit with candied citrus peel, bitter almond skins, and hints of oak. Sizzling gingery spice and white pepper linger over textured sandalwood. Defined by its heavy, creamy body.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2014
92,Compass Box Orangerie,40.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,45,"Compass Box takes a fresh approach to flavored whisky by infusing Navalino oranges and spices into a blend of Highland single malt and single grain whisky. Bright and slightly bitter orange peel combines with vanilla, honey, and malt. The grain whisky gives nice support and structure along with black pepper, cinnamon, and clove spice. Great balance between the whisky and flavoring in a flavored whisky that is much more dry than sweet. Finally, a flavored whisky to get really excited about.",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
92,Compass Box Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Limited Edition,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,130,"Peat Monster is a staple Compass Box blended malt whisky, but this raises the bar significantly. The nose is “as you were”: peat reek, seaside, very Islay. But on the palate John Glaser&#039;s added some peaty Highland whisky—probably a signature Clynelish—to add a hint of licorice, a softer, fruitier smoke base, and through some virgin French oak, a delightful spiciness. Compass Box is in a purple patch. Again.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
92,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Extended Stave Drying Time,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Richer and fuller when compared to the Standard Stave Drying Time variant in this Experimental Collection. Sweeter too, with creamy layers of vanilla and caramel. The extended drying time influence tames the dried spice and oak resin and is proof that extended stave aging really benefits older bourbons that might otherwise be dominated by oak. Sadly, with whiskey in such demand, I doubt many bourbon producers will take the time to age the staves longer. Price per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Spring 2014
92,Aberfeldy 16 year old Single Cask (Cask No. 5),,Single Malt Scotch,250,"From a sherry cask. Bright and lively. Quite fruity, with notes of golden raisin, pineapple, nectarine, and tangerine. The fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel. A dusting of vanilla, cinnamon, and hint of cocoa, with black licorice on the finish. Lush and mouth-coating. The best of the Aberfeldy whiskies I’ve tasted to date. <i>(New Hampshire only)</i>",John Hansell,Spring 2014
92,Glengoyne 35 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,4640,"Glengoyne 35 year old has been aged in sherry casks and just 500 decanters have been released. The nose offers sweet sherry, maraschino cherries, honey, sponge cake, marzipan, and soft fudge, turning to caramel in time, with a whiff of worn leather. Slick in the mouth, with spicy dried fruit, and more marzipan and cherries. Long in the finish with plain chocolate cherry liqueur; still spicy. Finally a buttery, bourbon-like note. No negative cask connotations in this well-balanced after-dinner dram.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
92,Signatory (distilled at Laphroaig) 1998,,Single Malt Scotch,166,"Any sherried Laphroaig is welcome, and this does not disappoint. Rich, resinous, medicinal, with underlying soft fruits, the smoke is all-pervading, but never dominant. In other words, it isn’t just complex and balanced, but has that other dimension which elevates it in mind (and marks). With water, there’s antiseptic cream mingling with oxidized fruits and nuts; think <i>manzanilla pasada</i>. The palate shows storm clouds gathering over Texa. Rich dried fruits, cacao, and a ferny lift on the finish. Fantastic. (The Whisky Exchange only)  £100",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
92,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Longmorn) 28 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,250,"The nose is fascinating, as if dust is cohering into form, and fruity form at that. When it emerges there’s baked banana, fruitcake, citrus peels, passion fruit, mango, mace flower, and nutmeg. A mossy edge anchors it to earth. Even livelier with water, this is a superbly balanced, mature whisky. The palate is pure, with big retronasal impact of the spice. Layered and long, it’s at its best neat; you need the intensity to amplify all the complexity. Superb.",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
92,Talisker 1985,,Single Malt Scotch,600,"This 27 year old Talisker has been aged in refill American oak casks, and the nose offers brine, wood smoke, wet tarry rope, slightly medicinal, with the emergence of milk chocolate. Big-bodied, with lots of peat accompanied by chili and smoked bacon, with sweeter notes of malt, fudge, and apple. A hint of fabric Elastoplast. Long in the finish, with rock pools, bonfire ash, and sweet, tingling spice notes which carry to the very end. A powerful beast, even by Talisker standards. <i>(3,000 bottles).</i>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
92,Amrut 100 (U.S. release),,Indian Whisky,170,"The whisky gets its name from the fact that 57.1% ABV is 100 proof in the British measuring system: the alcohol concentration needed to sustain flaming gunpowder. It comes in 100 cl bottles and only 100 bottles are being released in each territory. This malt takes no prisoners, with big, bold flavors dominated by peat, but with chutney-style fruit and an array of spice making for a rich, intense taste experience.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
92,Exclusive Blend 1991 21 year old,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,100,"From whisky connoisseur David Stirk&#039;s Exclusive Malts Single Cask Cask Strength range, this is a blend made with 80% malt, and it shows. This is a beauty. It&#039;s also a ‘traffic light’ whisky, with the sort of whisky <em>rancio</em> associated with the oldest whiskies up front, peaches and cream and pureed fruit in the center, and changing to oaky spiciness late on. Whisky with body, depth, and balance, which morph seamlessly. Very good indeed.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
92,Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 90,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,47,"Elegant, subtly complex, and perilously drinkable. Honey tones dovetail nicely with gentle oak spice and bright fruit. My favorite of the bunch. Very lovely! Price is per 375 ml.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
92,Parker’s Heritage Collection Promise of Hope 10 year old,48.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"From a single barrel, but the barrel number is (unfortunately) not specified. It’s nicely matured, deftly balanced, and complex, with a wide range of fruit, layered sweetness, and a cabinet full of spice, especially mint. Easy to drink—I’m enjoying it immensely without adding any water—and deceptively beautiful; there are no fancy bells or whistles here. Great bourbon, honoring a great master distiller.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
92,Blue Hanger 7th Release Limited Edition,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,100,"What a success story. After six releases in a decade, there have been three just this year. This release is especially for the States, and it's a fireball. There are dried fruits and dusty bookshelves on the nose, and tropical fruits with water. On the palate it's a big, peaty, rich whisky with licorice and more of the pineapple, kiwifruit, and guava. You get the whole fairground in the finale, with candy, fruit, and smoke. Excellent.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
92,Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2013 Release),60.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Thirteen years old, but it shows its age nicely. It’s peppered with complex dried spice notes (mint, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla),

yet it also has interwoven sweet notes (maple syrup, caramel, honey) to keep the whiskey from being too dry. Hints of dark chocolate and berried fruit add complexity. Dry, spicy, tobacco, and leather-tinged finish. Great complexity!",John Hansell,Fall 2013
92,Lagavulin Feis Ile 2013 bottling (distilled 1995),51.0,Single Malt Scotch,152,"Though quiet to start, the impression is of a fog of smoke, balled up within a dunnage

warehouse, ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized

nuttiness. The palate is where it shows its class: mature, slowly unfolding and

layered, with Latakia tobacco, menthol, nori, white pepper, pear, and a massive,

tarry Bohea Souchong tea element on the finish. Everything from Lagavulin is

touched with gold at the moment. Try to find a bottle. <i>(distillery only) </i>£99",Dave Broom,Fall 2013
92,The Exclusive Malts 22 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1990 vintage (Cask #10866),,Single Malt Scotch,250,"Clean and complex, showing a matured, somewhat restrained personality for Laphroaig: less medicinal, but more rounded. Tar, pencil shavings, anise, honeyed citrus, Spanish olive brine, and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla, caramel, and light nougat. Lingering, satisfying finish. Frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled Laphroaigs? Look no further. Delicious!",John Hansell,Fall 2013
92,Alberta Premium Dark Horse,45.0,Canadian,30,"For six decades, Alberta Premium has been one of Canada’s favorite economy-brand mixers. Floral, herbal, and fruity, with charcoal and wet slate, this new addition to the lineup is clearly meant for connoisseurs. While the original is made entirely from rye grain, Dark Horse beefs up the flavor and body with a dollop of corn whisky and a sherry finish, creating a vanilla-rich symphony of pepper, hot ginger, pickle juice, and crisp, clean oak. C$30",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
92,Big Peat Small Batch,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"The original Big Peat was a mix of smoky Islay malts and was already up there with the very best competition in the category, even though many of the others were bottled at cask strength. I scored it at 90. Now it’s back to play in the big boys' pool with a killer cask strength whisky of its own. This is to whisky what AC/DC is to heavy rock: old school, predictable, but great and exactly what fans want.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
92,Compass Box Flaming Heart 2012 Edition,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"In my book, the bar can&#039;t be set much higher than it is for Flaming Heart and this latest version doesn&#039;t disappoint, though it does head off into a scuzzier, grittier, and more peaty direction than the 10th anniversary bottling, and has lost some of the black currant fruitiness in the process. No matter: this smolders with peaty and fishy intensity, works its way round to tinned strawberries, damson, and berry fruits, and emerges sooty and smoky. A BIG whisky.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
92,Compass Box Great King Street New York Blend,45.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"The original Great King Street blend was all sweet lemon and spice. This is something else again. This is a gutsy, urban wise guy of a whisky, rich in peat, with distinctive malty flavors—all in all, closer to a malt than a blend. That's because of the high malt content, and only the rounded edges and soft finish are gilded by grain. Some fruit and spice emerge through the peat, but the smoke's what you remember—a master class in blending.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
92,Lagavulin 21 year old 2012 Special Release,52.0,Single Malt Scotch,624,"Lagavulin from a first-fill sherry butt? There’s unusual. This is huge, fluxing, and complex, mixing saddles and dark chocolate, pu-erh tea and smothered kiln, geranium and velvet, gamey venison and treacle. The smoke is integrated, the fires ember-like, the oak there but not oppressively so. Massive, dense, layered, and complex, this needs time to open. In short, a distillation of Islay and up alongside last year’s Jazz Festival bottling.",Dave Broom,Winter 2012
92,Talisker 35 year old Special Release 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Talisker is a Special Releases favorite, and this bottling, the oldest ever marketed by the distillery, is actually the sixteenth. Distillation was in 1977, and maturation has taken place in both American and European oak refill casks. Soft wood smoke, sultana, nutmeg, and chili powder on the nose. Dried fruits, vanilla, and malt merge with more chili and savory notes, plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. A touch of brine, orange peel, and bonfire in the finish. 3,090 bottles. ",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
92,Thomas H. Handy Sazerac,,Rye Whiskey,,"Full-throttle rye, bottled uncut and unfiltered. Bold spice notes (cinnamon, allspice, mint), lush fruit (ripe orchard fruit, golden raisin), orange liqueur, and subtle coconut, all on a bed of caramel and honeyed vanilla. Clean and uncluttered. This isn’t a one-trick pony. It’s the sweetness and fruit that accompany the rye spice that makes this whiskey so attractive.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
92,Glann ar Mor September 2012,46.0,French Whisky,,"Glann ar Mor is a rising star in the world of whisky, one of three very impressive distilleries in the Brittany region in Northern France, and this new single malt, fresh from the cask at the back end of September, is its finest release yet. A mixture of soft tinned fruits, especially sweet pears in syrup, sweet vanilla ice cream, and a delicate but assertive earthy underbed make this an utter delight. Magnifique. €57",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
92,Glenglassaugh 37 year old,56.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"A first-fill sherry cask bottling (one cask, exclusive to North America). Some of the old Glenglassaugh whiskies can be very delicious, and this is one of them. It's very clean, lush, and fruity (bramble, citrus, golden raisin), with a kiss of honey, toffee, and soft spice. Elegantly sherried; it’s never cloying. A very nice whisky from a quality cask that tastes more like 21 or 25 years old than 37. (I mean this in a good way.) ",John Hansell,Fall 2012
92,Blue Hanger 4th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"This Blue Hanger has sherry and fruit on the nose, but it's all reined in. Then the palate is big, rich, complex, and fruity, and late oakiness from some 30 year-plus malt in the mix brings the perfect finale. £61",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
92,Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glen Grant) 60 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Rich gold. Superb mature nose with subtle whisky rancio, mixing fragrant mango with a little mint, rosewater, and waxiness; there’s even some custard and a whiff of woodsmoke before sandalwood brings back the exotic edge. The palate is delicate with an amazingly fresh acidity that becomes herbal (basil and tarragon). It’s late summer, when there’s a sense of the year turning, and you allow fond memories to gently wash over you. £7,800",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
92,Lagavulin 16 year old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Lagavulin is a classic example of how smoke isn’t a blunt instrument that covers everything in a fog, but an element that works with all the flavors produced in distillation and maturation. Lagavulin isn’t ‘smoky,’ its peat moves into a weird territory of Lapsang Souchong tea and pipe tobacco, fishboxes and kippers. It smells of laurel and light cereal, but is always sweet. The palate shows more creosote, with hints of kelp and a little touch of iodine. Complex.",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
92,Writers Tears Cask Strength Pot Still,53.0,Irish,,"Well, the name's spot on because at that price it definitely brought tears to this writer's eyes. What a shame, because the liquid is eye-watering, too, a stunning big bruiser of a whiskey that coats the mouth as berry and green fruits battle it out with oak, spice, and grain oils — the whiskey equivalent to one of singer Sinead O'Connor's rants — powerful, impressive, a little bitter and twisted, utterly unforgettable, and unmistakably Irish. €135  ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
92,George Dickel Barrel Select,43.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,46,"The star of the portfolio. A true sipping whisky with elegance and grace. Perhaps the best Tennessee whisky on the market. Honey-soaked corn bread, rhum agricole, ripe nectarine, and glazed citrus. Hint of mint, green tea, and cinnamon. Very polished.   ",John Hansell,Spring 2012
92,The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #2),,Single Malt Scotch,263,"A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie’s No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown, this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989, all of which are then ‘married’ in a large vat (aka a ‘tun’). There’s classic Balvenie honey, along with macadamia, pistachio, and caramelized fruits. As it opens, it shifts into a high-class gentleman’s cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent. £165",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
92,Highland Park 1971 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"One of two recent vintage releases, this 1971 example has been matured in seventeen Spanish oak casks, that yielded a total of 657 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with maple syrup, almonds, and sherry. Soft and insinuating. Becoming progressively smokier. Bold fruit and peat notes on the palate, plus oak, cloves, and dark chocolate notes. Peppery in the long finish, with subtle tannins and persistent citrus fruits. ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
92,Port Ellen 32 year old (11th release) Special Releases 2011,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Port Ellen’s make was usually filled into old casks to maximize its smoke when used young. To us, therefore, it’s Islay’s most austere malt, yet the guys who worked there all talk of its sweetness. Here, finally, is an example of that. Yes, there’s some wet slate and briny smoke, but it’s balanced by citrus, waxy fruits, and a central sweetness adding complexity. It might have taken a long time to get here, but it was worth the wait. (Editor's Choice)   ",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
92,Drambuie 15,43.0,Flavored Whisky & Liqueurs,,"Hugely different from the standard Drambuie: much more dryly herbal, and the whisky's right here in the nose...and yet, they are distinctly related in the base character of the herbs. The whisky is quite present — 15 year old Speyside malts shine like the sun on rippling water — but the flavors of Drambuie are clear as well. Still sweet, but the whisky is much more the star. A Drambuie for us?",Lew Bryson,Spring 2012
92,Adelphi (distilled at Linkwood) 1984 26 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"There are light oaked notes to start, along with Oolong tea and very subtle smoke. These then shift into a mix of cedar and scented blossom. Classic, layered elegance with the cask offering support, not dominance. The fruits have that slightly eerie quality of decay, while the palate is deep and juicy. This is an exemplary, subtle, old whisky with delicate rancio (it’s a little cognac-like), which is given a boost of extra life with a small drop of water. £94",Dave Broom,Winter 2011
92,Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy,46.0,Irish Single Pot Still,218,"Like the man himself, this is altogether more considered and elegant, mixing whiskeys up to 25 years old for a complex and less bruising experience than the Powers. Instead, lemon and lime zest, kumquat, and blood orange entwine themselves around vanilla, nutmeg, and soft, drying tannins. No big knockout punches, but it goes the distance and wins unanimously and easily on points. €160 (Currently not available in the U.S.)",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
92,Ardbeg Alligator,,Single Malt Scotch,95,"Similar to the standard Ardbeg 10 year old, except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an “alligator” char). An aggressive whisky — even for Ardbeg — with a leathery texture throughout. Dynamic too, with coal tar, soot, bourbon barrel char, espresso, cocoa, licorice root, smoked fish, and a hint of ginger. There’s a nice creamy vanilla underbelly to balance the aggressiveness and (at least partially) muzzle the Alligator.",John Hansell,Fall 2011
92,The Macallan Royal Wedding,,Single Malt Scotch,240,"Rising above the tat issued to celebrate the nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton was this extremely limited (1,000 bottles) release from The Macallan. The nose is a mélange of rich fruits, marzipan, and beeswax/resin but it lifts with a drop of water to show apricot and heavy florals. The palate isn’t overly grippy, with more orange peel, almond, and characteristic oiliness. A malty/nutty smooth finish makes this a great one. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
92,Amrut Portonova,,Indian Whisky,,"This release is a port version of Amrut’s Intermediate Sherry — a sort of port pipe sandwich. The spirit is matured in both unused casks and bourbon casks, then spends a few months in port pipes, and then returns to bourbon casks. The result is a Pink Floyd show of a whisky: vibrant, colorful, complex, and nearly too much. A blackcurrant and wispy, smoky nose gives way to an intense and bittersweet mix of chili, blackcurrant, oak, damson, dark chocolate, and peat. Astounding. ",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
92,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1954,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. First-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic whisky rancio notes of cheese rind, sealing wax, and roasting pheasant. As it opens, there’s fig, some peat smoke, black cherry, and concentrated stone fruits. This exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. The finish is long, with apple skin, gingerbread, and walnut. A discreet nod to cognac. £1,250",Dave Broom,Summer 2011
92,Kavalan Solist Vinho Barrique Cask Strength,,Taiwanese Whisky,,"Kavalan is Taiwanese whisky from the King Car Company, and the progress its whiskeys are making is truly remarkable. With humidity roughly the same as Speyside — high — but the temperature more than 20° Fahrenheit  higher, maturation is on fast forward. This is just 4 years old, but it’s a monster mix of kumquat liqueur, tropical fruit, blackcurrant, and strawberry and cream candy. Later on some eastern spices, especially turmeric, bring it all back home. Remarkable. €70 Currently not available in the U.S.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
92,Mackinlay’s Rare Old Highland whisky,,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Rarely has a blend caused as much excitement as this one, but with good reason. This is also known as the Shackleton whisky, and is a recreation of the whisky abandoned in the Antarctic by explorer Ernest Shackleton more than 100 years ago. It has lemon, spring blossom, and wafts of smoke on the nose. The taste is full and citrusy, with peat and pepper in attendance. Beautifully balanced and outstanding, but there are just 50,000 bottles, so snap it up.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2011
92,Hirsch Rye,,Rye Whiskey,,"Enjoyable, dark sweet notes: molasses, maple syrup, fig, grilled corn. The spices are there, too (cool mint, cocoa powder, warming cinnamon, nutmeg). They’re well-rounded and show up more toward the finish (along with some tobacco and polished leather). Soft, reserved, and slightly past its prime, but it still maintains its dignity.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
92,Ardmore 100th Anniversary 12 year old,40.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"This isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary, incredibly a small amount is still available, and it is well worth pursuing.

Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret, cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers, and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter, it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on, but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again.

",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2011
92,BenRiach Pedro Ximinez Finish 1995 Vintage (Cask 7165),,Single Malt Scotch,95,"This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name, as Springbank does with Longrow, or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It’s also finished with the dark, lush “PX” sherry. Both influences are very evident, with the deep, heavy, earthy, smoky notes complemented by dark, fleshy, dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
92,The Dalmore,,Single Malt Scotch,,"A seductive Dalmore. Very fruity too, with Seville orange, peaches in syrup, clementine, pineapple, and bramble. Sugared almond, powdered vanilla, ginger, and lush sherry on the finish add depth and dimension. Consistent on the nose and palate, and with great balance. I’m glad they stopped the amoroso finishing when they did. I feel that any more sherry influence here would have been counterproductive. Very lovely!",John Hansell,Spring 2011
92,Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve,,Single Malt Scotch,375,"A special bottling to celebrate a major distillery expansion in 2010. So nice to see this whisky bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. Silky smooth, velvety texture. Creamy sweet foundation of vanilla fudge and caramel-coated almond. Plenty of fruit, too (golden raisin, honeyed peach, ripe nectarine, hint of banana bread). Richly textured, good weight (but not cloying), and the flavors combine seamlessly. A celebratory whisky indeed.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
92,Tomatin,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Aged in a refill American oak cask. Quite lively for its age, and the oak (surprisingly and happily) plays a supporting role rather than dominating. Creamy and mouth-coating, with vanilla wafer, coconut cream pie, caramel, nougat, and bright fruit (sultana, apricot, tangerine, and pineapple in syrup). Soothing finish. A very nice whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£450",John Hansell,Spring 2011
93,Crown Royal Noble Collection French Oak Cask Finished,40.0,Canadian,60,"The fourth in this series is finished in air-dried French oak. Hints of butterscotch become fruity, with tinges of vanilla as the nose opens. A luxurious creamy palate develops peppery spices that dissolve into a sweet fruitiness with a glowing warmth in the back of the throat. A dynamic dram with lovely hot spices that advance, then retreat. The long finish is mildly sweet and spicy. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
93,Johnnie Walker Ghost and Rare Glenury Royal Edition,,Blended Scotch Whisky,350,"This presents a mellow bouquet of rich dried fruits, peat smoke, baked sugar on puff pastry, and almond butter cups. The chocolate-orange signature note ebbs and flows, mingling with spices and clove, nuts, dried apricot, caramel, vanilla, and baked apple, ending with a frisson of spice and mild smoke. Understated elegance: this whisky is polished smooth as glass.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
93,Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Cornerstone Kentucky Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,175,"A delightfully complex nose of vanilla, hot cross buns and bakery shop, cherries, coconut, raisins, figs, licorice, old leather, and hay barn. A smooth, viscous palate offers lemon honey, fragrant oak, cigar ash, dark berries, and more coconut. Spicier notes emerge with water, while the finish offers rich smoothness, with spiciness, chocolate-covered coconut, tobacco, and bitter herbs. Lots of depth and complexity. A great whiskey to enjoy with a cigar.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
93,Woodford Reserve Batch Proof Straight Bourbon (2019 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"The nose offers fragrant orange, tea leaves, honey blossom, dried flowers, strawberry laces, and powdered sugar. The palate is surprisingly delicate, with notes of cigar ash, leather, blackberry preserves, vanilla milkshake, and balanced oak. The finish is long and rich, with dark fruit, cherry, strawberry, allspice, tobacco leaf, and polished oak. Water brings out toasty notes, cinnamon, clove, and strawberry preserves. Great depth, richness, and heat; stunningly formed.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
93,George Dickel 13 year old Bottled in Bond Straight Tennessee Whisky,50.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,36,"There’s so much peanut in this whiskey, it’s like standing in a JIF factory—but there’s also cracked corn, mixed berries, Coca-Cola, and fresh apples on the nose, along with weathered oak boards, and, when water is added, floral perfume. Powerful dense oak and cooked cherries, berries, and pomegranate on the palate, as well as cherry Popsicle and a heaping scoop of peanuts. The lengthy finish is rich with leathery oak, baking spice, roasted peanuts, and dark chocolate-covered cherries.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
93,Michter’s US*1 Barrel Strength Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 17E866),,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Exudes a tantalizing and heady aroma of baking spices, crème brûlée, and toasted oak, with Nilla Wafers and Jordan almonds lending confectionary notes. The oily mouthfeel and chewy viscosity are powerful yet balanced, as the lovely caramelized sweetness of grilled pound cake meets blackberry, lemon oil, ginger, and flickers of allspice. Focused and seamless in its rich tapestry of flavors. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
93,Balvenie 26 year old A Day of Dark Barley,,Single Malt Scotch,800,"This bottling from 1992 was distilled partly from dark-roasted chocolate malt. Classic Balvenie honey and fruit spices on the nose, with light oiliness, ginger, and orange blossom. Rich flavors of canned pears and pineapple in syrup on the palate, with hot chocolate and wood spices. Marzipan, dark chocolate, and black pepper in the long finish. A delightfully different Balvenie. (150 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
93,Glen Scotia 2003 Campbeltown Malts Festival Rum Cask Finished (2019 Release),,Single Malt Scotch,90,"The nose has sweet smoke and more prominent aromas of banana, vanilla, guava, papaya, jasmine, hibiscus, and citrus oil, with some salinity and chalky minerality. The palate is consistent: intense tropical fruit—guava, mango, coconut—plus hazelnut, smoked almonds, milk chocolate, and salty kelp. It finishes with smoked nuts, toasted tobacco, chalky minerality, dry oak, and persistent fruitiness. Lots to unpack here, and it develops beautifully with water—take your time.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
93,GlenDronach 27 year old Grandeur (Batch 10),,Single Malt Scotch,700,"The tenth limited release of Grandeur was matured in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. It offers a nose of ginger, raisins, old leather, smoky orange, blackcurrants, and walnuts. The palate is voluptuous, with full sherry notes, figs, dates, cinnamon, and cloves.

93,Big Peat 25 year old,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,236,"Peat has grown up to become the best version of himself that he can be. The mellow, sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. It’s like walking on an Islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. Lemon lozenges, Sweethearts, flashes of citrus, stewed apple, and growing smoke. The gentle, glossy, mouth-coating finish generates an urge to expertly puff smoke rings out through pursed lips. (300 bottles) £175",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018

The mouthfeel is flowing and silken, radiating flavors of golden syrup, tangerine, peppercorn, vanilla, light oak, and nougat. As the flavor crests, the sweetness is evocative of Château D’Yquem.

93,Midleton Very Rare 2017,40.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,214,"This year’s edition contains some of the oldest whiskey they’ve ever put into Very Rare. A pronounced spicy nose, with sweet barley, dried apple, crisp grains, sweet baklava, and squishy cubes of rose-scented Turkish delight. In the mouth, it’s incredibly smooth and glossy; quite honeyed, subtle soft fruits, raspberry, apple, mixed peel, butterscotch, baked orange, and a hearty spice core. A creamy finish, where the spices outlast the fruit.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
93,Dewar’s 25 year old,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,225,"Aged for a quarter century and finished in Royal Brackla casks? Count me in. The nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak, flapjacks, whole almonds, and gentle background spices.

The mouth-coating finish has plain chocolate, dry oak, and coffee. Brilliant liquid: smoothness personified.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
93,Michter’s 25 year old Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,800,"It packs a beautiful nose, with arcs of chocolate, vanilla wafer, cherry, caramelized brown sugar, baked pears, crème brûlée being torched, and coconut.

93,The Balvenie 1961 55 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Aged in a European oak oloroso sherry hogshead. Orange marmalade and lanolin on the nose, with caramel and candle wax dripped onto old leather. Full-bodied, with slightly bitter orange notes, plus nutmeg and aniseed on the palate. The orange theme persists into the finish as dried-out Jaffa segments, plus edgy oak tannins. A highly individualistic Balvenie.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
93,Bruichladdich 1984,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This 32 year old bottling was aged in twelve bourbon barrels and re-casked into fresh bourbon wood in 2009. It offers a nose of canned peaches, dates, marzipan, and a hint of milky coffee. Rich fruit flavors lead on the palate: peach, pineapple, and mango, with vanilla and nutty oak.

93,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch C917),,Bourbon/Tennessee,65,"When complex spice meets complex caramel, it makes for a wonderful American whiskey experience.

93,Yamazaki 12 year old,43.0,Japanese,85,"The first thing you notice is the elegant fragrance of lychee, spring blossoms, lily, rosewater, and raspberry meringue. Deeper in, grassy notes with star fruit, kumquat, and kaffir lime leaves. The flavors offer perfection in their simplicity: silky honey, soft spices, crystalized pineapple, barley sugar, lemon, and orange.

93,Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,140,"Following the Spice Tree recipe of 60% Clynelish, 20% Dailuaine, and 20% Teaninich, Extravaganza’s core was matured for more than four additional years in light/medium toast, refill, and heavy toast hybrid casks of American and French oak. Finally, sherry-matured Glen Ord, Benrinnes, and Allt-a-Bhainne were added to the mix. The elaborate process is typical of maverick blender John Glaser, but it’s his results that count. Flavors of peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry translate into a delicious honeyed palate of caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit. Ginger and clove provide further rigor before a finish of incendiary spices. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/7-compass-box-spice-tree-extravaganza/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 7 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>

93,Ardbeg An Oa,,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Ardbeg doles out occasional limited releases for their avid fans, but for nearly a decade the core range consisted of just three whiskies: 10 year old, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan. The addition of An Oa, matured in a combination of virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and bourbon barrels, and married in a French oak ‘gathering vat’ prior to bottling, marks a reason to celebrate. An Oa is a more approachable Ardbeg. It lacks some of the typical oiliness, but flavor and complexity abound with hot peat, black tea, and peppery cloves. Die-hard Ardbeg fans should have no complaints, and new converts have a real treat in store. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/6-ardbeg-an-oa/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 6 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>

But this underappreciated Speyside whisky compares well with more famous sherry bombs by offering a sweet, savory, slightly funky depth. At first sniff, Tamdhu seems like it might knock you out with one blow—but this gentle giant is a lover, not a fighter. Viscous and meaty, this cask-strength stunner reveals dried fruit, dark chocolate ganache, ginger spice, and saline minerality, thundering softly into a long finish.

Silky taste of butterscotch; it becomes more honeyed, with creamy vanilla, dried banana, malt, and a pinch of cinnamon, pepper, herbs, clove, and eucalyptus.

93,The Scotch Malt Whisky Society Pigs in Plaster 14 year old (#4.1980),,Single Malt Scotch,140,"This single cask, distilled at Highland Park, is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it’s Highland Park&#039;s signature sherry and peat, but on the palate it&#039;s a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke, salt, and oak spice, bolstered by the high proof. A smoky, dry finish rounds off a monster whisky, different from Highland Park&#039;s style, but very interesting. (<em>Julio’s Liquors only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
93,Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve (Lot 1867D),40.0,Canadian,50,"If you worried what would happen when Forty Creek ran out of Canadian oak barrels, you will be pleased to know John Hall found more local oak trees and had new barrels made; this time in Canada. This tightly integrated dram is rich in woody maple syrup, with raisins, almonds, and vanilla ice cream that softens a peppery glow. Silkier than the original, slightly restrained, and ever so quaffable. A longish, pithy finish begs another sip. Still a classic. Editor&#039;s Choice.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2015
93,Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Mortlach) 1991,,Single Malt Scotch,290,"Full gold. Weighty, but not oppressed by wood. Full, rich <em>rancio</em> aroma, which brings to mind an ancient cognac. It is rich and powerful, but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit, some spice, a lot of waxiness, licorice…and then the distillery’s signature meatiness. The palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits, and soft tannins. This has everything you want from a mature whisky, and from Mortlach, with added elegance. Highly recommended. £198",Dave Broom,Summer 2015
93,Wiser’s Red Letter 2014 Release Virgin Oak Finish,45.0,Canadian,79,"Pencil shavings, then vanilla, caramel, barley sugar, and bitter candied orange peel. Mild white pepper persists in a spicy fusion, from which a subtle but energizing pithiness teases out delicate smatterings of cloves, ginger, and allspice. The fruitiness of canned peaches, apricots, and sour green apples adds dimension and balance. Complex and so tightly integrated that rich as it is, individual flavors are little more than nuances. Finish is long and gingery with refreshing citrus pith. <em>(Canada only)</em> C$100",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2015
93,Redemption Barrel Proof Rye (Batch 1),61.0,Rye Whiskey,80,"Redemption repeats their barrel-proof MGP-sourced 95% rye, now at 7 years old. Has a year significantly changed last year&#039;s 90-point outing? Oak is more subdued and the pepper floats on sweet, light caramel. It is still quite nice at full-bore, no water needed. Sweet vanilla and bitter rye oil blend surprisingly well; this is hitting the bells, and it&#039;s better integrated. Big, swaggering, and sporting big-barrel maturity. Can go toe-to-toe with almost any rye out there.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
93,Redemption Barrel Proof Rye 10 year old,,Rye Whiskey,180,"Redemption delivers a 10 year old, barrel proof rye (sourced from MGP); the bottled whiskey is mingled from only six barrels. Nose of hot, bitter rye spice and caramel with oak. Great wham<em>bam!</em> feel of sweet whiskey followed immediately by oily, spicy rye, which then controls the flavor and finish without dominating. Not over-oaked, and these older MGP barrels are finally showing what 95% rye can do. At 6 years, it could be a high-rye bourbon; this simply shouts rye. Fascination.",Lew Bryson,Spring 2015
93,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2014 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Crisp clove, cool mint, cinnamon, and cocoa mingle with glazed orange, honeyed vanilla, caramel, and maple syrup. Polished oak and leather on the finish balance the sweet, fruity notes. More oak and dried spice when compared to the 2013 release (our American Whiskey of the Year) and, while not quite reaching that caliber (it’s not quite as seamless, drinkable, or complex), it gets close. Very impressive.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
93,Port Ellen 1978 35 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014),,Single Malt Scotch,3300,"Scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up, so either buddy-up to a rich guy, or club together to try this. Greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. The smoke’s in the background, as salted cashew, peppermint, tansy, furniture polish, and smoked meats take center stage. The palate is slowly expanding and smoked, with some chocolate and wax. Finally, a Port Ellen that is truly, classically mature. A killer. (2,964 bottles)",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
93,Ichiro’s Malt The Joker (distilled at Hanyu),,Japanese,273,"The final deal of Ichiro Akuto’s Card Series, a vatting of Hanyu from 1985 to 2000. Highly complex, rich, and distinctly resinous. Typical Hanyu boldness, but with balance struck between weightiness, finesse, and intensity. There’s old cobbler’s shop, tack room, light smoke, incense, ink, autumn leaves, and sumac. The palate is sweet to start, then builds in power. Leathery, then praline, damson jam, and fine tannins. Water loosens the tension, allowing yuzu to show. What a way to go out. £220",Dave Broom,Winter 2014
93,Maker’s Mark Cask Strength,,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"This is what I wish the standard Maker’s Mark would be: more mature, spicier, more complex, and with a richer finish. Caramel kissed with honey provides a base for marzipan, cotton candy, cinnamon, clove, and a balancing leather dryness on the finish.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
93,"Exclusive Malts Speyside 25 year old 1989 Cask #3,942",,Single Malt Scotch,200,"Exclusive Malts doesn&#039;t disclose the source distillery, which doesn&#039;t matter when you’ve got a whisky that’s a gem. Apple cider defines the nose and is complemented by ginger and iris. On the palate this whisky is lush but well balanced, with honeyed apple cider, gingerbread cookie, and baked apple. In the center of all this is <em>rancio</em>. Ginger spice and baked apple define the finish, which is long and flavorful. Great balance, integration, and flavor. What more can you ask for? <em>(</em><em>U.S. only)</em>",Geoffrey Kleinman,Winter 2014
93,Lagavulin 1995 Feis Ile 2014 bottling,,Single Malt Scotch,167,"A sherry-cask Lagavulin, this immediately shows a rich, mellow power with a touch of potter’s wheel, but it needs water to bring out sandalwood, beach bonfire, kombu, Lapsang Souchong, and bog myrtle. The palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick, unctuous even, with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham, membrillo, currants, blackberry. I’ve a feeling that this period will be seen as Lagavulin’s golden age. £99",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
93,Johnnie Walker Odyssey,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,1100,"Jim Beveridge delivered these aromas of toffee apple, peach, and rich berry fruits by working with European oak casks. The smoke is timid, with hints of background salinity. The finely structured mouthfeel is where this triple malt whisky truly shines: the polished smoothness is exceptional. The flavor journey begins with honey, citrus, and swirling melted chocolate, building to a fire of squeezed orange oils, dry fruits, and pecan nuttiness before concluding with rich espresso, dark caramels, and plain chocolate. Immaculate.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
93,Evan Williams Single Barrel (Barrel No. 1) 2004,,Bourbon/Tennessee,27,"Polished and nicely balanced, with caramel as the main note, followed by candied fruit, soft vanilla, sweet corn, and nougat. Subtle spice (ginger, cinnamon) and gentle oak on the finish round out the sweet notes. Easygoing demeanor and very drinkable. Great value too! A very pleasing, versatile bourbon. Value Pick.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
93,Cragganmore Triple Matured Edition,48.0,Single Malt Scotch,135,"Bottled for Friends of the Classic Malts (which means most of you), this is Cragganmore in early autumnal guise. Dry leaves underfoot, ripe black fruits on the bushes, waxed jacket, chestnut, and a whiff of cedary smoke, opening into dried peach. The palate is thickly textured, with those fruits, dark chocolate, and pomegranate molasses. The immensely long finish gives you light pepper, smoke, and blackberry jam. Cragganmore at its very best, and at a great price. £80",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
93,Mortlach 18 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,304,"Deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry, this has bosky notes and meat—mutton and venison—plus graphite, bitter chocolate, and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. This is the most savory and Bovril-like of the new range. The palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie, and rowan berries. Deep, but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which, in comparison, seems like a blunt instrument. £180/500 ml",Dave Broom,Summer 2014
93,Forty Creek Heart of Gold,43.0,Canadian,70,"Each fall, whisky lovers in Canada and Texas anticipate John Hall’s new limited edition whisky. This year’s sits squarely in the golden heart of classic Canadian rye. Tingling gingery pepper is bathed in ultra-creamy butterscotch, woody maple syrup, black tea, and barley sugar. Prune juice and ripe dark fruits dissolve into dried apricots and zesty hints of citrus. Then floral rye notes turn dusty, with gentle wisps of willow smoke. Complex, full-bodied, and slowly evolving, so let it breathe. C$70",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
93,Thomas H. Handy Sazerac,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The youthful, testosterone-laden member of the Antique Collection family. Bold and spicy with cinnamon and clove, but softened and balanced by thick toffee, vanilla, and honeyed orchard fruit. Lush and mouth-coating. An exercise in extremes: bold, muscular spice, along with soothing sweeter notes. While its older sibling, Sazerac 18 year old, expresses a classic “older rye” low-risk profile, Handy pushes the envelope in many directions. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
93,Douglas Laing Big Peat Christmas 2013,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,76,"Launched a few years ago with a Dr. Haddock-like cartoon figure on the label, Big Peat does just what it suggests it does…and then some. It's a mix of Islay peated malts and includes some Port Ellen, but don't get distracted by that. Instead, indulge yourself in the biggest, peatiest, oiliest, earthiest, grungiest, gunkiest slab of industrial malt this side of a leaky steam engine. This whisky just gets better and better.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
93,Wiser’s Red Letter 2013 Release,45.0,Canadian,99,"Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, candy sweetness, and strong bitter grapefruit pith overtake an initial dry dusty rye. After years in an assortment of bourbon barrels, new wood is used to tame the rugged rye notes while adding complexity and breadth. The oak has left obvious traces behind, with barrel notes and hints of fresh-cut firewood. Candied, in the vein of Wiser’s Legacy, but sharper, harder, and much crisper. Canada’s non-chill filtered reward for being Wiser’s biggest fan. (<i>Canada only.) </i>C$99",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2013
93,Millstone Rye 100,50.0,Dutch,,"From the distillery that received last year’s World Whisky award comes another contender for the title in 2013. This is called 100 because it’s 100 percent rye distilled in pot stills, 100 proof, and 100 months old (a bit over eight years). It’s big, and perfectly balanced between honey and fruit, sparkling distinctive raunchy spice, and a dash of ginger biscuits. This is rye to die for. Superb. €53",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
93,Kavalan Bourbon Oak,46.0,Taiwanese Whisky,,"Surprise, surprise. This is like the school's best pitcher, who then steps onto the football team and throws for a game-winning touchdown. This is a whole new side to Kavalan. Remember Faith No More doing “Easy”? Having out-sherried and out-bourboned us with kickass rock-n-roll whisky, Kavalan goes for gentle and croony, with vanilla and honey. The coup de grace? Apple pie and cream morph into licorice and menthol. Exquisite. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
93,Evan Williams Single Barrel 2003 Vintage (Barrel No. 1),,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"Silky smooth. Lush honey notes married with bright orchard fruit and candied tropical fruit. Soft vanilla, mint, and cinnamon round out the palate. Seamless and perilously drinkable. Proof that a bourbon doesn’t have to be old, high in alcohol, or expensive to be good. <em>Editor&#039;s Choice &amp; Value Pick</em>",John Hansell,Spring 2013
93,Michter’s 20 year old Bourbon (Barrel #1646),,Bourbon/Tennessee,450,"A soothing bourbon, with maple syrup, blackberry preserve, polished leather, roasted nuts, marzipan, vanilla toffee, dusty dates, subtle tobacco, and a hint of pedro ximinez sherry. Soft, flavorful finish. The oak is kept in check, with layered sugars and fruit for balance. The price of admission is steep, but this whiskey is very satisfying.",John Hansell,Spring 2013
93,Millstone Sherry Cask 12 year old,46.0,Dutch,,"Millstone is made by Zuidam, a Dutch spirits and liquor company that prides itself on never cutting corners and in using the very finest ingredients. There are hundreds of European distilleries making spirit, but few this good. Its malt and rye whiskies have always been special, but this is Premier League, a world class sherried 12 year old that matches many sherried Scotch whiskies flavor to flavor. That&#039;s a first for Europe. €60",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2013
93,Gibson’s Finest Rare 18 year old,40.0,Canadian,,"A quintessential Canadian whisky that holds fresh-cut lumber, hot white pepper, and creamy oak caramels in delicate balance. Long years in oak have delivered a range of complex flavors that evolve slowly in the glass and on the tongue. Sweet vanilla contrasts with dusty rye, while a drop of pickle juice slowly matures into poached pears with cloves. Dry grain ripens into fresh-baked biscuits before it all fades away in clean oak and citrus pith. C$75",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
93,Compass Box Oak Cross,46.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"This has long been a core whisky for Compass Box, but the latest version of it is spicier and fresher than I recall, and without doubt, it's my new best friend. Virgin French oak heads help to contribute oriental and aromatic spices on the nose, with hints of melon and pineapple candy sweets. The taste is a delight, with spearmint, soft toffee, sweet citrus fruit, lemonade mixed with beer, and strawberry wafers. An array of spices from cinnamon to chili to ginger dominate the finish.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
93,Elijah Craig Single Barrel (Barrel No. 13) 20 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"All the current Elijah Craig 20 year old releases in distribution are single barrel offerings. I’ve tasted a few, and they vary to a degree. This is my favorite so far. Yes, there’s a lot of oak here (resinous, spicy, leathery, tobacco-tinged), but it’s on a bed of layered sweetness (nutty toffee, caramel fudge, maple syrup) that supports and marries with the oak. An ideal postprandial bourbon.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
93,Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2012 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,95,"Elegant, clean, and peppered with dried spice notes throughout (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice). Additional notes of barrel char, vanilla wafer, summer fruits, caramel corn, maple syrup, and candied almond add complexity. Begins sweet, but dries out nicely on the finish, inviting another sip. Very nice! ",John Hansell,Fall 2012
93,Glenfarclas 1953,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The hits just keep on coming for Glenfarclas. Here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. You can tell it’s old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it’s Glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness, but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen’s barbershop, rowan berry, and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house. Mysterious, subtle, and highly complex. £5,995",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
93,Diamond Jubilee by John Walker & Sons,,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"Bright gold. Amazingly fresh fruits and quince, slowly evolving into mango, blueberry, and a jammy tayberry note. At the same time, exotic spices like cardamom begin to build, particularly when the surface is broken with a drop of water, while vanilla pod notes develop. In the mouth, the grain smooths all the elements, giving an unctuous feel. There’s just sufficient oakiness to give structure and any smoke is far in the distance.  A triumph of the blender’s art. £100,000",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
93,Glenfarclas Family Cask 1972 (Cask #3551),,Single Malt Scotch,599,"Dark amber in hue, this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There’s dried peach and fruit leather, toffee, and, with water, biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (U.S. exclusive).",Dave Broom,Summer 2012
93,Kavalan Solist Vinho Barrique,60.0,Taiwanese Whisky,,"The Kavalan flag is unfurling fast. The whiskies are making it Stateside, and they're improving from a very high base. A couple of degrees stronger than previously, this is far richer than any wine cask-matured whisky has a right to be. This is huge, with a tropical nose of mango, melon, and papaya, and a hint of dustiness. The palate is astounding. Rich, sweet, and rounded, it coats the mouth with an intense mixture tempered by burnt toffee and cocoa. Stunning.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
93,The Whisky Exchange Masterpieces Range 18 year old 1990 vintage (distilled at Bowmore),,Single Malt Scotch,,"Bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. Rather, they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. Here is one such example. Initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil, but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. The smoke hits first on the tongue, backed up with mango and violet, then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish.",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
93,Lagavulin 1993 Islay Jazz Festival bottling (bottled 2011),,Single Malt Scotch,127,"An extremely limited edition issued at last year’s Islay Jazz Fest, this was chosen by warehouseman Iain McArthur as a prime example of a ‘bodega’ sherry butt (see page XX for more on the ‘bodega’ process). It is, simply, massive, with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers, burning rosemary, fig, coffee, and candied peels. The smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot, earth, and a rolling wave of deep, pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. Magnificent. (<em>Distillery only</em>) £80",Dave Broom,Spring 2012
93,Eagle Rare 17 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The most underrated of the five in the 2011 collection, but this year’s release (like last year’s) is very lovely bourbon. Perhaps just a bit softer than last year, but with a similar profile: very even keeled and nicely balanced, with sweet notes (vanilla, toffee, añejo rum) peppered with soft orchard fruit and spice (cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, hint of mint), polished oak, and subtle tobacco. ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
93,The Dalmore 1978,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,750,"This 1978 vintage release from The Dalmore has been ‘finished’ for two years in Matusalem sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass, following 29 years in American white oak. Just 477 bottles are available. Freshly-ground coffee, marzipan, dark berries, and rich sherry on the smooth nose, with milk chocolate and Jaffa oranges. Smokier with water. Citrus fruits and more milk chocolate on the rich, full palate, plus roasted almonds. Long and juicy in the finish, with aniseed and fruit pastilles.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
93,Thomas H. Handy Sazerac,,Rye Whiskey,,"The youngster in the 2011 Antique Collection. One taste and its relative youth is confirmed. (But no worries; it’s mature enough to enjoy neat or with some water (and would be a killer in cocktails). This is rye whiskey in its most vibrant, masculine, and purest form. Bold spice (fresh evergreen, warming cinnamon), honey-coated orchard fruit, golden raisin, caramel, and brandy with a crisp, clean finish. The American equivalent to a young, cask-strength, smoky Islay whisky. ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
93,Convalmore 1977 28 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"OK, confession time. This remains one of my favorite whiskies ever, a classic example of what long, slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky — increase its unctuous nature, bring out butterscotch, ginseng, honey, deepen the orchard fruits, and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. It has balance, it has finesse, and there’s not much left. £155(Not available in the U.S.)",Dave Broom,Fall 2011
93,Glenmorangie Pride 1981,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a whisky with an intense, pungent, earthy nose; very complex, with polished old furniture notes, spices, oak tannins, and licorice. The palate is ‘full on’ for a Glenmorangie; waxy, with sherbet, honey, and baked apple, then orange marmalade, sultana, and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1, 2011. Price is approximate.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2011
93,Eagle Rare 17 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The only setback from last year’s Antique Collection release, when I rated it an 84 because it was showing too much wood (especially compared to the 2007-2008 releases). The 2010 release is back on track, with great balance, and showing very traditional notes of vanilla toffee, rummy molasses, dusty corn, soft summer fruit, and a sprinkling of spice (cinnamon, mint, cocoa), with oak resin to balance out the sweet notes. (<em>Editor&#039;s Choice</em>)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
93,Jefferson’s Presidential Select,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"I’ve tasted several batches of this whiskey (made at the old Stitzel-Weller distillery), from the inaugural Batch #1 when it was a 17 year old, to this new release. It’s not surprising that they taste progressively older. My favorite is still the first batch, but this whiskey holds up nicely and shows a similar flavor profile with a bit more wood influence: blackberry jam, nutty toffee, nougat, creamy vanilla, cinnamon, and a touch of polished oak on the finish. Nice texture, too, with good viscosity and grip on the finish.",John Hansell,Spring 2011
93,"The Glenrothes “John Ramsay,” 46.7%",,Single Malt Scotch,,"Made from whisky aged in second fill American oak sherry casks, distilled between 1973 to 1987. Richly malty, with honeyed citrus, juicy oak, chocolate fudge, and nougat. More subtle floral notes, licorice (red and black), ginger, and chamomile tea. Polished oak on the finish balances the sweetness. A great whisky to honor a great whisky maker! (Only 200 bottles for the U.S.)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
93,Port Ellen 31 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year, which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. For me, this is up there with last year’s bottling, which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.

This is different, however. Yes, the color is as pale as ever — has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? — and yes, the nose initially shows all of the distillery’s austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt ‘fishiness,’ while there’s also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness, which is more to the fore, and also, it would seem, a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole.

The palate has a numb spot right on the front, then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar, draped in wet seaweed, encrusted with barnacles and clams — and clutching a kipper. But don’t forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complex…and there’s a scant 3,000 bottled for the globe. [not available in the U.S.] £280",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
93,Thomas H. Handy Rye,,Rye Whiskey,,"One of the best Handy offerings yet. Very vibrant with dynamic spice (firm mint, warming cinnamon, allspice, hint of clove) and lush fruit (citrus, orchard fruit, golden raisin, brandy, and teasing coconut), all tamed by a bed of soothing caramel and honey. It’s not easy for a whiskey to come across as excitingly youthful, yet nicely matured. It’s a difficult balance to achieve, but this whiskey pulls it off. (Editor's Choice)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
93,Angel’s Envy,,Bourbon/Tennessee,46,"Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey finished in a port pipe. This is veteran master distiller Lincoln Henderson’s newest creation, and it’s a beauty. Richly textured, silky, and well-rounded, with ripe berried fruits, candied tangerine, light toffee, maple syrup, and creamy vanilla, sprinkled with spice (cinnamon, hint of mint). Smooth, silky finish, and dangerously drinkable! The port pipe notes dovetail perfectly. Lovely just the way it is, but it’s begging for a cigar. My only gripe: why not 45 or 50&#37; ABV? But I’m splitting hairs. I really enjoy this stuff!",John Hansell,Spring 2011
94,Loch Lomond 2002 Kerr Cellars Red Wine Cask-Finished,,Single Malt Scotch,200,"Delicately aromatic and tropical on the nose, with piña colada, pistachio pudding, almond halva, coconut, and apple blossom. The palate is elegant and pretty, nuanced with pistachio, almond, vanilla malted milkshake, coconut, and pineapple, before sweeping oak and tobacco roll into a gorgeous tropical fruit and toasted coconut finish. A masterwork in balancing spirit character with finishing cask.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
94,Amrut Norfolk Wine & Spirits Single Cask Single Malt (Cask #662),60.0,Indian Whisky,230,"Expressive and aromatic on the nose, with mingling aromas of spiced smoke—like burning

sage—dried herbs, sandalwood, rose petal, and citrus oil. Its high proof equals big flavor on the

palate: a rush of guava, pineapple, and kiwi dusted with cinnamon, then almond, pipe tobacco,

and mocha. Adding water brings out more savory notes that meld seamlessly with the spice, nuts,

and rich dark chocolate. The lush finish swirls with chocolate, raisins, bitter almonds, and

tropical fruit. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was sherry cask-finished, but it’s actually from

a single bourbon barrel. (120 bottles; Norfolk Wine &amp; Spirits exclusive)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
94,Kavalan 10th Anniversary Bordeaux Margaux Wine Cask-Matured Single Malt,,Taiwanese Whisky,283,"Beautiful dark amber in color, this has a fabulous nose of lush red-berry fruits, blueberry, red apple, blackcurrant, Fabbri strawberries, peppercorn, wet slate, dry oak, wood spices, and smoked meats. The power of the muscular whisky matches the majesty of the wine cask: berry fruit flavors seep from the thick caramel mouthfeel amid an explosion of pepper at high strength, but with water added this still has incredible range. NT$8,800",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
94,Writers’ Tears Double Oak,46.0,Blended Irish Whiskey,65,"This blend of single malt and pot still whiskeys exhibits the incredible synergy between chocolate, cinnamon, and pot still spices. Vinous at times from partial cognac-cask maturation, this has aromas of dark berry fruit, cinnamon, fudge, milk chocolate, malt biscuits, jellied fruit, and a smudge of dry spices. Compelling, well-structured whiskey, with cinnamon, chocolate, dark toffee, pepper, and ginger. It’s never cloying, nor overly sweet, just a richly rewarding glass.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
94,Bardstown Bourbon Company Discovery Series #1 Kentucky Straight Bourbon,,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"Candy corn, butter, warm frosted buns, strawberry tart, and powdered sugar on the nose. The palate is spiced with cinnamon, clove, and roasted walnuts, as well as chocolate-covered cherries, raspberry cobbler, and a hint of coconut shavings. Length, depth, and heat on a finish of chocolate, caramel, and bursts of sweet baking spice. Deep and complex, balancing dark fruits, chocolate, spice, and tobacco. Powerful and subtle all at once.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
94,Dewar’s 32 year old Double Double,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"If a Scotch whisky could smell plush and velvety, this Pedro Ximénez-finished blend would be it. Chocolate-covered raisins, peat smoke, cigar lounge, licorice, chamois leather, and charred oak staves. The palate is smooth, delicate, and finely tuned with syrupy prune, raisins, plum, raspberry, strawberry, 70% dark chocolate, peppercorn, ginger, clove, and a hint of smoke. This showcases lip-smacking, intricate blending on the oldest Dewar’s available. <em>Editors&#039; Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
94,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch A119),,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"This year’s first of three annual releases has a higher ABV than Whisky Advocate’s 2017 Whisky of the Year, which was 62.1%. The nose offers caramel, vanilla cream pie, cocoa powder, baking spice, baked apple, orange, marzipan, leather, and oak. Very well-integrated on the palate, but the high ABV cries out for water, which brings chocolate, butterscotch, bitter orange, coconut, almond, and creamed corn. The finish is a long, delightful reprise of it all. <em>Editors&#039; Choice</em>",David Fleming,Summer 2019
94,Midleton Very Rare 2018,40.0,Irish Blended Whiskey,200,"Each MVR vintage has its own character, and the latest version has a sweet motif coddled in a soft, fruity bounty. Orange tartlets, white pepper, cantaloupe, nectarine, pear, malt, and rounded oak greet the nose. Honey and caramel with citrus, pulped fruit, and spice, before a sweeter phase of tablet, toffee, and vanilla flavors on the palate. Spices only nibble at the sweet and comforting finish. <em>Collectible</em>",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
94,Michter’s 20 year old Straight Bourbon 2018 (Batch 18I1371),,Bourbon/Tennessee,700,"Age is readily apparent, not as weariness, but sheer intensity—like a Vise-Grip handshake from an old man. The flavors come in rapid waves, first on the nose with pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, sassafras, cassis, licorice, orange peel, and menthol-like hints of solvent. Then chewy fruit and drying oak harmonize on the palate, the dark berry fruits playing off the refined oak with its cedary spice. The drying finish echoes of rustling autumn leaves and plum skins. Exquisitely balanced and muscular.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
94,Balvenie 1971 vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This veteran was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. The nose is fragrant, with malt, raisins, and tangy orange in time, settling to stewed fruits; a pleasing harmony of aromas. The palate is chewy and spicy, with a lovely bitter-sweet interplay between orchard fruits and dark oak, sprinkled with icing sugar. Licorice, tannic oak, and bitter chocolate in the very long finish. A classic survivor. £21,000",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
94,Glenmorangie Signet,46.0,Single Malt Scotch,220,"An innovative offering made with a proportion of chocolate malt and matured in virgin American oak. Some of the component whiskies are between 35 and 40 years old. Milk chocolate, honey, orange marmalade, sultanas, and spice on the inviting nose. The palate is rich and full, with malt, dates, Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, and coffee beans. Long and spicy in the drying finish. Glenmorangie at its very best.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
94,Knappogue Castle 21 year old,46.0,Irish Single Malt,200,"A limited-release vatting of triple distilled, bourbon cask-matured spirit distilled in 1994 and 1996. This immersive and intense whiskey has waves of honey and fruit sweetness, floral and herbal notes, melting butter on fruit scones, macaroon bar, vanilla pod, candied grapefruit peel, and faint wood spices. Sharp orange, kumquat, and lime flavors mingle with honey, vanilla fudge, and barley sugar. Spices peak and retreat ahead of a sweet finish.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
94,Compass Box Flaming Heart 2018 Edition,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"Refined elegant smoke, quayside ropes, liniment oil, waxed lemon, cake mix, ripe peach, and a buoyant maltiness, as Flaming Heart roars back with a vengeance. After the controversy surrounding the 15th Anniversary edition, this time it’s all about the whisky. Sweet tangy orange, bitter peel oils, dark chocolate, clove, peppercorn, and nutmeg glide into menthol, spice, beeswax, and espresso on the finish. Solid gold: this is what they do best. (15,050 bottles and 800 magnums at $330) <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
94,John Walker & Sons King George V,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,600,"Highland toffee, dried banana, salted caramel, seashells flipped from rock pools, and crispy-skinned oily fish barbecuing over a fire. Sweet toffee meets cinnamon, pepper, and clove, as an express train of smoke clatters through, leaving intense citrus peel oils and green fruits in the backwash. A spasm of spice marks the finish: arid, amid baked fruits and toffee. Leave me now, I have everything I need.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
94,Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ghost and Rare Port Ellen Edition,,Blended Scotch Whisky,350,"This uninhibited, tempestuous expression of Blue Label highlights the artistry of the blender through the judicious use of closed distillery malts and grains. Coastal notes of sea spray, lemon, dirty peat smoke, cookies and cream, After Eight mints, caramel, and dry-roasted spice aromas. Combining lemon bonbon, waxy orange, cookie dough, fondant icing, and chocolate, with tobacco smoke, hints of peppermint, and grapefruit notes, this flagrantly outclasses the Brora variant.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
94,Powers John’s Lane 12 year old,46.0,Irish Single Pot Still,70,"Brooding, primal, and robust thanks to its fat, rolling, oily notes, slightly fermenting Bramley apples, oolong tea, green banana, hint of sherry, and purposeful delivery of allspice, peppercorns, and star anise. The fruit and chocolate stay one step ahead of the spices; orange, chocolate, coffee, apricot, boiled candy, marmalade on buttered toast, and barley sugar meet a finish of heavier spices, bitter chocolate, and dusty cocoa. Unmistakable, epic whiskey.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
94,Nikka From the Barrel,,Japanese,65,"Notably balanced and elegant, the colorful palette of whiskies combines for tremendous depth of flavor. Soft, sweet butterscotch and orange peel meet poached pears and stone fruits. Earthiness appears as dried autumn leaves, coffee, old oak, and tobacco. Among the tangle of spices, tasters identified chili pepper, allspice, cloves, and universally adored its ginger note. Finally, wisps of smoke and sea salt. Overall, it feels generously malty, with the grain whisky lending broad sweetness and supple mouthfeel across the long finish.



Beyond its delightful flavors, Nikka From the Barrel presents some paradoxes worthy of contemplation over a glass. It is a classic, yet new to the U.S. It is typically Japanese, yet singularly magnificent. It is delightful sipped neat and also blossoms with water. Even the simple, squat bottle is in contrast to the profound complexity within. (Fortunately, the 500 ml bottle offered in other markets received a supersizing for U.S. drinkers.)



The great majority of new Japanese whiskies now arriving to our shores are so rare and so expensive that they seem intended only for elite whisky lovers. Nikka From the Barrel is a consummate Japanese blend for anyone to enjoy. <em><a href=""/top20/2018/1-nikka-from-the-barrel/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 1 in the 2018 Top 20</a></em>

94,Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye,,Rye Whiskey,70,"This limited-edition rye from Knob Creek beat the odds to rise to number two by flexing its muscle to impress tasters from both the U.S. and the UK. Superlatives were in good supply: intense, massively chewy, huge, very bold, aggressive. This 9 year old, unfiltered, cask-strength bottling simply presents heaps of flavor for a fair price. Caramel-drizzled flan, charred marshmallow, and honey-roasted peanut aromas lead to mouth-filling flavors of tropical fruits, citrus oil, and peach nectar. Lemony bright with cinnamon and peppery spice galore, it’s surprisingly drinkable at proof, but water really unpacks the flavors. <em><a href=""/top20/2018/2-knob-creek-cask-strength-rye/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 2 in the 2018 Top 20</a></em>

94,Russell’s Reserve 2002,,Bourbon/Tennessee,250,"Lovely aromas of warm banana bread with toasted nuts are met with oak and underlying savory notes of garden soil, mushroom, barnyard, and menthol that build layers of complexity. The flavor similarly melds sweet and earthy notes, as Bit-O-Honey and grape candy yield to zesty lemon, drying tobacco leaf, and polished oak tannins. The sweetness, perfectly permeated with earthy complexity, is totally captivating, made complete by a long and satisfying finish laced with spices.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
94,J.P. Wiser’s 35 year old (2018 batch),50.0,Canadian,165,"Teasing out the threads of this perfectly woven fabric takes time. And what an enjoyable time it is! Big whisky with no dominant notes, but enticing suggestions of pine pitch, butterscotch, barley sugars, freshwater plants, sandalwood, cream, brisk peppery spices, sweetish baking spices, clean wood with vague tannins, and gorgeous orange bitters late in the finish. Apricots, hard peaches, and echoes of raspberries throughout.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2018
94,Ardbeg Uigeadail,,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Launched in 2003, Uigeadail remains one of Ardbeg’s core offerings. Matured in a mix of sherry and bourbon barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peppery peat, warm tar, coffee grounds, machine oil, and black pepper on the nose. The palate is complex and rich, offering orange segments sprinkled with sea salt, dark chocolate, malt, and ever-present sweet peat. Nicely balanced. Lengthy in the finish, with smoky caramel.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
94,Gelston’s 25 year old,,Irish Single Malt,450,"Like a delicious bowl of breakfast cereal, this has pecan, cinnamon, and Quaker oats, all wonderfully balanced with oak, barley, vanilla, dry spices, and drizzled runny honey.

94,Bowmore 50 year old 1966 vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The third and most exclusive release in Bowmore’s Vault Legends Collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675. The nose is fragrant and musky, slightly oily, with orange peel, developing vanilla, and green citrus notes. Intense orange and peach on the palate, with black pepper, aniseed, and sweet oak. Very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. No negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
94,King of Kentucky 14 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"Simply beautiful. It’s so complex, with notes of molasses, apple butter, toffee, salt water taffy, hazelnut, burnt brown sugar, crème brûlée, caramel flan, butterscotch, crystallized ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, fenugreek, roasted almonds, and marshmallow. With a drop of water, another complex layer forms with cotton candy and burnt pie crust. In both cases, it finishes extremely long.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
94,Compass Box Phenomenology,46.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,180,"The nose has honey, caramelized apples, Pixy Stix, pears in cream, faint pepper, ground coriander, and salty driftwood. It’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness, the silky texture meting out pears, apples, sweet barley notes, and crunchy spices, before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper, licorice, and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7,908 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
94,Redemption 18 year old Straight Rye,,Rye Whiskey,400,"This sings a tune of balance, with caramel, coconut, chocolate, barrel char, and campfire smoke harmonizing at the opening. Next comes an amazingly complex series of herbal notes: dill, oregano, and thyme. That’s when cinnamon bread, coffee, and crème brûlée take over; each note super concentrated and rounded. The long finish presents a hint of cinnamon. This is a must-have sipper. (450 bottles)",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
94,Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades,52.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"Wild Turkey often exhibits a delightful earthiness, and when earth meets sweet in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades achieves a rich texture where deep-tilled soil, fresh-cut grass, and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate, followed by dill, oregano, and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. Master distiller Eddie Russell mingled barrels ranging from 10 to 20 years old in order to strike this balance and complexity. His method displays the potential of combining extremely old stocks into batches with younger barrels to build a great whiskey. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/3-wild-turkey-masters-keep-decades/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 3 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>

Under the beautiful spice come vanilla cake batter, almond butter, and salt water taffy that walk it to a finish that just doesn’t quit.

94,Glenmorangie Astar 2017,,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral, with rosehips, orange blossom, and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. Honey and citrus notes follow. Voluptuous on the palate; sweet, even sugary fresh fruit notes, plus vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves. Drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. Extremely accomplished.

Astar is matured in custom toasted casks made from slow-growing trees on north-facing slopes in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. The barrels harbor bourbon for four years before heading to Glenmorangie. That level of provenance doesn’t come cheap, which is why the original Astar was discontinued in 2012, just four years after its acclaimed appearance. The exquisite Glenmorangie aromas and flavors—floral, with rose hips and orange blossom—are dialed up to new levels of intensity, while the voluptuous and sweet palate exudes harmony and balance. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/2-glenmorangie-astar-2017-release/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 2 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>

However, this superlative 12 year old confirms why many consumers like their Lagavulin younger. This is Lagavulin at its very best: bold, yet complex and satisfying; full of character, with smoky, savory, maritime, sweet vanilla, and fruit notes all merging into a balanced and eminently drinkable whole. It takes a few drops of water well, releasing burnt grass aromas and more palate sweetness. The Diageo Special Releases are not known to be bargains, but this Lagavulin is sensibly priced, and the greatest all-around value from the 2017 lineup. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/4-lagavulin-12-year-old-diageo-special-releases-2017/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 4 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>

Woven around it, there’s crème caramel and heavier cinnamon flaring at the margins, softening with dilution, but remaining sweet. The first Midleton to carry master distiller Brian Nation’s name is purposeful and assured, lacking some of the sappiness of the 2013 release.

I’m smitten by the vanilla creaminess, burgeoning deep fruit layers, how it swells with a satisfying snuffbox smokiness. A beautifully styled blend delivering a captivating, sensuous experience. (330 bottles only)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
94,Brora 40 year old Single Cask 1972 Vintage,,Single Malt Scotch,11824,"Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Whiskies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose, with malt, dried fruit, and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash, licorice, honey, more pepper, and well-integrated oak. The finish is long, with peat smoke, plain chocolate, and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding. £7,000",Gavin Smith,Summer 2014
94,Eagle Rare 17 year old (bottled Spring 2013),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Often overlooked in this portfolio because it isn’t barrel proof. The last few years of this bourbon have been wonderful. This year is no exception, with a bit more spice. Notes of nutty toffee, caramel, creamy vanilla, and pot still rum, with interwoven hints of oak resin, dried spice, tobacco, and honeyed fruit. Hint of barrel char and anise for intrigue. Delicious! (And actually 19 years old, even though it bears the traditional 17 year age statement.) Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
94,Elijah Craig 21 year old Single Barrel (No. 42),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,140,"Surprisingly reserved on the oak spice; it tastes like a bourbon half its age. Soothing in nature, with layers of sweetness (honey, vanilla cream, caramel, nougat), lively complex fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe peach, honeydew melon), and gentle cinnamon. Soft, creamy finish. A whiskey that has aged very gracefully. Delicious! (This is a single barrel; every barrel is unique.)",John Hansell,Winter 2013
94,Amrut Greedy Angels,50.0,Indian Whisky,,"A whopping three-quarters of the spirit put in these casks was taken by greedy angels. It has a big waft of crystallized pineapple, tropical fruits, and spiky spice on the nose. On the palate, red licorice, syrupy jellied fruits, some mandarin, cherry lozenge, and tinned strawberries, and the same menthol rancio you’d kill for in a 30 year old scotch. This is Amrut's oldest-ever whisky; it's as rare as hen's teeth…and just 8 years old. Awesome. ",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2013
94,Lot No. 40 2012 Release,43.0,Canadian,,"Distilled from 90% rye grain and 10% rye malt, Lot No. 40 boldly mingles the galvanizing piquancy of distilled rye grain with the soaring floral fragrance of malted rye, and a fruitiness born of age. It begins with hard, dusty, earthy rye, and sour rye bread, followed by a trio of baking spices: cloves, nutmeg, and blistering ginger. A farm-tinged sourness fades into citrus fruit with velvet tannins. (Canada only)C$40",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2013
94,Masterson’s Straight Rye,45.0,Rye Whiskey,,"A seamless fusion of rain-moistened earth, gunnysacks, and searing white pepper underpins the delicately bitter grain-like notes of fresh-baked rye bread. Lilacs and violets speak of rye grain, as do delicate cloves and tingling ginger, while dark stewed fruits attest to age. A mingling of hand-selected barrels of 10 year old all rye whisky, Masterson’s is redolent of vintage car leather and kiln-dried burley tobacco, with touches of dry herbs and spearmint. Sweet vanilla envelops early butterscotch.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2013
94,Johnnie Walker The Casks Edition,,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"You don't mess with the Johnnie Walker brand name casually, so we expect greatness, and boy, do we get it here. This has a dusty, smoky nose with dried apricot and grape, and the whisky is gossamer-soft on the palate, with sweet pear and honey evolving on top of an oaky rich heart before a tidal wave of pepper and peat, and a delightful spice smoke and oak conclusion. Magnificent. ",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2012
94,Eagle Rare 17 year old (bottled Spring 2012),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Usually the least talked-about in the Antique Collection, but in my opinion certainly of the same caliber. This year’s release proves my point: nutty toffee and rummy molasses notes balanced nicely with dried fruit, cinnamon, polished oak, subtle leather, and tobacco. The oak is kept in check for such an age, and all the flavors work well together. Nicely done!",John Hansell,Winter 2012
94,Brora 35 year old Special Release 2012,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Previous Broras in the Diageo Special Release series have set the bar remarkably high, and this, the eleventh such bottling, does not disappoint. The component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. Musty malt and coal in the background. The citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy, peppery palate, while French mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1,566 bottles.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2012
94,The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #3),,Single Malt Scotch,250,"A combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. This is a complex, dynamic whisky, loaded with lush, layered ripe fruit (red berries, tropical fruit, honeyed apricot, raisin), toffee, oak resin, polished leather, and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, clove). Long, warming finish. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",John Hansell,Fall 2012
94,Blue Hanger 6th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,,"If you want proof that blended malts can be world class, you'll find it in any bottle of Blue Hanger. Lovingly created by Berry Bros. whisky maker Doug McIvor, every release has been exceptional. Even by the series’ own high standards, this sixth release surpasses itself. The nose is fresh, clean, and citrusy, with wafts of sherry. But there are smoky hints, too. And it's that peaty, earthy note on the palate that gives this release a new dimension, enriching the fruity Speyside sweetness at the whisky's core. The age and quality of the malt asserts itself throughout. This really is stunning stuff. £68",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2012
94,Kavalan Solist Ex-Bourbon Cask,,Taiwanese Whisky,,"This is the pick of the bunch, the whisky equivalent of Fountains of Wayne; an effervescent dessert whisky, which from the first aroma to the final finish is a consistent mix of vanilla, coconut, and overripe banana, sprinkled with icing sugar and cinnamon.",Dominic Roskrow,Summer 2012
94,Highland Park 18 Year Old,43.0,Single Malt Scotch,,"Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat, soft toffee, floral notes, and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose.  Superbly balanced on the velvety palate, with brittle toffee, stewed fruits, peat, honey, and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long, elegant finish. ",Gavin Smith,Spring 2012
94,Aberfeldy 14 year old Single Cask,,Single Malt Scotch,181,"Single cask Aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between, and this is a stunner! After hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. The nose offers sultanas, raisins, and hot chocolate. Developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. Finally, burnt sugar and caramel. Insinuating and syrupy on the palate, with apricots, dried fruits, honey, and sherry. Gently spicy and warming, with licorice in the notably long finish. £115",Gavin Smith,Winter 2011
94,Powers John’s Lane,46.0,Irish Single Pot Still,75,"Wow! Could this be the greatest comeback since Rocky climbed back in the ring and showed the young upstarts who was the boss? It’s taken Irish Distillers a long time to respond to the pounding it’s taken from Cooley but it’s back in the ring with two wonderful pot still whiskeys. This is the better of the two, a whopping oily, woody package of classic pot still Irishness. The green fruits tumble over tannin and spice like frisky puppies. €55 (Currently not available in the U.S.)Editor&#039;s Choice",Dominic Roskrow,Fall 2011
94,George T. Stagg,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Very close to last year’s release in personality, with great balance between the sweetness, spice, and fruit. Nicely structured, with clearly defined notes of toffee, molasses, cinnamon, vanilla bean, dried citrus, brittle mint, roasted nuts, tobacco, and polished leather on the finish. (Editor's Choice)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
94,GlenDronach Grandeur 31 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,700,"The new ultra-mature release, following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). It’s nice to see the higher ABV, given that the 33 year old was only 40%. Very soothing. Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate, with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing), dark raisin, black raspberry, orange marmalade, roasted nuts, and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon, ginger, and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it’s sherried, and the sherry is kept in balance. Those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it).",John Hansell,Spring 2011
94,Lagavulin 12 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,109,"There’s precious little reticence about this beast, which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere — then comes raffia, Lapsang Souchong tea, seashore, wet rocks, Elastoplast, talcum powder, bog myrtle (laurel), vetiver, and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. Huge and complex, in other words. The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away, now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water, and when it’s added, out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character — it’s not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin, but it’s here — which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. After this year’s sublime distillery-only bottling, it’s clear that Lagavulin is in a real purple patch. Superb.",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
95,Redbreast 20 year old Dream Cask Pedro Ximénez Edition,,Irish Single Pot Still,415,"Following one of 2018’s most collectible releases, this vatting of four mature pot still whiskeys finished in a PX butt is quite a departure for Redbreast. The nose has incredible depth, with dark, sticky, concentrated black cherry, candied peel, coriander leaf, vanilla, allspice, clove, and whole almond. This heavy, unctuous, mouth-coating whiskey resonates with rich fruits, clove, licorice, and juicy blackberry, ending with pot still spice and bitter notes. (924 bottles) €380",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
95,Uncle Nearest 1820 Single Barrel 11 year old Tennessee Whiskey (Barrel US-2),,Bourbon/Tennessee,119,"This is mature whiskey at its most refined: a balance of fruits, nuts, sweetness, and restrained oak. The nose has it all: salted, buttered pecans, rock candy, Dr. Pepper, blackberry jam, dried blueberries, caramel corn, tobacco barn, and old leather chair. It’s practically dessert-like in the mouth, with dark chocolate-covered caramel, candied pecans, Goo Goo Clusters, cherry cola, blackberry and blueberry jam, and a kiss of white pepper. The finish stays consistent, a mouthwatering mélange of caramel, chocolate, and nuts. Harmonious, seamless, and silky—you’d never guess the proof.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
95,Uncle Nearest 1820 Single Barrel 11 year old Tennessee Whiskey (Barrel US-1),,Bourbon/Tennessee,119,"A glass of this whiskey starts with a fragrant nose of honey blossom, wild strawberries, vanilla custard, and a dusting of cocoa powder. The palate is a complex mélange of cherries, blueberries, blackberries, mango, and orange marrying with dark chocolate, baking spice, lush oak, aged tobacco leaf, and a light espresso note. More richness and complexity on a delicious finish of chocolate, blackberry jam, walnuts, and coconut shavings.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
95,Mister Sam Tribute,,Canadian,250,"The first annual release of Sazerac’s finest old Canadian and American whiskies blended at barrel strength. The nose presents memories of long-closed whisky warehouses, old books, and artist’s oil paint. Prunes, dates, figs, chocolate-covered cherries, a cobbler’s shop, vague cloves, lilacs, brown sugar, and warming spices on the palate. Ultra-complex, rich, creamy, and fruity. Hot and mouth-watering with billows of vanilla, creamy caramel, and mincemeat. (1,200 bottles for the U.S. and Canada only) <em>Collectible</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2019
95,Chivas Regal The Icon,43.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,,"A spectacular citrus nose with incredible freshness; neroli oil, bergamot orange, an array of wood spices, baked apricot, dried strawberry, heather, lavender, honeysuckle, jasmine, and hyacinth. An intense array of citrus on the palate—the strongest being mandarin, it is thick-textured yet agile—accompanied by baked brioche, Ling heather honey, vanilla, and oak, with a hint of eucalyptus on the extraordinarily long finish. A masterclass in rare whisky blending.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
95,Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy,46.0,Irish Single Pot Still,260,"This is mastery of American oak! Polished wood, cinnamon cereals, dry spices of pepper, allspice, and paprika, and a riot of mostly overripe fruit: custard apple, mango, brown banana, baked apricot dessert, and fresh fig. Caramel, date slices, treacle, and cracker bread flavors are bathed in feisty pot still spices and fleeting green apple, before a lush, rich sweetness of banoffee pie, vanilla, and cinnamon descends. The finish is seemingly eternal.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
95,George T. Stagg 15 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection),,Bourbon/Tennessee,99,"This offers up warming ginger, candied orange, and wisps of furniture polish. The lavish and leathery oak flavors are apparent but don’t overwhelm the abundance of zippy, bright citrus—orange oil and yuzu—as the palate unleashes wave upon wave of spices that keep you guessing where it will head next. In the end, more lingering ginger and dusty cocoa.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
95,Highland Park 50 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"The nose of this veteran is hugely enticing; rich, with old leather, soft spices, sultanas, figs, polished oak, and dunnage warehouses. Tangy orange develops in time. The orange carries over onto the palate—amazingly vibrant and youthful fruitiness—followed by soft toffee, woodsmoke, and a sprinkling of dusty oak. The finish is extraordinarily long, with licorice and fruit-laden old oak. A true classic! (77 bottles in U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
95,Carsebridge 48 year old,,Single Grain Scotch,959,"Sure, the oldest of this year’s Diageo Special Releases manifests the brown-and-orange world of 1970 incarnate, but it does so in glorious fashion. Golden and warm, dessert-like, with bread-and-butter pudding, spun sugar, plenty of oak character, lavender honey, golden puff pastry, perfumery scents, and the first fruits plucked from the orangerie. Quite simply the grooviest thing to come out of Alloa this year. (1,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
95,Redbreast Cask Strength 12 year old (Batch B1/17),,Irish Single Pot Still,80,"The latest release pits plum, damson, fruitcake, and rosehip against wild, untamed pot still spices straining at the leash. Clove vociferously trumps raisin as the mouth-drawing power is realized; spices deflect off the tongue’s surface like sparks off an anvil. As its grip slackens, the fruit ripens, bruising slightly, yet sweetening deliciously, and vanilla pod, toasted stave, and cinnamon bark emerge. I swear you feel more Irish with every sip. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
95,Crown Royal Noble Collection 13 year old Blenders’ Mash,45.0,Canadian,60,"If Canada made bourbon (it doesn’t), it would taste like this massive dram. The mashbill of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley is identical to that used for Crown Royal Hand Selected Barrel Coffey rye. Beer still distillation and virgin oak barrels yield huge vanillas, rye spices, barrel tones, cherries, dark fruits, soaring floral esters, and gingery, peppery spices. Strong woodiness, slightly pulling tannins, and something almost chocolaty.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2018
95,Ardbeg Corryvreckan,,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Part of the permanent Ardbeg range since 2008, Corryvreckan is created from a blend of standard Ardbeg and Ardbeg aged in virgin French Limousin oak casks. Smoky bacon and seaweed, plus dark berries, prickly spices, walnuts, lemon, and sweet peat on the nose. Sweet and savory on the palate, with more lively spice, woodsmoke, phenols, and licorice. The finish is lengthy, with peat, sea salt, pepper, and black coffee. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
95,Royal Salute 28 year old Kew Palace Edition,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,790,"Fresh spring floral bouquets, white peach, and nectarine tumble with sweet caramel, dried cherry, white chocolate, fresh linen notes, and vanilla cake batter. Silky smooth with fresh summer fruits, the strong peppery spices push to the fore, but this is nimble, graceful, and displays a real lightness. Compelling, captivating blending for the Flask Collection by Sandy Hyslop, this has a fragrance you could enjoy all night.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
95,Kentucky Owl Rye 11 year old (Batch 1),,Rye Whiskey,130,"Just beautiful. Long, rounded notes of caramel, cinnamon roll, taffy, butterscotch, brisket burnt ends, nutmeg, Jamaican jerk, plum pudding, ginger, light sassafras, root beer, roasted marshmallow, cotton candy, orange peel, raw honey, and pie crust. If it sounds complex, it’s because it is, and the finish just doesn’t quit, giving you a lingering taste of every note.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
95,Midleton Dair Ghaelach Bluebell Forest,,Irish Single Pot Still,300,"Season 2 of Dair Ghaelach sees the action switch to six Irish oaks felled in a County Kilkenny bluebell forest. The balance of spice, toasted oak, and sweetness on the nose from tree one is singularly good, though clementine and grapefruit peel also clamor for attention. The acidity of the citrus collides with crunchy pot still spices, and grapefruit evolves into the most delicious ripe mango flavor. Simply heavenly.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
95,The Balvenie 1973 43 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,,"This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. Finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably, almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
95, William Larue Weller (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"This is a work of art. It begins by revealing vanilla, from custard to cake icing. Then it speaks caramel with a dark chew, crème brûlée, and Werther’s Original hard candy. From here, complexity takes over, with candied popcorn, butterscotch, chocolate ganache, French toast, maple, honey, pumpkin pie, fried pie dough, blueberries, and cinnamon, with hints of molasses and pecan. The long finish seems to offer a concentration of all the flavors. Delicious. Editor&#039;s Choice.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
95,J.P. Wiser’s 35 year old,50.0,Canadian,165,"Oh, the glory of used cooperage. Woody notes begone—let time slowly breathe life into what began as almost neutral, high-proof corn spirit. Creamy spice, barley sugars, peach syrup, dry grasses, and ancient barn boards. Incredible complexity, yet so tightly interwoven it achieves oneness. One hundred points until a campfire bursts onto the finish and consumes five of them.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2017
95,Method and Madness Single Pot Still Whisky Finished in French Chestnut,46.0,Irish Single Pot Still,77,"The thicker, air-dried staves of <em>Castanea sativa</em> have a lower density and greater porosity than American oak. The different wood breakdown products enhance the pot still style, bringing confectionery sweetness, dark prunes, and effusive lighter spices. It rolls out a thick red carpet of sweet spice, cinnamon, and clove, with more pot still weight than oak tannins. Move over Redbreast; my pick from this crazy, experimental Irish Distillers range.€69",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
95,Masterson’s 10 year old Rye (batch PSA3),45.0,Canadian,89,"This 100% rye-grain whisky is distilled in Alberta, then shipped to Sonoma, California for final touches. Finished in new American oak, batch PSA3 is one of the tastiest U.S. bottlings of Canadian rye ever. Soft caramels cushion ethereal honeysuckle, blackened firewood, and lusty rye spices on a framework of pulling oak tannins. Hugely complex, with new rewards in every sip<em>.</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2017
95,High West A Midwinter Night’s Dram (Act 3),,Rye Whiskey,80,"This is High West Rendezvous Rye finished in port and French oak barrels. It is a campfire pour. An arsenal of smoke, spice, and sweet, alternating back and forth. Just when you think the nuance ends, pronouncements of chocolate, cinnamon, plum, pepper spice, and barbecue. Its complexity hits a homerun, offering honey, red fruits, and citrus to a lingering, tickling, spicy finish. A must have. Sourced whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2016
95,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2015 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"Seamless in flavor and very elegant. A fully matured bourbon (consisting of whiskeys from 11 to 16 years in age), yet quite fresh on the palate. Lively fruit (apricot, red raspberry, tangerine) on a bed of lush sweet notes (caramel, honey-coconut crème brûlée and cotton candy), peppered with cinnamon, clove, and crisp mint. Soft finish, with lingering creamy vanilla. Not as great as the legendary 2013 release, but close.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
95,Sazerac Rye 18 year old,45.0,Rye Whiskey,80,"A benchmark rye whiskey, which has been stored in stainless steel tanks the past several years to prevent excessive aging while new batches mature. This is the last of the “tanked” stock. Soft and teasing for a rye whiskey, but perfectly balanced. Gentle toffee and molasses provide a foundation for interwoven clove, mint, and cinnamon. Delicately dry, lingering finish. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
95,Midleton Very Rare 30th Anniversary Pearl Edition,,Irish Blended Whiskey,,"A marriage of a single cask of grain from 1981 with a cask of pot still from 1984 to celebrate 30 years of Midleton Very Rare, the job undertaken masterfully by Barry Crockett and Brian Nation. The expressive nose is redolent of polished antique violin, warm gingerbread, the herbal tinges pricked by spices. Delicate honey, rich vanilla, toasty oak, and tendrils of cinnamon segue into a dry, spicy conclusion. La Peregrina of Irish whiskey. Ain’t she a beauty? (117 bottles) €6,000",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2015
95,Sazerac Rye 18 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"A benchmark aged rye whiskey, and it’s similar in profile to recent releases . Vibrant for its age. Complex too, brimming with allspice, clove, mint, and cinnamon. The spice notes are balanced by soft vanilla, soothing caramel, and candied summer fruits. Impeccably balanced, and a pure joy to drink!",John Hansell,Winter 2014
95,Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2014 Release),60.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Aged 11 years, this year’s single barrel release is a lively mix of caramel and bright, zingy orange on palate entry. Cinnamon, vanilla, and mint emerge mid-palate, leading to polished oak, baked apple, and a hint of leather on the finish. A lively bourbon, with crisp, clean flavors and nicely balanced. Another winner from Four Roses.",John Hansell,Fall 2014
95,Compass Box The Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Special Cask Strength Bottling,,Blended Scotch Whisky,120,"As you’d expect, solid peat is the first thing out of the glass, but this isn’t just a peat beast. Underneath are honey, dried fruit, and malt. The palate is all about balance, with honeyed malt, raisin, and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.  (<i>Park Avenue Liquor only</i>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Summer 2014
95,The Last Drop 50 year old,,Blended Scotch Whisky,4000,"Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup, buckwheat honey, roasted spices, blue grapes, pomegranate, raspberry compote, cilantro, pandan leaf, and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. The complex, lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness, molasses lashed by sherry before a dry, resinous finish. Water brings an oily nuttiness, then further drops produce a silky, clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious. (388 bottles only)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2014
95,Bowmore 50 year old (distilled 1961),,Single Malt Scotch,26650,"The whisky is sensational, a glorious mix of ginseng syrup, baked banana, semi-dried tropical fruits, and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last, you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time, there’s peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect, thrilling harmony: light nuttiness, pollen, subtle fruits, gentle smoke, and light fungal touches. It’s stunning, but it’s £16,000! Whisky this great, even in limited quantities, should be fairly priced. Points off. £16,000",Dave Broom,Spring 2014
95,Brora 35 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,750,"Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally, wood resin. The palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. <i>(2,944 bottles) </i>Editor&#039;s Choice",Gavin Smith,Spring 2014
95,William Larue Weller,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The traditionally gentle demeanor of this wheated bourbon is jazzed up with some lovely complex spice (mostly coming from the oak). Sweet notes of maple syrup, silky caramel, blackberry jam, and blueberry are peppered with notes of allspice spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Soft leather on the finish. Great balance. A lovely whiskey! Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
95,George T. Stagg,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Less alcohol than past Staggs, even at 128.2° proof. This whiskey has always been one of the best in the portfolio, and its reputation is intact. Sweeter and fuller in body than recent releases, and not as masculine, making it easier to drink. (Don’t worry; it’s still a big Stagg, but with a smaller “rack.”) Vanilla taffy, nougat, dates, polished oak, roasted nuts, leather, and tobacco: it’s all there. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
95,Sazerac 18 year old (bottled Fall 2013),45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Still lively for 18 years old, with no hint of interfering oak. The age has softened the rye spice, making it an easy entry into the premium rye category. The balance here is beautiful, with rounded spice (mint, cinnamon, licorice root) on a bed of soft vanilla and caramel. Gently, dry finish. Very sophisticated for a rye. It remains my benchmark for extra-matured rye whiskeys, which are becoming exceedingly scarce. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",John Hansell,Winter 2013
95,Sazerac 18 year old (bottled Fall 2012),45.0,Rye Whiskey,,"A perennial classic. Not aggressively bold like its younger sibling (Thomas H. Handy), but this is a rye of distinction and class. Still quite vibrant for its age, with plenty of spice (cinnamon, soft evergreen, vanilla, hint of nutmeg) softened and balanced by sweet notes (caramel, toffee), glazed citrus, and dried oak on the finish. This remains the benchmark for what a mature rye whiskey should taste like.  ",John Hansell,Winter 2012
95,William Larue Weller,,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"The key to bourbons that use wheat instead of rye (like this Weller), is to get the right amount of wood influence to balance the sweet notes and add depth. This whiskey does a great job of it. Notes of dark fruit (blackberry, plum, blueberry), layered sweetness (maple syrup, toffee, caramel), and dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla). Soft, pleasant finish.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
95,William Larue Weller,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"No age statement, but distilled in 1998. The only wheated recipe bourbon in the 2011 Antique Collection, and a very good one at that. Higher in strength than last year’s offering (which was 63.3%), but very similar (and equally as impressive). The most elegant and smoothest of this collection, with layered sweetness (honey, caramel, marzipan, maple syrup), fig, blackberry preserve, hint of green tea, and just the right amount of spice for balance (nutmeg, cinnamon, cocoa). ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
95,George T. Stagg,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"At this strength, it’s almost like getting two whiskeys for the price of one. A great value, considering its age. (It’s not identified on the label, but was distilled in 1993.) Try to find a great 18 year old, cask-strength single malt scotch for this price. Very mature — with a good dose of oak — but not excessively so. Notes of toffee, tobacco, dark molasses, roasted nuts, dried vanilla, leather, and a hint of dusty corn. Dry on the finish, with lingering leather and tobacco.",John Hansell,Winter 2011
95,Brora 2010,,Single Malt Scotch,,"Though Brora has acquired cult status, it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase, which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site, who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.

One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — I’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke, rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). In other words, this is robust and powerful, with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests, the seashore, and vellum. Hugely concentrated, with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. 

The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does, the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly — camphor, peach, membrillo, hints of citrus, and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]£280  ",Dave Broom,Spring 2011
95,Glenglassaugh,,Single Malt Scotch,,"An excellent example of an ultra-mature, sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy, jammy fruit, toasted walnut, leather, spice (cinnamon, clove), tobacco, and dark chocolate, with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky, you know it’s old, but you also know it’s very good. ",John Hansell,Spring 2011
95,Sazerac Rye,,Rye Whiskey,,"This was my second lowest rated whiskey from the 2009 Collection (a 91 rating). This one is an impressive whiskey, and an improvement from last year. It’s soft (for a straight rye), well rounded, and easy to embrace, with tamed spice (cinnamon, mint, vanilla, mocha), nougat, toffee, fruit (bramble, subtle citrus), subtle date, and polished leather on the finish. Buffalo Trace is playing a shell game with this aged rye (being stored in stainless steel tanks over the past several years until new stocks mature), but in this instance there seems to be a prize under every shell. Well done! (Editor's Choice)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
96,Canadian Club Chronicles 42 year old The Dock Man,45.0,Canadian,270,"The Chronicles collection debuted two years ago with the release of the 40 year old. This, the third annual release, incorporates a smidgen of younger rye and a dash of brandy. The nose and palate are deep and complex. Fruity and floral on the nose, with hints of raisin tarts, apple skins, and apricots. A sweet fruitiness, with mild peppers, baking spices, and a crisp, vaguely tannic backbone. Extended fruity, glowing finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
96,Forty Creek 22 year old Rye,43.0,Canadian,168,"Remarkably flavorful, with linen, oilcloth, dragon fruit, hints of cereal, dark fruits, warm peppers, creamy rye spices, vague chocolate, and coffee. Not overly sweet and just slightly floral. Viscous and creamy, yet massive, muscular, and so beautifully complex, balanced, and integrated. (102 bottles; Canada exclusive) $225 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2018
96,William Larue Weller 12 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection),,Bourbon/Tennessee,99,"Tilled earth, tobacco, and leather meet clover honey, maple syrup, and pecan pie sweetness. It pours broad and mouth-coating across the palate, with a lovely softness and pervasive vanilla and apple sweetness, gently tugged at by oaky tannins and more tobacco leaf. A touch floral and gently spiced, with cinnamon leading the way. Overall, this exudes beautiful balance right through the long finish that resonates both prettily and powerfully with dried citrus. <em>Collectible</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
96,Bushmills 21 year old,40.0,Irish Single Malt,150,"Bushmills’ sumptuous magnum opus spins aromas of sultana, brown sugar, walnut oil, date slice, chocolate-covered cranberries, leather gloves, and a hint of espresso. The dark, crepuscular mystique continues in the syrupy mouthfeel redolent of forest honey, banana bread, nuts, browned butter, sultana, date, and blackberry. Utterly beguiling, the Madeira finish works wonders here, right through to the last moments of the smooth, sweet finish. A must-try for all.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
96,Canadian Club Chronicles Issue No. 1 Water of Windsor 41 year old,45.0,Canadian,300,"Recently, a new “oldest Canadian whisky ever,” appears every year. In 2018, the honor goes to Canadian Club. Cedar lumber, fresh apricots, hints of bonfire, and sweet applewood on the nose. On the palate it’s butter tarts with vanilla, waves of pepper, pears, peaches, bonfire notes, and hints of pipe tobacco. Crisp, clean, and slightly bigger than Canadian Club 40 year old, the 41 is woodsy, silky, and mouth filling. (2,472 bottles for U.S.)",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2018
96,Yamazaki Mizunara Cask 18 year old (2017 Edition),48.0,Japanese,,"When whisky lovers talk about the grandeur of Japanese whisky, the enlightenment they desire can be found within this bottle. A refined luxury evocative of toasted marshmallow, sweet incense, butter-soft caramels, oak spices, and ground cinnamon. All the hallmarks of mizunara are here. Concentrated sweet citrus, so intensely fruity on the palate; the mouthfeel is rapturously silky with touches of mango, dried apricot, and gentle but resilient spices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
96,Canadian Club 40 year old,45.0,Canadian,199,"After 40 years in barrels, the trademark Canadian Club dark fruit is as rich as ever. Reminiscent of raisin tarts with sprinkles of sweet baking spices, then strawberries and black pepper. Warming but never hot. No tannins, no woodiness; silky barrel tones are the only hint of oak, while soaring floral esters speak loudly of time in the barrel. The glowing, never-ending finish is spectacular. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$250

96,Four Roses Small Batch Limited Edition Al Young’s 50th Anniversary (2017 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"A caramel-laden fruit bouquet, followed by unending vanilla, leather, tobacco, cotton candy, marshmallow, quince, cinnamon, hints of juniper, and wildflowers. Then, brown sugar butter and maple syrup over buttermilk pancakes, Cracker Jack, raw honey, bittersweet chocolate, and hints of pecan shell. Extremely long finish with a fried apple pie note. An incredibly complex and intense, must-have sipper. Perfection.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2017
96,The Last Drop (distilled at Lochside) 1972 (cask 346),44.0,Grain Scotch Whisky,3108,"A remarkable beauty from the Angus town of Montrose. The elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup, hay bales, ground hazelnut, liquid honey, French baguette, High Mountain oolong, and rubbed spice blends. Refreshing palate of honey, toffee, citrus, honeycomb wax, and a profusion of sweet vanilla. Rich, sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. Truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) £2,400",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
96,Teeling Vintage Reserve Collection 24 year old,46.0,Irish,499,"Wow—the nose is spellbinding. An exuberant mix of heavy fruit and deep sweetness: crème brûlée, vanilla pod, fruit syrups, sticky jam tarts, and apricot stone. Silken mouthfeel, with orange flan and brown sugar, growing increasingly tangy, with peppery spice rippling over the tongue and hints of smoke at the end. Oak char and marzipan fruits on the finish. The bar has been set high for Irish whiskey this year. (5,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2017
96,Chivas Regal Ultis,40.0,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,160,"Captivating, enticing, and wonderfully charming, this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval. Red apple, cherry, raspberry fudge, peach and mango fruit salad, dusting of cinnamon, and dry heather sprigs. In essence, it’s rich and satisfying, with dark vanilla, apricot, Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts, and tangerine, smoothed over by caramel and wood spices, maltiness, and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor&#039;s Choice",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
96,Redbreast 25 year old,53.0,Irish Single Pot Still,520,"Celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of a Parisian retailer, this represents the most mature Redbreast of the modern era. Rich dark prunes, papaya, and the aroma of polished antique furniture. Treacle, oily and weighty, baked apple, Black Forest <em>gateaux</em>, char, and sizzling spices, with new flavors appearing minute by minute. Water encourages cherry to the nose and pomegranate to the taste buds. The faithful will respond to the call. (540 bottles, <em>La Maison du Whisky only</em>) €490",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2017
96,John E. Fitzgerald Very Special Reserve 20 year old,45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,300,"Distilled at the now legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery. Rich aromas of vanilla toffee, marzipan, cocoa, nutmeg and cinnamon. Similar follow-through on the palate, with black raspberry, maple syrup, teaberry, and dusty dried corn thrown into the mix. Warming cinnamon and polished oak on the finish. The sweet notes balance and integrate nicely with the oak. An exemplary rendition of an ultra-aged wheated bourbon. Price is per 375 ml. Editor&#039;s Choice.",John Hansell,Winter 2015
96,The Exclusive Malts 13 year old 2002 (cask #20021),,Irish,135,"This 13 year old malt from central Ireland is an uncommon foray into the Irish whiskey space for the Exclusive Malts Collection. Pure malt is the focus of the nose which supports that malt with tart green apple. On the palate this whiskey is a stunning mix of lush, sweet honey, salt, malt, green apple, and ginger spice. The balance and integration are nothing short of perfect. A long malty finish caps off one of the best Irish whiskeys I’ve had. (<em>U.S. only</em>)",Geoffrey Kleinman,Fall 2015
96,George T. Stagg,,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"No age statement, but distilled in 1998. A beautiful expression of Stagg, and a lot of bourbon for your buck. Easy to drink with the addition of water, showing caramel, nougat, dates, dark chocolate, polished oak, along with a hint of leather and tobacco. Slightly better than last year’s release—richer, thicker, and more balanced. I’m enjoying Stagg’s more rounded, less aggressive demeanor of late. A classic! Editor&#039;s Choice.",John Hansell,Winter 2014
96,Crown Royal Monarch,40.0,Canadian,75,"Monarch, the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary limited edition of Canada’s best-selling whisky, raises the already high Crown Royal flavor bar. Zesty rye from an ancient Coffey still is the throbbing heart of this blend, balancing cloves, ginger, cinnamon, glowing hot pepper, and that gorgeous sour bitterness of rye grain against crispy, fresh-sawn lumber, fragrant lilacs, dark fruits, and green apples. Butterscotch, chocolate, toffee, mint, pine needles, and sweet pitchy balsam enrich a luscious, creamy mouthfeel carefully tempered by grapefruit pith. Editor&#039;s Choice",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2014
96,Glenfarclas Family Casks 1954 (Cask #1260),,Single Malt Scotch,,"A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruits—pineapple, dried peach, apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time, sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate, while fragile, still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water, allowing richer, darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful, long, and resonant. Superb, not over-wooded, and a fair price for such a rarity. £1,995",Dave Broom,Fall 2014
96,"Booker’s 2014-01 “25th Anniversary Batch,” 65.4%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"The complete package: uncut, unfiltered, full-flavored, richly textured (almost chewy), and very complex. Notes of toffee-coated nuts, vanilla fudge, polished leather, cedar-tinged tobacco, barrel char, cocoa powder, and a hint of fig, wrapped up with a firm oak grip on the finish. Worth every penny of the premium price being charged for this commemorative release. Editor&#039;s Choice.",John Hansell,Summer 2014
96,Compass Box The General,,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,325,"With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie, only 1,698 bottles produced, and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old, the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn&#039;t, but it&#039;s superb, rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office, fresh polish, and Sunday church, with spices, oak dried fruits, squiggly raisins, and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story.",Dominic Roskrow,Spring 2014
96,Redbreast 21 year old,46.0,Irish,180,"Wow! After the wonderful 12 year old cask strength, Redbreast does it again. This is a different beast altogether, but it is a stunner. This is Roger Waters doing The Wall: over the top, unsubtle, and totally entertaining. There’s lots going on: fermenting apples, juicy oils, spice, and dark cherry and berry fruits zip and fizz over the palate, the wood influence is sublime. I'm comfortably numb.",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2013
96,Yoichi 1988 single cask,62.0,Japanese,250,"Though aged in virgin American oak, it’s distillery character that’s in charge here; a fully expressive Yoichi. Rich, mysterious, layered, mixing rich fruit compote with scented coastal smoke (ozone, tar, soot) alongside masses of vetiver and cigar humidor. The palate is oily and immense, with fluxing layers of sweet fruit, oily peat, salt, and ink; camphor, flax seed, and in among the smoke, apple mint. Long, insanely complex, and jaw-droppingly good. This will go down as a classic. €185",Dave Broom,Winter 2013
96,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2012 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A marriage of four different bourbons, ranging from 11 to 17 years old. This, to me, is benchmark Four Roses: subtly complex, vibrant, yet fully matured, with well-defined flavors of bramble, dry citrus, soft creamy vanilla, caramel, marzipan, allspice, a hint of cinnamon, and subtle cedar-aged cigar tobacco.  Soft, clean, polished oak finish. A very versatile bourbon! Your decision shouldn’t be whether to buy it, but rather how much water to add.",John Hansell,Winter 2012
96,George T. Stagg,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Another excellent Stagg, and considering its alcohol level, it’s also a good value if you can get it at this price. Notes of toffee, pot still rum, nougat, dates, tobacco, roasted nuts, polished oak, and leather. Great depth and nicely balanced. A masculine bourbon of character and structure.  ",John Hansell,Winter 2012
96,Pappy Van Winkle’s Family Reserve 15 year old,,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Sometime recently, the source of this whiskey changed from the now defunct Stitzel-Weller distillery to Buffalo Trace. No matter. This whiskey is still the best of the Van Winkle line. It’s crisp, clean, vibrant, impeccably balanced, and nicely matured. Complex fruit (bramble, candied citrus), caramel, coconut custard, maple syrup, fresh spice (vanilla, warming cinnamon, nutmeg, a dusting of cocoa powder) on a bed of nougat. Outstanding! (<em>Editor&#039;s Choice</em>)",John Hansell,Summer 2012
96,Sazerac Rye 18 year old,45.0,Rye Whiskey,,"Very similar to last year’s release. Well rounded, with a gently sweet foundation (toffee, vanilla taffy), pleasant spice (cinnamon, mocha, soft evergreen), date, glazed citrus, bramble, and a gentle finish for a rye. A classic ultra-aged rye whiskey. ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
96,Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength,,Irish Single Pot Still,101,"Irish Distillers has already released two 90+ pot still whiskeys this year, but this is the knockout blow, an immense take on the wonderful Redbreast. The nose gives little away, all damp autumn leaves and fermenting forest fruit, but on the palate it&#039;s a fireworks display, a colorful mix of apple and pear, berries, vine fruits, chocolate liqueur, and oily pureed fruit. It&#039;s coming to the States soon, and rumor has it there&#039;s more to follow. But this will do. I can&#039;t think if I&#039;ve ever tasted a better Irish whiskey. €75",Dominic Roskrow,Winter 2011
96,"Elijah Craig Barrel No. 3,735 20 year old",45.0,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"From one barrel, and only sold in one location, but well worth the effort to procure a bottle. Nutty toffee, pecan pie, apricot, berried jam, and nougat, peppered with cinnamon, mint, cocoa, and tobacco. Warming, with polished leather and dried spice on the finish.  Seamless, richly textured, and impeccably balanced. (Exclusive to the Bourbon Heritage Center at the Heaven Hill distillery in Bardstown, KY.) ",John Hansell,Winter 2011
96,Jefferson’s Presidential Select,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Unlike the standard “small batch” releases, this is from a single barrel: a really good single barrel. I rated the 18 year old small batch a 93 in the last issue, and I like this one even better. There’s less wood getting in the way. It’s softer, more elegant. Lovely fruit, gently sweet (black raspberry jam, blueberry pie), with nougat, creamy vanilla, a sprinkling of cinnamon, and polished leather on the finish. And so drinkable. Classic stuff!",John Hansell,Summer 2011
96,Bowmore 40 year old,,Single Malt Scotch,11000,"Definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. Fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I’ve ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (Editor&#039;s Pick) ",John Hansell,Summer 2011
96,William Larue Weller,,Bourbon/Tennessee,,"Very similar to last year’s release. (A good thing, since it was wonderful!) Very smooth, with layered sweetness (toffee, fig cake, nougat, maple syrup), dark fruit (black raspberry, blueberry), cinnamon, and polished oak on the finish. A whisky of elegance and sophistication. (Editor's Choice)",John Hansell,Spring 2011
97,Johnnie Walker Blue Label,40.0,Blended Scotch Whisky,225,"Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels, dried peats, elegant cigar smoke, seeds scraped from vanilla beans, brand new pencils, peppercorn, coriander seeds, and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels, bountiful fruits of ripe peach, stewed apple, orange pith, and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke, dry spices, and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. <em>Editor&#039;s Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
97,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2013 Release),,Bourbon/Tennessee,85,"A marriage of 13 and 18 year old bourbons. A mature yet very elegant whiskey, with a silky texture and so easy to embrace with a splash of water. Balanced notes of honeyed vanilla, soft caramel, a basket of complex orchard fruit, blackberry, papaya, and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg; smooth finish. Sophisticated, stylish, with well-defined flavors. A classic!",John Hansell,Winter 2013
97,Bowmore 46 year old (distilled 1964),,Single Malt Scotch,13500,"There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor&#039;s Choice.",Dave Broom,Fall 2012
